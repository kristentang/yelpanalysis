{28105, Bourquin Residential Group, 2920 E Camelback Rd Ste100 Phoenix AZ 85016, this place is awful nickel and dime you at every chance they get horribly irresponsible refuse to return emails or calls from renters promised to fix damage from previous tennant but refused after move in to actually fix the damage terri bourquin is the most unethical horrible agent i have ever come into contact with avoid at all costs this company is awful they dont call you back and instead if they even respond they send an e mail theyre always conveniently out of the office they rented me a home that was not up to code at all the whole front half of the electrical did not work ive had a broken dryer for months and they wont respond to me or maintenance because they dont want to pay for it even though it is in my lease they dont care what conditions people live in as long as they get their money do i have to even give one star ill tell you very specifically why this company is just the worst upon move in the month house we rented had obviously not been cleaned had enormous carpet stains a very dirty refrigerator and cabinets and had smelly bulk trash lining the driveway for several days we notified them of the broken ac within the first week we were there about the ac was not repaired until august in phoenix we experienced huge plumbing issues beginning and i notified them that day these werent attended to until when i texted will pictures of what we were experiencing and when we asked for help in meeting the plumber at the house that day so that my children and i could escape the sewage fumes and go to my in laws in goodyear the only people we know in arizona will said he was unavailable but that hed try and find someone to let the plumber in and then he never texted me about it again we dont know anyone here and had no place to go so the kids and i were forced to sit in the running car in the september heat for several hours before the plumber arrived our breathing the sewage fumes was not a priority to them and it wasnt until we demanded it that an industrial cleaner came to clean the huge mess that evening also as soon as we reported plumbing issues their office sent us a document over and over asking us to sign it the verbiage in the document seemed to relieve them from any responsibility for plumbing issues or something to that effect the timing of their persistent asking us to sign it was very suspicious to us so we did not sign it the plumbing issues were not resolved until after i informed will of the roof or ac leak on we were told someone would contact us for scheduling repairs but no one contacted us until after i notified will again on that the leak was happening again each time it rained we had damp carpeting and ceiling for weeks finally on a repairman came but he left a film of drywall dust was left all over our bedroom furniture and bedding and the carpeting then that contractor promised a deep clean of the bedroom walls doors and carpeting but none of that ever happened i informed bourquin via email of our needing to break the lease on and they replied saying they would send me pertinent paperwork the following day it wasnt until my second request for it days later that they sent it that is advertising days lost we simply cant determine the costloss of that a clear theme through all of these problems is a lack of concern or timeliness on the part of bourquin residential group it felt as though as long as they got their money we never heard from them unless we kicked and screamed conversely we were nothing but punctual with our rental payments each month we kept the house tidy and neat and were warm and friendly neighbors we are good agreeable reasonable tenants but our experience in this home and with their management was terrible these guys are the best in town terri is a pro and treats her clients with respect as a property owner they are the best team i have had in the past years}

{35764, Office Max, 21001 North Tatum Blvd. #24 Phoenix AZ 85050, i am truly disappointed with office max about years ago i went in to get some copies made and had a great experience that was once and years ago it has gotten progressively worse i am actually mad at myself for not doing something different sooner i put out a print newsletter every month to about people and every month i stop in to get my printing done at this store because my company has contract pricing i have just put up with the crap service because the pricing was good but i cant bear to give any more of my money to this place today was the straw of straws i go in and find the impress counter completely unattended i park it and wait i see a few employees walk by in the distance and i can only say that they must train people on the whole no eye contact thing eventually a guy walks in with his big drink he got on his break and asks me if ive been helped not yet i say as he walks past he takes the disk and pops it in about a minute later the grumpy guy that i try to avoid because he depresses me walks in seriously i have only seen this guy when i am in this store and i feel like i know every damn ache and pain in the guys life and guy hands me off how many guy asks in color i respond im all excited because this is my first newsletter in color he looks at me like i am insane and says theyre cents each as if i am gonna run off crying ok and i need them folded also i respond by the way this is all in the presence of guy who handed me off the printer starts jamming and i watch as my stuff finishes and sits there i am standing feet from the counter watching guy guy talking about something that did not seem anywhere near as important as they were making it out to be i see guy take a glance over at my copies clock out and walk away by now guy has happily discovered that there is an attractive lady that has wandered over to the counter and he is all over it again i sit and listen to guy talking now to this lady in way greater detail than she is even interested in and for me to notice body language like that it must be obvious eventually guy makes his way over to my stuff hits the folding machine and goes to ring me up he puts everything in and presents me with a total that is each copy plus folding about what happened to cents each i ask oh that was um per side he responds come on maybe that works with a foreign tourist or something but seriously come on dont you think that would have been an important detail to mention before the printing i ask guy looks annoyed looks down hits some buttons like they owe him money and presents me with a new total at cents each i pay i leave and i will never go back i dont want people to freak out with joy when i walk in but for gods sake please recognize the fact that i have been coming in every month for years also dont pull some stupid price change on me at the register finally have at least a basic shred of customer service service i swear this place is like a huge kinkos everyone that works there truly believes that they are doing you a favor by giving you their time anyhoo i am done and i would recommend finding some no anyplace else for printing office max no matter which one you seem to go to these days is just plain average the prices are outrageous and i find that funny because they will be located right near other places that sell the same product for much less but they will never lower their prices dont know how they have been in business so long but at this rate by next year they will be going out of business as well eat drink and be merry my friends the service has gone way down im a long time customer and their treatment of customers like myself is not to be desired i needed some scanning done and was very happy with the customer service i didnt have to wait and they were very helpful prices are very reasonable as well i normally prefer to support local businesses but was in a hurry this time and if i need this service again will break out of my box and go here best customer service michael was very helpful in my exchange of a print cartridge i will definitely be back again thank you michael do not buy toner or other office supplies here not only are the prices mark up they charged a restocking fee when i returned the product go to cartridge world at bell and th street same products for less standing out front and andrew from inside runs out to find people who forgot their personal items inside july good job bro items not in stock why advertise on shelf and on sale furthermore the manager sofia would not provide any customer relief to discount other items i would call ahead if you want to buy any electronics or furniture items advertised may not be in store but hey if you want pens and paper you got it}
{53386, Mika's Greek, 1336 N Scottsdale Rd Scottsdale AZ 85257, great guys great food plus right next to one of my favorite bars this location has been many different restaurants over the years this is a tough spot this is my favorite thing its been though the food is great here and the owner is cool the prices are really reasonable and the portions are large the place is really clean and the decor is nice everything is cooked in plain sight so theres no mystery my only complaint would be that he doesnt deliver yet we definitely need a good gyro place that delivers in the area seriously though the food is really delicious if you like flavors its all really flavorful great hummus too try the pizza puff wow i am sitting here with a full belly absolutely impressed with the meal i just had fresh flavorful and not too heavy if i hadnt eaten like a million of the french fries it would probably pass as healthy the owner was really nice and my to go order was up quickly its right next to british open pub so i can see a few post drink meals happening in my future oh the hummus was amazing when i saw it i expected it to be a little gritty and bland but it was anything but it has a great flavor but not too lemony or garlicy cant put my finger on exactly what is so awesome about it but it is actually even now as im as uncomfortably full as i am im thinking about having another bite of it this neighborhood niche is one of my favorite local restaurants give this place a shot people good guys great food ok so there is this georges gyros and one on mckellips i am a greek salad lover so get them often unfortunately i have to say that the georges on mckellips does a much better greek salad its cents more but you get a lot more salad along w more peppers cucumbers and olives and they also throw in a yummy piece of garlic bread georges on scottsdale does have a good salad it is just not up to par to the one you get from mckellips so i am hoping that they will read this and raise the bar a bit great service super nice guy at the counter gyro meat amazing lots of meet in the pita location good atmophere so so i would hit this place up for take out so amazing probably the closest thing to an authentic greek gyro i have had since i moved back from greece a year ago kalo not to be confused by the georges gyros on mckellips and miller this location is definitely a bar above that one the restaurant itself is very clean air conditioned and pleasant to be inside tvs are present to keep you entertained while you dine in or wait for your take out order it was a little hard to find as its on the backside of papago plaza i didnt even know this place was there until i found myself lost and starving the food is pretty standard greek food delicious gyros greek salad etc more often than not delivered by a greek god of an owner its nearly worth going to this place just to see him we love this place i work at asu skysong and my coworkers and i frequent this shop for lunch the service is always great the food is good and the baklava is to die for we also have them cater for our office on occasion and they have never disappointed definitely a good place to check out i work near by minute walking distance and come here often if you are a first timer try the original gyro with fries or salad you will not be dissappointed have also tried their chicken pita specifically the chicken hani pita and it was excellent love the salad they give on the side with every pita dish place is clean staff is very friendly two large screen tvs cannot go wrong for the price highly recommended fantastic grilled chicken pitta and gyro picante ordered with salads absolutely great loads of flavor great portion size and great value defiantly become a regular haunt staff were so helpful and happy great to chat with while waiting for the awesome food very yummy chicken pita clean and great friendly service best place in the valley for a gyro or greek salad the gyro picado is my favorite always made perfectly fresh and juicy the restaurant is clean and the staff is always friendly they have other locations which are equally great cant go wrong with the gyro salad or the picado gyro awesome food well priced and great service one of the better hummuses ive had in az and the gyros are delicious the prices are reasonable as well first time there today for lunch and i am definitely a fan now the salad is excellent the chicken moist and tender the hummus and pita starter is delicious too i will definitely be going back love the food here this is our go to place for lunch or fast take out dinner do not get this place confused with georges on mckellips and miller with failing health inspections food was very good tried the gyro picado a pleasant spice to the meat i love a good gyro and this place makes them amazing i ordered a traditional gyro to go and was out the door in less than minutes good for my lunch break i plan on going again for lunch today rock solid new design the chipotle of gyros in scottsdale highly recommend the picado some of the best hummus ive had in a long time the remodel from the previous gyro restaurant is gorgeous no more of the ubiquitous blue white greek theme i also had a greek salad with chicken it was delicious as well i will go back for more mikas was great not only the food was great and very reasonable staff is friendly and knowledgable about everything on the menu the owner is right there in the front talking to the customers i will definately be back this is a medium size greek restaurant on the side of papago plaza i wish it was at a more visible location this year they renovated their place and improved their menu i come here twice or thrice a week for lunch as it closest and best place to eat near my workplace even though i prefer eating at home it is not always feasible so mika comes to my rescue i do feel that their food has too much of sodium atleast more than what should be there is a healthy food i know that high sodium content in food is a problem all across us but it doesnt hurt expecting from a place you eat out a lot the service was very nice i havent really eaten greek food before and the last was really nice explaining the differences between the meals id liked it a lot yum the food is great the restaurant is clean and the team was friendly and quick the menu provides various options and being close to work is a plus as well i highly recommend the picado pita your traditional gyro with a kick of jalapeno great food awesome service but above all one of the cleanest restaurants ive ever been to i would recommend this restaurant in a heart beat great food great atmosphere and great staff stars is an understatement i would recommend this place to everyone cant wait to go back and try the rest of the menu beautiful place very modern and classic super sweet staff awesome hidden gem in this area best gyro meat ive ever tasted plus the owner has an infectious smile dont judge a book by its cover considering this is in papago plaza mikas greek is very nice inside with a modern twist the food is always fresh and the customer service is on point excellent clean great place and great food very good fresh salad chicken perfectly spiced this place has great food i love their fresh salads with grilled chicken and their gyros are the best went here after a couple of months the place is now almost times bigger very clean the waiters are very nice and orders come up really fast ordered the falafel pita sandwich and it was really good would definitely recommend this for a quick greek lunch tasty and fresh great value clean friendly definitely worth a try and youll be back simply wonderful delicious our first experience was great the staff is friendly the building is clean modern and the food was delicious we ordered the chicken platter and gyro platter each come with two sides of your choice so we got salads rice and gyro fries for our sides yum if youre a big soda drinker they have the coca cola freestyle drink machine with different sodas and flavor combos i rarely order a drink and i had to get one just to try it vanilla rootbeer and vanilla gingerale yes please we just moved to this side of town and i cant wait to go back again mikas serves up quick fresh flavorful greek food that you can take to go or eat in all food is made fresh to order the wait time for your food is normally minutes depending on what you get but when in rush you can call an order in ahead of time they make everything from salads to gyros to full meals the prices are reasonable its a great place for lunch or a simple dinner the restaurant is well maintained modern and very comfortable but not easily spotted from n scottsdale road they also offer free wi fi this is my go to place for something quick tasty and fairly healthy check it out this place is fantastic scottsdale needed a good fresh greek place that wasnt run by a bunch of dodgy characters love the atmosphere but nothing tops the food healthy fresh delicious first time here and will definitely be back i had the original picato and it was fantastic the place was very clean and the staff was well versed on the menu and very friendly and helpful cant wait to come back and try something else ill keep it short and simple food is great cool ambiance and they have a coke freestyle soda machine to top it off awesome little greek place i just moved in across the street scored with this being my favorite food i could live on hummus and theirs rocks the jalapeno hummus is superb best ive ever tasted plain is excellent but has lots of garlic which is good for some some not i loved it falafel is obviously homemade vs pasty mix to go order was fast easy christian gave great friendly reception inside very nice clean cut a bit above average strip mall casual outdoor seating available ill be a regular check them out i would give stars if they had babaganoush an out of town friend and i stopped here today on our way to the desert botanical gardens clean friendly staff quick service really yummy food thanks the falafel is delicious and fresh the mediterranean pita is delicious the tziki and hummus are great try the greek fries you wont be sorry the service was good and the people were friendly everything was clean and welcoming put mikas in your mouth amazing awesome staff food was fresh and delicious and fast i am right up the street from this place and i am happy that i can walk here and get good foods mediterranean pita and greek fries do it i was in the area looking to kill sometime and grab a quick bite when i stopped in and the place looked cute clean nice staff and the menu looked pretty good i ordered the veggie souvlaki and for i would have expected more veggies than taziki sauce it was basically dipping pita bread in taziki sauce and have maybe a small handful of chopped up veggies i wont be coming back for the meal i had very good and freshly prepared quick food greekmed food clean modern space with nice seating i just moved into the neighborhood and was delighted to find mikas and find is the key word it is located in the papago plaza strip mall abit of s pueblo kitsch and like pretty much all the businesses there has no road signage it is on the southwestern side of the mall on the scottsdale road side worth looking for yum so fresh and delicious the greekumbers were so delicious im addicted so good we had two gyros with a greek salad the were tasty very flavorful will definitely be going back loved it i honestly did not expect much when coming to this restaurant but its got an awesome little vibe to it great prices and good food the front hostesscashier amy was super friendly and totally cool she was very helpful with getting my order exactly right which really meant a lot i gave it stars because of the food quality compared to the low price and because of the amy at the front i was impressed their falafel and gyro were amazing their dolmeh was a bit cold and their greek fries had too much feta i hope they also fix their ice machine for some reason this place reminds me of chipotle which is a good thing overall i was full and satisfied dont really eat greek food as its not very popular locally but i would always try any food at least once and i really glad that i came to mikas one night this place was tucked in the very back at a shopping plaza between scottsdale tempe it was hard to find at first but lucky i found this gem in time before they closed for the night i ordered mediterranean chicken pita with fries and my friend ordered original tyro pita also with fries and since this is greek food falafel appetizer is a must so we ordered that as well the flavoring was very tasty but im still not a fan of this type of food but at least i gave it a try hopefully ill have better review next time this review requires very little all i want to say is you have to eat here me and my wife are frequent customers and we recommend mikas greek to everyone we know the food is absolutely amazing like the melt in your mouth chicken souvlaki is a must they also have the valleys greek salad in my opinion defiantly go for dinner tonight the food is amazing staff is super friendly place is clean and really nice had the greek sampler and a side of lamb it was yummy this place is so delicious i work nearby and always stop here once a week for lunch tried almost everything on menu and everything is delicious of course their gyro sandwich is my favorite i stopped in at the recommendation of a friend sounded good so i thought id give it a try it must have been somewhere between lunch and dinner when i got there as the place was barren clean not too large and i was greeted as i walked in the door high marks for that the menus are high tech and on digital tv screens above your head the cashier owner gave me a moment to figure out what i wanted not being too hungry i chose a greek salad and some greek fries both were delicious ordering to go or to stay i made the assumption it would all be packaged the same but i was wrong since i dine in my food was brought to my table on china with metal silverware it was unexpected and quite nice im definitely going to go back for something more meaty i highly recommend you do the same enjoy never had a bad visit here this is the hidden gem of scottsdale fresh food friendly customer service and no wait if i had to pick one thing that stood out to me it would have to be the cleanliness cleanest restaurant ive ever been to definitely recommend mikas to all my friends im not an expert on greek food but i love this place good quickservice and the gyros are just how i llike em used to be my favorite take out salad but they have cut the portion in half and charge the same amount okay just yes mikas is awesome i love the modern update they made to the inside of the restaurant last year the food is so good i love the euro meat but the chicken is great too last night i tried the diablo wrap and it was the perfect amount of spicy the greek fries are an absolute must fresh french fries with greek dressing and feta cheese i mean feta cheese and french fries obviously its good the employees are friendly and its quick and fresh i really recommend its in the plaza off mcdowell and sky song road check it out first time i have been here like others i was impressed by the cleanliness and modern feel of the building what really stood out though was the food i had the greekpeno pita with the beef souvlaki which was wonderfully spiced the greek fries were also amazing with the dressing and feta generous put on top of the fries i thought the peppers would overpower the dish but it all mingled very well together service was great and the employees were nice will definitely be back again all of the dishes have so much flavor service is quick and the place is spotless try the mikas fries if you are feeling adventurous i love the modern feel of mikas and if you like siracha you will be in heaven yummy greek food i came here for a lunch meeting and definitely enjoyed the gyro wrap with fries the restaurant is very clean and the staff is friendly and professional for the most part the fountain drink machine gives you large selection of sodas to choose from with unlimited refills it was my first time there so i wanted to try a nice wrap but the menu definitely has various salads and other items i will definitely be trying soon i would recommend this to anyone look for quick and good greek food tha bomb food was awesome place was nice and clean and to top it off the cashierwaiter was hot place is clean and nice i wanna give it more stars because the food is not bad not great tho but the price just doesnt add up for what they give you pita sandwiches probably should cost chicken salad probably should be also i hate being nickel and dimed for small stuff like cents to add tomatoes plenty of other gyro spots that are just as good for cheaper fresh delicious and conveniently quick ive been twice and the foodservice is consistently top notch the chipotle of greek food love the redesign inside food was great me my sister split the greek salad mika fries baklava sundae food came out quickly and was delish ill be back nice little place with nice people tried jalapeno hummus large palate with grilled greek chicken and falafel food is awesome would be perfect if a couple more beverage options are there this place was great for the prices they really give you a good portion of well cooked food the diablo gyro pita is delicious their mika fries are delicious the souvlaki has a really good flavor to it youd be hard pressed to find a greek restaurant thatll have as good of food for the price its the same prices pretty much as pita jungle but better food the ambiance is modern and goes well service was good and the place is clean i will definitely come back here again the gyro sandwich and greek salad were excellent looking forward to coming back in the future i have been coming here since before it was mikas and they always do a good job i wish the prices were a bit lower but the place is big and i would assume its a fairly high rent area that aside i have never had a bad meal here the portions are good and you all know i love my gyros the service is fast and the food is fresh they have plenty of seating and the ambiance is nice excellent greek food service was great and fast the flavors were full and bold i had a small platter with gyro meat and side greek salad my friend had the diablo gyro i will def return great food clean establishment and the portions are good size i will definitely try this joint again and try something new this place is really nice and clean inside i ran inside to order my food and the cashier i think her name was amy helped me out i paid and ran back to my car that was still running because my dog was inside i usually never take him with me in the summer but the power was out in my neighborhood and it was too hot to leave him home i explained my situation to the lady at the counter anywho i saw her pack my food and then she brought it out to me i know this is a simple act but it really means a lot to me when someone takes an extra step to make your day easier or better the chicken was amazing but i mostly give stars for the customer service i will be back soon thanks amy this place is the real deal went for lunch on a saturday before labor day the place was pretty quiet nice decor very friendly staff and the food was excellent chicken served with greek salad was fresh juicy and perfectly grilled greekumbers sounded goofy but they tasted great cucumbers tzaziki and feta surprisingly good looking forward to the next visit this place is so put together organized and delicious that i had always thought they were part of a national chain but they are actually locally and family owned big props to the mikha family they have plenty of vegetarian options and i always make sure to get a side of their lentil soup its amazingly delish and fresh tasting its sort of the opposite of georges highly recommended and i will always come back i tried this place for the first time last night and man was i pleasantly surprised i got the gyropeno and definitely was full after they gave a generous portion of gyro meat as well as sauces we took it to go but the restaurant was very clean when we picked it up the girl who rang us up was super nice and made small talk while i waited i will definitely be back to try more of the menu i love mikas my girlfriend and i often find ourselves wandering in once a week when we do not feel like cooking but dont want to eat garbage food out in a society where we constantly have disgusting fake food pushed in our face it is nice to know there are still options out there that serve real food the service is phenomenal the ladies behind the counter are always very nice even when we stroll in at pm and they close at pm id be grumpy we usually dine in and the food is brought out to us in a very timely manner usually still piping hot the food every time i go i get the chicken picado with basmati rice every single time i get a tingly feeling in my loins after i eat it when i am balling out i get extra chicken more on this later i put some siracha on the rice and go to work i would probably eat here everyday if could and never get tired of it the one downfall pricing it is decently priced for a standard meal however if you like to spice it up and get extras you can really run up the tab extra meat is and extra veggies etc is dont matter doe ill still go back close to work easy and fast will go back dont need to write more just because i think its simply good rl my go to spot if im looking for a quick healthy option food is tasty with great quality ingredients not your typical greasy late night greek spot the restaurant itself was recently remodeled and very cute inside and service is always very fast loved everything had a greek salad with gyro and about licked the plate best gyros best tzaziki and super clean awesome first time here was great hummus was awesome food was great excellent service too will be back i tried this place for the first time a week ago and i was really impressed everything was really fresh i had the gyro plate with rice you can tell that they do really care about there customers i can tell it was really clean and new this place was built off tradition great place to stop into you want to get something fresh and quick yummy greek food really liked it i was looking for a place near old town with not too pricey food and mikas greek sounded like a good option my boyfriend is not too adventurous when it comes to food and trying new restaurants but he liked this place a lot and told me hed like to come back its kind of in a weird location we went at night and had a bit of trouble finding it right away also there was a person being arrested directly in front of mikas greek which freaked us out a bit there werent too many people inside we didnt have to wait to order which was nice i ended up getting the appetizer platter with extra falafel with no domaldes i asked if i could get rice instead of domaldes but she said you can only really ask for more falafel wasnt too expensive and was a large quantity of food my boyfriend went for the chicken with fries one meat one side plate it also came with pita and tzatziki my platter had falafel pita hummus and tzatziki it was really good the hummus had a great texture and flavor tzatziki was a bit too garlicky for me left me with smelly breath but it was good the falafel had a good flavor to it i liked it a lot id be happy to come back love the diablo pita great portions i recommend the greek salad or rice as a side this will become a regular stop for me its pretty good the seating dining area could use a little enhancement but the food is about right for the price good falafel amazing greek food and the employees are always super friendly and helpful greekumbers are my fave best gyro ever we drive out of our way to come eat here and weve never been disappointed always good portions fresh and clean i have had my share of a greek food and this is amazing fresh flavorful and affordable if you are in scottsdale you must check them out indoor and outdoor seating is a plus and its not loud inside at all had the greek chicken sandwich fries and salad i wish the fries where freshly cooked instead of out of a warmer id go back in the future not a bad lunch decent price sandwich was good salad just they way i like it my new go to greek spot i live walking distance away and im glad i finally checked this place out everyone was so friendly the place was clean and the food was amazing will come back for sure go there right now and get yourself mikas fries its an unbelievable concoction of fries with some sort of incredible greek balsamic dressing loaded with juicy delicious gyro meat the worlds best tzatziki sauce and feta cheese i almost ate to the point of throwing up because it was so good three of us went at pm saturday before valentines day we wanted a place that wouldnt be inundated with celebrants one that was a locally owned one and someplace we havent been before mikas greek fit the bill perfectly first impression just like so many yelp reviews it was hard to find i thought there was a mediterranean place on the west side of the plaza nope there was a pizza place that has a huge ad for gyros in the front window that was misleading the man there helped us when we asked where mikas was and he kindly pointed we will have to stop there for pizza sometime since he did help us find it mikas is on the south part of papago plaza next to the british pub second impression clean it was a crisp clean interior design and modern i really liked it next we were to order at the front counter and they would bring it to us a little awkward with one of us with a cane and having never been there but we were just new to the place next time will be easy peasy next wowowowow the food was great we ordered the greek sampler and my favorite part was the hummus tzatziki and pita very quickly after that our entrees arrived each of us had ordered pitas the chicken caesar pita was said to have really tender delicious chicken the original pita was yummy with extra tzatziki and the diablo pita was very much enjoyed by our friend the pitas come with a side our choices of rice and salad worked very well with our pitas desert was very very tempting but with having had the sampler before the meal we look forward to having the honey walnut baklava another time i would highly recommend going love this place tucked away and hidden in papago plaza by a barber shop it is worth finding this gem love the greek food not greasy at all and tastes delicious very health conscious here and the restaurant is clean and cute i loved this little greek place definitely off the beaten path but clean modern and the food was delicious i had the gyro platter with fries and shared a baklava for dessert the gyro was a bit different than i expected pita triangles served alongside the meat and toppings instead of a pre made gyro but so delicious that i ate more than i should have baklava is not my favorite but this version was great ill definitely be back this very nice fast casual restaurant is clean cool and very delicious some of the best greek food that i have ever had better than what ive had in greece do yourself a favor and give this place a try you wont be sorry well i have only been here once and i liked it very much my friend alan had been here quite a few times so i thought i would give it a try it is located in a shopping center on the south west side of scottsdale road if that makes it easier to find it very simple inside which is really all it needs to be we ate outside because it was a beautiful day not too hot yet we ordered our food and then took a seat outside intending to go back in to collect our plates one of the ladies was nice enough to bring it out to us i got the gyro and lentil soup i only got the soup because alan said he really liked it i really liked it as well very good as well as very healthy i did not get the fries because other reviews said they were cold many times i instead got the humus which was really good and tasted very fresh i took a photo of alans meal his was wonderful as well i want to go back again and check it out some more the one thing that was a bummer no hot drinks such as hot teas nothing special here just food that is quick cheap and good stopped by after work to grab a quick dinner well spent had the greek beef night club souvlaki with lentin soup food was pretty decent have had better for the price the lady at the cash register was friendly and there is a bench by the entrance setup specifically for to go patrons i may give this place another chance next time i am in scottsdale greek food is on the top of my list so i can be a bit critical with that said this place is incredible service is always great and the food even better authentic high quality greek food try the picado pita or the greeks fries def wont be disappointed this is a new find for us we really like it the food is good really fresh the soup they serve is amazing a type of yellow lentil soup hummus is a big yes very good as well i would come here whenever i could you can eat inside or outside good prices and good food easy to get to as well right in the shopping center on the south west corner of scottsdale road and mcdowell im crazy for mikas greek so far i have had the caesar and the diablo caesar pitas they are both so yummy the pita bread always tastes so fresh with grilled chicken that is seasoned just so for sides i have had the rice and also paid a bit more for the greek fries which are topped with chunks of feta and drizzled with a vinaigrette which they put on the side for to orders so they dont get soggy in the bag smart they are so tasty and different then basicbitchfries ive been telling all my friends to go for awhile now so needed to write a review to tell the yelpians to go met a gf here for lunch what a delight the place smelled like fresh cut cucumber you order in line and then sit they bring the food out to you i ordered a hummus duo and greek salad the hummus was delicious the salad was fresh and perfectly zesty the restaurant quickly filled up and i realized that many people already know about this gem in south scottsdale ill be back so i traveled out of town and was craving for greek food i was in luck that there was a greek restaurant near me i checked the place out and its a very clean and quiet establishment i ordered their large platter just to fill my hunger from the order i had the chicken souvlaki and gyro meat with a side of rice and salad it also came with pita bread and veggies very delicious and filled me up i also bought their jalapeno hummus which was very good they have a coke dispensing machine that dispenses a variety of drinks from your usual sugary beverages to low calorie i liked the place so much that i came back again after my run i definitely recommend it people are also friendly so thats a plus so good i think i have a new favorite greek restaurant tried a chicken pita and greek fries both were delicious ill definitely be back my wife is greek i love greek food she is hyper critical of any greek fod beyond her own or her mothers so i dont get to eat it very often unless she cooks it i finally convinced her to try this place granted its fast greek and some items on the menu are middle eastern not really greek but thats ok the tzaziki a true measure of any greek food was surprisingly good i was also impressed with the dolmades the veggie gyro though needed a bit more feta to make the taste more authentic overall a good experience for greek food there are plenty of options for all palates including a kids menu i just picked up an order for the first time this is by far the best gyro i have had nice place very modern and clean everyone seems very friendly prices are reasonable i wouldnt say i ever crave their food but its basic mediterranean selection never had anything bad here though been here multiple times and i will keep returning like it better than the other greekmediterranean restaurants in the neighborhood theyre fairly quick too good gyros and greek salad this place was soon good i thought no place would make a better gyro the pita jungle so glad to see i was wrong it may be a little tucked away but once you find it you will be glad that you did the lady at the counter was so nice and informative and on a plus didnt try to shave information at us or try to over sell something extremely clean and professional along with great tasting food i didnt know i liked greek food until i ate here also do not let the outside persuade you since it looks very old from the sun the inside is entirely new and modern i highly recommend giving it a try oohhh i usually order a greek night club pita with chicken but upon feeling indecisive and learning that mikas has online ordering one of the meat choices listed was chicken gyro um yes please they had all sorts of options that you can customize with a simple click of a button white or wheat pita no onions extra sauce cut in half etc boom done it even gave me a pick up time and i received text notifications when my order was in process and ready for pick up having already paid online i just walked in was handed my bag and went on my way the whole process was very simple convenient and fast plus i didnt have to mispronounce gyro over the phone hahaha score my pita was excellent stuffed full of gyro chicken lettuce tomato onions kalamata olives tzatziki and feta mmm it was a little on the salty side which i actually like but just something to consider if youre sensitive to that sort of thing the side greek salad was also very good one of these days ill get around to trying the lentil soup all in all you can get a great fast filling meal here for less than that you feel about eating win ive walked past this many times during my treks from mcfate brewing to papago brewing its always looked neat and clean so i decided to give them a try this week for lunch they have the usual assortment of greekmediterranean menu items i went with a gyro with half gyro meat and half chicken with a side greek salad i also had an iced tea and i have to say that their iced tea is particularly good the food itself was excellent plenty of meat and good tzatziki sauce they even take the pits out of the olives on the salad this place is neat as a pin the food is good and the service is fast and friendly eat here all the time great food and great managementowners not sure whos working tonight but when i ordered rice her excuse was were closing no more rice its you dont close for minutes i drove min to get late night carbs great place but being minutes from closing isnt an excuse for the most important part of my meal i found this place on yelp and i am so happy i did i live right down the street and order takeout from mikas pretty regularly i cant say enough about the food it always tastes fresh and healthy i love to get the greekpeno pita with jalapeno hummus and chicken the falafel here is also amazing everyone i have taken here has enjoyed the food best part is that its huge portions for a small pric}
{736, Castle Tavern, 3160 Library Rd Pittsburgh PA 15234, its a bit of a dive but the dining room is kid friendly they have a good selection of beer and the food is excellent a typical tavern with a basic bar menu of burgers sandwiches and fried munchies the deep fried jalapeno pretzel is a great change from the usual fries or cheese sticks i usually order the fried fish sandwich which is a great size and filling service is okay casual and prompt the main dining area away from the bar is nice and quiet full of pittsburgh sports memorabilia not a bad place to look around while waiting for your order love their witty signs they put up to get you thinking as you drive down rt which seems to be a never ending construction zone ordered chicken wings they looked very unappetizing especially after i picked one up and it had feathers coming out of it i understand things happen but the situation was handled very unprofessionally im not sure if our server was embarrassed but it seemed as though we were avoided after the issue was brought to her attention}

{51195, Asian Island, 14870 N Northsight Blvd Ste 103 Scottsdale AZ 85260, fast fresh perfect and that was just the food the service was excellent as well im very picky about my fast food chinese and dont normally comment but this was worth it the girl friend said the hawaiian was really good too this place is awesome on all accounts i went there today with my wife for lunch and we were both very pleased they have a good sized menu with a lot different styles of food i had the general tsos chicken and my wife the curry chicken both were great and reasonably priced it was less then for the both of us the service was also excellent not only are the staff very friendly but we had our food in less than ten minutes i will be going there again maybe tomorrow stars just finished putting away leftovers from a take out order i placed via phone six minutes before closing time mom was hungry so i asked would you like some pizza or chinese she said chinese and as i started to look for the flos menu i had in my purse she mentioned the pamphlet we received in the mail from asian island while she pored over the menu i checked for yelp reviews and found only one of significance by that i mean those reviews written by elites real photos and names that of scott d s mom gave up looking disgusted at seeing the high prices what do you mean the foods expensive i asked i looked at the menu and i didnt see anything over the top chicken beef and pork shrimp so i decided id go w scott d s wifes selection of shrimp lo mein for mom and the twice cooked pork for me id requested that they omit carrots celery and if any corn and mushroom the woman on the phone repeated these veggies twice so i gathered that she was taking careful notes the food was very tasty mom said the shrimp dish was good i asked good good or good because youre hungry good she said good good but not out of body experience good to quote scott d lol my twice cooked pork bbq pork sauteed w carrots bell pepper water chestnuts spring onions celery and onions among other things was also very tasty mom liked the dish as well but when asked preferred the shrimp i had also requested a side of egg noodles loved the bean sprouts instead of rice and i really appreciated that they obliged other restaurants wouldve forced me to take rice which i cannot have and then make me pay for a side order of noodles this alone deserved a star easily stars which isnt bad for my first take out meal from here and id have given stars if my request for certain veggies to be omitted was followed i will return to try other items and hopefully theyll be more mindful about my food allergy concerns lunch options look tantalizing and sushi and hawaiian dishes are also available have eaten here twice in two weeks first time we hade take out and it was great keep in mind that nothing beats fresh out of the kitchen but it was great take out liked it so much we went back to eat at the restaurant and loved the food even mire as it was served hot out of the kitchen and delicious the quality was top notch white meat chicken only high quality beef and super fresh veggies cooked perfectly we have tried the mongolian beef szechuan beef orange chicken dumplings etc and all were top notch this food blows away any established asian place we have tried like jade palace the only thing this place lacks is atmosphere as it is mire of a fast food type of atmosphere but the food is first rate tasty and fresh a small family establishment just getting started and doing it all right lets make sure these guys stay in business as scottsdale needs this quality of chinese food at the affordable prices they offer loved it going back for more we love this place the sushi is very good the staff is very friendly we try to go every week like the hawaii fried rice lots of shrimp lots of pictures of the food so you can see what youre getting a real neighborhood feel my wife wanted the berry roll and they were out of berries they offered to go get some next time we came she remembered and told us she had berries today it was very good asian island has become my favorite take out place they have chinese sushi and hawaiian bbq so if im in the mood for sushi and my husband wants fried rice were both happy the food is really good with very fresh ingredients the restaurant itself is nicely decorated very clean and the people who work here are friendly nice and helpful we try to go once a week for my sushi fix just had dinner there wa big group adults kids our bill came out to for plates of sushi large size entrees orange chicken veggie lo mein house lo mein veggie garlic chix mongolian beef hawaiian fried rice what a great deal everything was great even had some left overs located near the scdl gun club give this place a try if i could give a place stars that would be this restaurant you know those times when you want take out and you want chinese food but you could be swayed towards sushi or even maybe even hawaiian go to this place and just stare are the many menu boards its all good ive had their sushi tiger roll is my current favorite here their chinese combo lunch plates which are outrageously cheap and their fried fish hawaiian combos everything has been great and way more food than i can eat their service is great as well they bring the food to your table if you are eating in and start you off with crispy wonton strips and sweet sour sauce then your food comes fresh from their grill and it is just wonderful they even offer to top off your drinks for you and bring you anything else you need you could come here for lunch every day try something new and never run out of choices or variety on top of that their hours are amazing something like am to pm early lunches to late dinners and they deliver i cant think of anything to complain about maybe they could offer soup really thats my wish not even a complaint because i probably could not eat wontons soup and a dish but i would try update they do have soup its not on their big boards but is listed on their small takeout menus so there you have it its all good i finally tried this place today after a bad experience at ono i wanted to give hawaiian another chance however when i waked in here today i ordered the orange chicken on auto pilot why i really dont know it was decent but likely the lamest dish i could have ordered the staff seems to be on the ball and the place is really clean so i intend to return and fully explore the hawaiian menu when i think of asian island many things come to mind delicious and i mean everything fresh ingredients that are prepared to order great service many menu options forever as in it takes forever to get your food here if you are in a pinch and need lunch quickly call ahead or plan to take your meal to go this kind of deliciousness doesnt happen fast dine in customers and often customers waiting for takeout orders are treated to crispy wonton strips and dipping sauce to prevent them from eating one another during the extended wait for food but fret not my friend for once the goods are placed before you you cant help but forget the agony you endured waiting for it this is top notch fast casual dining sadly i have to deduct a star for the slow food service if they can get moving in the kitchen and start turning tables over a bit more quickly theyd have no trouble getting a five star rating out of me i cant believe im recommending a place that serves chinese hawaiian and sushi and im still having a hard time to believe i summoned the courage to try the place i would usually turn tail and run but i trusted my fellow yelpers and gave it a shot they were spot on there were six in our group adults kids and everyones dish was legit and a great portion for the price im still thinking about the mongolian chicken i ordered wow asian island im so glad i dont need a boat to get to you cuz im coming back weve eaten here quite a few times and i must say this is the best chinese we have had here yet i planned to try different things each time but i cant get past the kung pao tofu it is absolutely awesome fresh veggies pepper onion carrot baby corn celery firm tofu and a delicious spicy sauce that has become one with the tofu and will be quickly absorbed in their nice sticky rice the peanuts put this dish over the top husband has tried the sweet sour chicken hawaii fried rice general tso chicken crunchy shrimp tempura roll and the crab puffs he had rave reviews for the tempura roll and thought the other dishes were great as well youve got to love a family run place where the youngest kid is sitting up front doing his homework under the watchful eye of everyone working there excellent food at a reasonable price with great service another yelp recommendation that was completely on target i found this place through yelp yesterday and ordered some delivery while i was working at home this place wasnt amazing but its pretty good for american chinese food and i will def be ordering again the menu is really varied which is awesome and they include all of your standard traditional favorites the delivery was fast about minutes the only downside was the lady who answered the phone could barely speak english and had a really hard time understanding me on my phone number address and credit card info but it was totally worth it i ordered the sweet and sour chicken spring rolls and steamed rice all yummy they even put the sweet and sour sauce in a seperate container which i love because it gives you control over how much sauce you want hey sometimes i just want the chicken without the sauce and is great for leftovers there is no other good chinese food delivery in the area a great find try it you probably wont be disappointed or greatly impressed this is a typical americanize version of jack of all trades hawaiian chinese and japanese food all in one place went here for local yelp get together wife had a chinese food and i tried the japanese food sushi if you come here for the sushi skip if you come here for a quick chinese food this one will be fine i wouldnt call it authentic chinese food though its more like your typical chinese fast food your local mall searching yelp for a locally owned place to eat lunch in this area and the asian island popped up hawaiian and chinese cuisine with sushi prepared and served restaurant style but in a place that looks somewhat like a new dinnerfast food ish i had their kung pao two with chicken and shrimp the portion was large and it was delish the fried rice was a little dry but still tasty my friend had the hawaiian seafood mix with fried shrimp and bbq short ribs with a side of rice he really enjoyed his meal the hawaiian bbq short ribs were his fave he gnawed on the bones the service is very friendly and eager to please if youre in the area looking for a great lunch the asian island is a solid place to go tried the mini version of coconut shrimp wife loved it i had kung pao two lot of food spiced just right service friendly try it for lunch those who desire home delivery beware after hours and several phone calls regarding status we finally gave up and called to cancel the delivery we were told it would have taken yet another minutes we have eaten here numerous times and this is too bad the food is decent but the home delivery is not at all reliable if seeking delivery move on to a different restaurant im born and raised from hawaii and this did not taste like anything back home i asked the owner if they are from hawaii and they said no they havent been there that was sooo disappointing i wont go back the service sucked too i havent tried their sushi or hawaiian selections yet but this is a great place for your stereotypical chinese food i live close by so i can utilize their delivery service and they are always speedy im to the point of obsession with their shrimp snow pea when i think back to my past lunches at asian island the first word that comes to mind is value the second word would be kuaisu which is chinese for this was a good meal that didnt take long and they have a soda fountain with free refills and each table has a bottle of sriracha which is also pretty cool we have been looking for a good asian style restaurant that fit our needs since we have moved to az we heard about asian island through a friend and we decided to try it the not only had all our favorites but the prices were reasonable and all the food was very fresh everyone was very friendly and the overall atmosphere was very comfortable i would recommend this to anyone who loves asian food i will definitely eat at asian island again great plate lunch stopped by for the first time tonight and had the bbq beef plate lunch it was right on target sticky white rice mac salad sweet thinly sliced beef it was a very filling meal and tasted great nice prices in the place too i will certainly be heading back i eat there four or five times each week i love the chinese food the best but my wife like the sushi as well today i had the hawaiian bbq pork the flavor was delicious the restaurant is family owned with fast tasty home style food and friendly service the portions are large with fair prices i have tried most everything on the menu and i enjoyed every meal you cant go wrong eating there i highly recommend asian island welcome to asian island home of some of the best chinese take out in tucson uh i mean home of some of the really good chinese take out in phoenix for seven months i have been deprived of fan worthy chinese food good grief t town should come with a disclaimer the city of tucson lacks and star chinese restaurants ive been hunting around for a while now and then on my first attempt at chinese in phoenix i experience a victory of sorts for americanized chinese food this place is good they have dinner combos with a super portioned dish a spring roll and two crab cakes i especially appreciate asian islands transparent kitchen wall which allows guests to peek in while the cooks do their thang so get on in there and watch how they fry all their shtuff fresh and inexpensive my family orders delivery from asian island every few weeks its so convenient and no extra charge and we love the pan fried pot stickers and mongolian beef the rice is nice and sticky just the way i like it the price is right too this is definitely our favorite traditional chinese place we havent ventured beyond the chinese food menu to try the sushi to be honest the price for the food is a lot lower than the same dish in pfchang an other fancy restaurants near by the taste of the food is a lot better than the ones in pfchang so less price and better food why not treat yourself with some good stuff in asian island i love the black pepper beef a lot i can eat it everyday for this dish the bbq short ribs is awesome as well i just love it so much the owner told me that they have been looking for a cashier to cover the phone as well for lunch time but they have not found this helper yet so they are super busy during lunch time anyway stop by one day and try it out you will love the food over there i was a little early for a trauma first aid class at nearby scottsdale gun club saw this restaurant a few doors down and stopped in for a quick meal was in a bit of a hurry so ordered something fairly safe sweet and sour pork the test of a good italian restaurant is their bolognese sauce if they dont offer it or it tastes canned dont bother with anything else they offer fried rice is the real test of a good oriental restaurant get that right and everything else is also probably good asian island makes great fried rice it has that background smoky flavor that says the cooks know what they are doing the sweet and sour pork was good along with the spring roll and crab rangoon much better quality than i was expecting asian island just went to the top of my where to eat list when i visit scottsdale gun club really good had beef fried rice and coconut shrimp both really tasty and reasonably priced very friendly service for take out i seriously love this place their always so friendly and the food portions are huge more than enough to split is you want its so cheap and so good and they deliver what more could you as for really hard for me to rate this place i was a bit apprehensions going in for sushi as its kind of a small hole in the wall place that has serves everything plus some sushi my experience has taught me to avoid such places nonetheless i gave it a go and ordered about worth of susi the place was absolutely empty and it took about mins to make the rolls i ordered the place was clean and simple its more someplace id run in to get a quick rice bowl versus having dinner the folks that were working there were very kind and brought us won tons and sauce while we waited and offered us a soda nice touch the sushi was ok it wasnt bad but it wasnt necessarily very tasty either it just was had it not been for the nice service id probably give stars but as the saying goes kill em with kindness chicken katsu was terrible it was extremely fatty and tough i called an hour ahead for take out and my order was ready when i picked it up the kung pao chicken was delicious with a little kick to it my kid loved the mongolian beef which was a generous serving it came with a side of rice and all for it easily fed people i have been coming here regularly and have never been disappointed the husband and wife who own the place are always smiling and happy to see customers ive had meals here and food taste great prices are god and if you go for lunch you should get the combo try their garlic shrimp and teriyaki chicken as well as the hot sour soup sushi is good too and at very reasonable price my daughter loves their mango smoothies tried the mini version of coconut shrimp wife loved it i had kung pao two lot of food spiced just right service friendly try it for lunch went again had kung pao veggies for lunch friendly staff do it yelpers you were right again had the combination dinner of mongolian beef fried rice spring roll wontons everything was delicious and although the fried rice was meatless it was flavorful some of the best fried rice ive had in the valley hubby had the egg drop soup which i thought was absolutely delicious but he thought it was a little salty but what does he know he did like the flavor but you know always a complaint he had the orange chicken with brown rice which he liked especially because the crust was not heavy and they spiced it up the way he likes it prices are very reasonable service was attentive since it was a rainy day and we were the only ones there their delivery business seemed brisk although not to my area ill have to drive there to pick up my orders but i tell you it will be very much worth it i definitely will be back thanks to yelpers who give credit where credit is due terrific lunch specials super friendly staff and the food is awesome one of those places that you can get a great meal and feel good about patronizing a local family run restaurant ordered mongolian beef good flavor but was overloaded with onions and not enough protein prices are fair its decent but nothing special this is a good restaurant to go if you work near the area and you are in the mood for some cheap chinese food the plates are cheap and the quality is what you pay for as long as you dont go expecting amazing chinese food for bucks youll enjoy the place the people working here have always been friendly when ive gone love this place great food nice people so fare everything has been very good this food here is pretty good i give it stars because i have had better chinese food in other cities but for phoenix which lacks quality chinese food in general it is actually quite good the fried rice is ok could be better more fried it tends to be a bit more on the steamed side the mongolian beef is good but its not searedcrispy the way i like it the flavor is still very good though the lo mein is quite good as well the fried spring rolls that come with the lunch specials leave a little bit to be desired overall i do enjoy the food here very much for phoenix it is quite good prices are reasonable as well i recommend it wonderful mom and pop pan asian place came here to treat myself to comfort food after finishing a skating competition i opted for the mongolian beef combo plate given the stellar reviews on yelp the beef was nice and tender not gristly at all nicely seasoned and had a hint of spice the fried rice was good as well the egg rolls were crunchy and warm perfect meal to make one happy price very very decent holy crap this place is amazing the food is super fresh out of the kitchen so i highly recommend eating in the restaurant rather than getting take out theyve got some awesome hot mustard sauce too we decided to try asian island because of all the nice reviews it got this is a little mom and pop place that reminds of those little shops in sf chinatown we decided to eat there and they started us off with fried won ton strips with sweet and sour dipping sauce won ton was stale i ordered the pan fried noodles and my wife ordered the hawaiian bbq chicken the bbq chicken seemed like it was marinated over night and was very juicy and tender the noodles was pretty good and had shrimp chicken and a bunch of veggies i thought the food was good and ive tasted better thats closer to us so well see if we visit again surprisingly good place its kind of tucked away in a strip mall area but the food and service are great weve gotten take out and delivery theyll deliver within miles of their location near frank lloyd wright and the with several different dishes and each dish was good to great the prices are very reasonable ive been searching for a really good dive chinese restaurant in scottsdale since i moved here years ago and ive finally found it gross gross gross i yelped this place before going to lunch there with a coworker we decided to heed the warnings from a few bad reviews because there were more people saying good things about it needless to say it was a big mistake i ordered sweet and sour pork it came with pineapple the pineapple was fermented it was like i was chomping on alcohol cubes thats how old it was fried rice is a major letdown i also tried ordering wonton soup the menu says it is for a small bowl so i asked her how much extra it would be for them to add noodles she said that thats not possible for them to do and that i would have to purchase the noodle soup and pay an extra for them to add wontons does that even make sense dont go save your money and go to pei wei or any neighboring restaurant if youre in the mood for chinese this place will disappoint youd be better off going to an all you can eat chinese buffet and paying the same price for the same quality of food at least at those gross buffets you get to eat more than once wow we will be back for take out we wanted to try a new chinese restaurant in scottsdale for take out today what a pleasant surprise the service was great delivery was a fast minutes the food was really good and hot the order was perfect the portions were large and generous all around value was terrific next time we will try the sushi the reviews look really good ohhhh we like old school chow mein and could have been further delighted with hard crunchy noodles we eat frequently at jade palace narai thia and big eye sushi jade palace has great egg foo narai has really hot hot red chili paste for their awesome lunch specials large large portions and big eye service is excellent and has a huge spicy shrimp dish that is presented like a volcano heavenly creation i ordered general tsos chicken i was served sweet and sour chicken extremely sweet with green peppers onions and carrots i asked one of the servers after i tasted a few bites is this general tsos chicken was told by the woman behind the counter that it was just with spices i did not taste any heat and it was not a tso sauce my belief was that the kitchen made a mistake and no one dealt with it if this was tsos chicken then the chef needs to check some recipes for the dish directions in a bowl whisk together egg white tablespoons cornstarch tablespoons rice wine tablespoon soy sauce add chicken and toss to coat cover and marinate in the refrigerator up to hours recipe sauce tablespoons dark soy sauce tablespoon rice vinegar teaspoons chinese rice wine or dry sherry tablespoon granulated sugar tablespoons chicken broth or water tablespoon minced ginger teaspoons minced garlic teaspoons cornstarch for thickening sauce optional recipe sauce tbsp

onions stir fry seconds add chicken stock sauce boil until the sauce thickens arrange the chicken on a platter and pour the sauce over it sprinkle with chopped green onions serve with hot rice i wasnt wild about this place but it was perfectly okay its kinda a generic asian restaurant that does not specialize in any one thing in particular more asian than island super good the price is more than fair most of the stuff are yummy and my favorite dishes are beef with black pepper singapore rice noodle dry fried rice noodle beef chao fun and hawaii bbq beer orand short ribs dumpling is awesome too wow do not miss the hot and sour soup my buddha house fried rice is amazing too so many cant type them all here and the people work in this restaurant is super kind and nice it is absolutely worthy to stop by and check it out it is right by the scottsdale gun club easy to find came here for dinner with the family and this place was great i ordered the lemon chicken and was very pleased with the food and the potion size the price was great too the woman and the man who work here are very very friendly i would come back regularly if i lived in arizona grabbed a burger yes a burger p and some spring rolls for lunch was pretty delish the burger was super tasty and a great price and the spring rolls yummy too the gal working the counter was friendly and quick so i was in and out of there in a matter of minutes they dont always have a great english speaker but its really all about the food anyways amirigh the only eh part about lunch was the duck sauce they provide it was a little too thick and color and consistency were not attractive seemed like very cheap sauce look forward to my next meal there minus the duck sauce p friendly staff and solid chinesehawaiian food bland lacking spice garlic ginger you know the ingredients that make you crave chinese food this is typical valley chinese i wouldnt bother coming here on my own timedollar cant speak to the hawaiian dishes asian island is one of my favorite places for chinese food in the valley although ive never actually eaten in the restaurant the take out is always great it is one of the few places ive not only found happy family on the menu but it also tastes spot on the kung poa chicken and fried dumplings are really yummy too i normally grab a bag of wonton chips with each order as well when i order take out its always quick easy and ready when i get there the family that runs the restaurant are always very nice and friendly as well i highly recommend its not often i venture away from my desk for lunch during the week without having to bring it back and eat all alone so i was quite excited to actually get a lunch break since other yelpers keep checking in here i thought id give it a shot the place is nothing spectacular to look but the service was great and the food was good what i was in the mood for wasnt on the menu so in a hurry i just spit out general tsos chicken please after we ordered and paid i walked away wondering how they will get the food to me since i didnt give them a name and they didnt give me an order number oh well theyll find us i hope we took a seat outside and waited about minutes before some lady brought our food right to us with wonton chips for free for no drinks for two i was happy im not in a hurry to get back here but they met all my expectations and ill add it to my list of places to eat when im craving asian food in north scottsdale i have eaten here many times and i love the food my favorite dish is kung pow chicken and i also get the spicy tuna roll i would recommend this place to anyone schezwan chicken i ordered was boring and not very good too bland wont be coming back whenever im having a night where i just want delivery instead of going out this is my immediate go to they have a really big menu and for the price you get a lot of food the drivers are always very friendly also good chinese delivery for a great price got a burger with spring rolls for lunch on monday spent all monday evening being sick and am still recovering from food poisoning i am not a happy camper i ordered from this place after being mistreated by some rude young ladies at jade palace when i placed my order the staff were friendly and helpful the delivery came in almost exactly minutes which i appreciated since we were hungry first the spring rolls they were awesome i wish that i wouldve ordered more and for only you definitely should next i ordered the kung pao tofu the tofu was not as firm as i wouldve liked it and i wouldve preferred some other veggies but overall a solid dish my husband got the curry shrimp and said it was quite tasty as well we also ordered some veggie fried rice perfectly cooked with big bold veggies delish the portions were very generous we will have plenty of leftovers and all to your door for i love it and we will definitely be back side note comparable meals at jade palace was woah excellent good quality chinese large delivery area i will definitely be ordering again this place is awesome i always order here when i get the chance i think my favorite has to be the sweet and sour pork and the mongolian beef wait i changed my mind the katsu chicken and teriyaki chicken was amazing yep those are my favorites haha the portions are good it does taste more authentic than some of the chinese places around the area and the fact that its chinese people that own the place kind of confirms it good place for lunch they also have some korean and japanese and hawaiian style food here too just moved to sdale from the n valley and after reading the recent yelp reviews for this place and the star overall rating i thought i would try it for delivery took about hour to get the food and wasnt impressed at all blah moo goo gai pan and my roomie didnt like his chicken lo mein much either hot and sour soup was so so as well i did like the fried wontons they give you for free thin and crisp unlike most chinese restaurants throwing the delivery menu in the trash and wont be ordering from them again i dont think ill go back first prob the bathroom yuck it wasnt clean there was trash on the floor the hot water didnt work and there was minimal water coming from the cold side makes one wonder how clean the kitchen is second prob the food wasnt awesome being from the islands i was expecting more than what i got granted there are people out there who think im mexican which is no biggy but when they serve food thats sub par because they assume i dont know my food well thats when i get a bit offended went there with my mom she had the mini loco moco family fave yet the eggs came out way too runny like not even close to being cooked i ordered the seafood mix with the short ribs both plates came with bland mac salad and old rice believe me i know the dif between fresh cooked rice and day old rice for pupus we ordered the chicken musubi the chicken was good but the rice brought the whole dish down to blah im taking a leap here but im guessing the fish and shrimp were frozen what i did like was the short ribs too bad the butter knife couldnt cut through for smaller bites im all for using my hands when eating but come on you usually cut the meat off then finish the bones as for the eggs the lady was a little angry but took the plate back and came back with much better looking eggs cool thing the cook came back to make sure the eggs were okay they were good luck when eating here i usually give a restaurant a couple chances in case there was an off day but im not sure ill be doing that here the kids were cute and were helping out but that doesnt cut it when the food is sub par and the bathroom is dirty food was great it came out very quickly and it was hot and fresh it was typical chinese food nothing really special but we still loved what we ate i had kung pao chickenshrimp the others at my table ate mongolian beef and the happy family all the meals includes fried rice crab puffs and a spring roll this place gives great service the food was good and the price was decent new to phoenix area and already went here twice the fried rice is really good and the spring rolls are amazing between me and my girlfriend trying different dishes we have yet to have a bad dish all of the ones we have tried have been prepared well not greasy like some places and more important very delicious and they give you a lot of food for the price too this place is one of my new favorites for lunch here in the airpark and ive tried just about everything this is a small family run asian fusion type joint its the kind of place where you shouldnt be surprised if you see their young daughters hanging out and chatting up the customers theyre super cute the one time i saw them im giving them stars because they can whip you up a quality lunch for under theres a whole list of options over rice for posted outside on the inside they have even more lunch specials ranging from and these things come with fried rice and choice of spring rolls or crab puffs its really a heck of a deal for an quick and satisfying lunch finally a decent and normally priced chinese food place in the area and they deliver wheeeeee for those of us trapped at the office that means a lot this and having such great lunch specials i get the curry chicken with brown rice and its delicious definitely will use them again great food and adorable prices highly recommend if youre looking not to spend too much on chinese great find this place is fast very reasonably priced and tasty i love hawaiian fare and this place has the classics i had the fried shrimp with of course white rice and macaroni salad the shrimp breading had a nice crunchy texture and the macaroni salad was fresh and had the right amount of mayonnaise my husband tried the vegetable roll i love sushi and am always on the look out for good sushi i thought the roll was great especially for the price the ingredients were all thinly and neatly chopped and looked fresh the rice to vinegar ratio was good not too tangy we also tried tofu vegetable dish my husband spent yrs in china and he said that dish is exactly the style of stir fry he loves again fresh veggies and the tofu is a fried tofu sauce was a light gravy not too strong and good amount of saltiness i can see why this place has stars high quality food for a really great price i didnt eat in but i ordered take out i think its pretty cool that they offer free delivery for and above pirchases i highly recommended it for multiple people who wants to order unless you have a huge appetite like me i believe the two people who answered the calls were the owners of the place they did take an hour for my food to come but it was my fault for putting in the wrong address to be honest they are very nice people cuz even if it was my fault putting the wrong address it seemed they took the fault and they gave me extra spam and bbq beef musubi from my order how generous so as great customer satisfaction i gave them stars cuz of that there food is average taste wise ive had better island food would i order again definitely prices are right customer satisfaction and i was happy with my order and extra order they provided lol i ordered my food online and it came about minutes later right about time the gentleman who delivered was so very sweet and the food is absolutely delicious food is great and the service is great just be mindful that it does take a little while to make i was having a bad night so i decided to order some hot and sour soup rent some movies and just stay in that night i looked online and the only place that had decent reviews was this place so i go to their menu and i ordered my hot and sour soup i had to order chicken fried rice and pot stickers also since my total had to be at least or something like that but thats okay i wasnt fretting it anyways i ended up not having to wait long until my food was at the door which was great i put the food on my table and open it all up and it smelled great now let me tell you i am a huge hot and sour soup fan and i know good soup from bad but this soup was hands down the best hot and sour soup i have ever had they even put shrimp in it the fried rice and pot stickers were just like any other restaurants the only negative thing i could say about this place was the fact that they gave me three fortune cookies and it was only me eating the food so it made me feel like a fatty and it made me feel lonely because i was supposed to be eating that meal with people or on the plus side i needed to open all three fortunes to find the good one and i now have a good fortune will definitely we returning for some more hot and sour soup i have been ordering from here for over a year now and never been disappointed great quality food excellent customer service and they have everything from sushi to authentic chinese and bbq this place is surprisingly good i say surprisingly because it does not look like much but the ffod and tge value is great i wouldnt say i loved this place but my experience was definitely positive my curry shrimp over rice meal was good and it would be quite difficult to beat the saturday lunch special price you could tell the family who owns the place was working very hard and that garnered my respect it was cool to see even their young daughter eagerly helping out and truly enjoying greeting guests and bringing out food the free chips with sweet and sour sauce while you wait were a nice small touch too my meal had more of a chicken broth flavor than a curry flavor which was unfortunate but there was a good amount of shrimp in the dish and i liked that the veggies were not way overcooked like many other asian restaurants overall pretty good food cant beat the price and a family business worth supporting i cant believe its been so long since my first review of ai here we are in and this remains my favorite spot for chinese food ive tried a bunch of other places in between and no one even comes close kung pao tofu is still awesome as is the mapo tofu veggie lo mein is so good and my husbands latest favorite is the shrimp chop suey there has been no drop off in quality or quantity the amount of food they give you is crazy and they always accommodate special requests the prices are beyond reasonable i bumped them up from my original stars to because now that ive tried the rest i appreciate this place so much more very disappointed in the food and service at this spot i walk and and the owner starts to scream at his worker who seems to be his wife he is screaming at her in mandarin so i cant tell what hes saying i order kung pao chicken and find two hairs in the food i also got a hot and sour soup that was way too salty and didnt taste right i was hesitant to eat the soup from the beginning as i heard the owner coughing while packaging the soup anyways there should be much better choices in scottsdale for chinese food manager told me to give half of my money back due to wrong order it never happened he should not lie called them directly and placed a delivery order to our hotel room food arrived in a timely manner and was delivered by a friendly driver i was immediately struck by the weight of our bags generous portions packed in excellent containers that did not leak still piping hot black pepper chicken was my favorite with juicy tender pieces of chicken and crisp vegetables in a delicious sauce with just the right amount of pepper kick i would not hesitate to order from this fine establishment the next time i am in town have had the lemon chicken twice now both delivery and it is great ordered thru grubhub and the food got here earlier than the estimated time which i appreciated i was really craving chinese food and it was pouring so i decided to order delivery i ordered the crab puffs egg drop soup and pork lo mein delivery time said min i ended up not receiving my food until an hour and minutes crab puffs were cold but luckily the soup and pork lo mein were piping hot on arrival asian island has good food and theyre always on time i have only ordered online delivery through yelp even though i live across the rd so my review is based on this alone everything i have ordered has been pretty good my favorites are the orange chicken almond or cashew chicken and crab puffs their sushi is pretty decent also i love the tiger rolls the highlight of this place is ordering delivery through yelp thats what makes this place stars for me its just so easy and convenient maybe too convenient ha on their take out menu there is an option of a free item with or or more which is nice although they have forgotten a couple of times to include overall i like the food love the convenience and i am happy with the service great chinese food i have only ordered online for delivery but everything i have had is good by quick chinese food standards the prices are very decent and the delivery is on time i am a big fan of the lo mein i eat here every week on friday for lunch never gets old it is so good genuine chinese restaurant so far all my meals have been fresh clean and delicious we ordered of food here through grub hub delivery we found coarse black hairs in the sweet and sour chicken cooked into it now we have a ton of leftover food we are afraid to eat the staff is friendly but i just cant do hair in my food i recently ate here i had the teriyaki chicken plate and it was delicious although the chicken was a little rubbery in taste other than that minor complaint the service was nice and the food was fast this is a little hidden gem in a mini mall parking lot their spam musubi is amazing and i embarrassingly think about it when im starving sometimes their ma po tofu bbq chicken and short ribs are also amazing i wish their staff was a little more friendly food is great this was one of those places that we tried mainly because of the high yelp ratings in this case i hate to say yelp was wrong we drove in for take out we decided to order at the store and wait for our food rather than call ahead the goal was hotter food by the time we got home the food came out quickly and was still quite warm once we got home i did not enjoy my meal boyfriend and i each ordered the dinner special choice of entree rice spring roll and crab wanton boyfriend ate his orange chicken but said he has most definitely had better my general tso chicken was very sub par mostly celery and onion chunks not much flavor although pretty good chicken pieces size wise and not dry it wasnt bad or inedible i just felt like it lacked spice and tang the spring roll was good crispy and not soggy or greasy crab wanton was good but tasted pre made fried from a frozen bulk bag my most disappointing item was my hot and sour soup i am a hs soup fiend this hot and sour was the worst one i have ever tasted by far i was very happy to see tofu mushroom seaweed and other chunks of goodness in there more often then not you get a lone chunk of tofu in your serving at other places so i was excited to taste it boy what a let down the flavor was non existant no hot no sour just like what i would imagine dirty mop water to taste like i tried about three bites stirring in between in hopes of magically mixing up some flavor but nope i didnt eat it beyond my taste i hate to throw out food but it was that bad maybe the empty store was a give away it was around on a weeknight should have been some one getting dinner but the only occupants were the employees working at tables doing various tasks i will give them one more chance in a few weeks i would like to try the hawaiian side of the menu but if it fails to impress then i wont be back boyfriend agreed there is no need to return and spend our hard earned money on sub par food just because its hot and in our price range i really dont see why so many high ratings i ordered asian island through grubhub for the first time tonight and will definitely order again the delivery fee was only which is very convenient the estimated time on the delivery was about an hour but the food actually came very quickly and only took about minutes the spicy tuna sushi roll was amazing and very fresh i also ordered the orange chicken dish because it was suggested as a favorite item and it was very good as well i thought i received everything i ordered then all of a sudden the very nice delivery man knocked on my door with a second order of the orange chicken dish because they gave me the half order when i ordered the full i had no idea it was the half order because it was so big but that was so nice of them to bring me a second dish you can tell they truly care about their customers i highly recommend the sushi they removed yelp delivery and last order wasnt up to par they forgot one of my items i ordered there it took minutes longer then expected the food was mediocre at best yelpers i am severely disappointed in this so called star place delivery does not make a place good if the food is ick it was unbelievable how amazing my oranch chicken and fried rice was to perfection i mean seriously she chef speaks no english so you know your getting genuine asian cuisine i come here about once a week and will keep coming thanks asian island you guys are the best i ordered asian island delivery for the first time tonight my boyfriend and i ordered the crunchy tempura shrimp rolls avocado salad wrap and wonton soup everything was exactly what we wanted and very good the delivery fee was only which was great and the delivery man was very nice i definitely recommend asian island good food this place is my go to for sushi delivery im allergic to shrimp and they always give me the shrimp spring roll with my choice of tuna or salmon and dont charge me extra very accommodating the staff couldnt be friendlier i love that they gave us a chinese calendar for the new year i have never been in the restaurant but ive been ordering from here for over two years and love it so cool that they have hawaiian options as well its like three restaurants in one chinese japanese and hawaiian awesome we found asian island pleasantly busy at lunch with good food and pleasant service the menu is extensive theres nothing fancy about it but its very good my wife had a veggie dish over brown rice i had delicious fried tofu and vegetables over brown rice this was the first time i have ever really enjoyed tofu so hats off to asian island we plan to go back for sushi and other things that sound good delivery service was good but the food wasnt great the fried orange chicken was soggy on the outside and the quality of the chicken seemed questionable rubbery and possibly past its prime kind of freaked me out so i lost my appetite and could not finish and felt i wasted my money ive ordered take out about four times over the last year from this restaurant and id say the food was good less than half my experiences too bad the spring rolls mixed vegetables fried rice egg drop soup panfried dumplins were great we would come again service was good nice to be able to get some hawaiian bbq stateside i like to the get the meat combo mix this comes with generous portions of hawaiian bbq chicken bbq beef and bbq short ribs along with rice and macaroni salad the meat is tasty and well cooked and the macaroni salad is ono the mac salad tends to be really bland at a lot of the stateside hawaiian bbq joints so thats a big plus for asian island stop by for lunch or dinner and get your aloha bbq on a colleague took me to lunch here and it is a solid star place offering both chinese and hawaiian food since you dont see hawaiian food very often i chose to go with that for lunch i got a combo plate of fried mahi mahi hawaiian barbecue chicken white rice and cabbage the star of the dish was the fried mahi mahi it was thick cut juicy and fried to perfection they could do a better job on the sides maybe offer a more colorful vegetable side to add variety to the dish completely lacks ambience no need to eat in and counter staff is a little bit gruff tried a side of their kimchi but it was way too fermented my friend remarked that may be because it does not get ordered that often and thus sits for long periods of time overall give it a try just get your meal to go and avoid the kimchi i am not sure if they are under new management but this place has changed since my first visit in good spot good food horrible service used grub hub to deliver and did not receive my order before hours after being placed discourage anyone from going to this restaurant or using grub hub horrible never ever been restaurant like this in usa its like their home cum restaurant they have small tv turned on nearby our table they have the portable fan on facing to themselves and ac was turned off so it was quite humid they have kept the doors open so housefly came in and tried to sit on our food yuck i then asked the to go box and packed the food and came outside and threw the food in the garbage i tried to grab the hot chilly sauce but saw the thin layer of dust so i didnt grab at all they were talking in chinese in a loud voice so it was very disturbing very disrespectful environment for customers food was just okay the singapore rice noodle has too much turmeric powder so it looked very yellowish sorry i dont usually write the bad reviews but this was way too much great food we love the orange chicken and everything else on the menu the delivery is fast and the people are nice great chinese place big portions the taste and the quality is really good great food ordering is quick easy good service to go ordering the time to get my food is the problem i dont mind waiting for mins but an hour or more is too long also the last two times ive ordered its been wrong super frustrating but theyve always given me credit or replaced my order we family of with a year old and year old grabbed some take out from here for a later dinner after a long day of travel we ordered spring rolls steamed dumplings katsu chicken mongolian beef and orange chicken all were very good which is a big compliment from us as we are asian food snobs i realized that i was most impressed with the katsu chicken mostly because it was a very simple and delicious panko fried chicken dish that lent itself to so much diversity that you could please almost anyone with that one dish ten year old being picky just let him eat it as chicken fingers fifteen year old being teen just let him eat it with some hot mustard dipping sauce hubby and i had it with a bit of the dumpling sauce yummy i would not say that anything we had was earth shattering but it did strike me as being dependably and consistently very good food stopped in for lunch not impressed food had some heat but not flavorful general tso with fried rice and normally a choice of spring roll or crab puff but already at noon out of spring rolls also watched two people after me get food and i had to remind them of my order ive never been a huge fan of asian take out until i stumbled upon asian island through grub hub in the past month weve already ordered times the food has been yummy and consistent each time huge portion sizes too very surprised also that after eating i dont have that omg i just ate a plateful of sodium feeling cantonese pan fried noodles seems to be the one i get every time crab puffs and sesame chicken are also winners and the sushi is good too it is definitely worth giving a try this is really good if you like cheap chinese take away it isnt gourmet and the dine in experience isnt the greatest but it is good value and if you need to pick something up after work then this is a good choice very average the people were nice but the food was average i had the mongolian beef and so did my friend broccoli was cooked perfectly the meat was a little too pounded out and fatty and had no real texture the sauce was missing flavor i think if they improved the sauce it would have been better and of course the meat i may try them one more time but likely will avoid ordered delivery for dinner one night and we were pretty happy the food arrived sooner than expected and it was hot we enjoyed the short ribs and spam masubi the orange chicken was ok a little bland i need more spice this will be our new go to place for quick yummy asian takeout first time i came here it was pretty empty not that its a bad thing the food actually came out better then today i came again except it was busier the food bbq beef came out oily and kind of gross they also mixed up my fathers order and gave it to someone else if you come when the restraint is empty you get better food and service i had take out from here yesterday the chicken was strange i had sesame chicken and it was surprisingly salty and had the flavor of worcestershire sauce in it it wasnt sweet it simply tasted odd i gave up after about a quarter of the meal i wont be going back love this place the spicy tuna hand rolls are bomb they deliver and its always correct and super fast so nice to get quality sushi delivered love it not very clean weird smell the staffowners lazing about at table at pm with kids running amok i asked for bbq beef combo after the woman at the register shouted something on very loud chinese at a man i guess her husband she said no just simply no not im sorry or were out of it or anything else just no i turned around and left i say no too avoi}
{46475, UNLV Student Health Center, 4505 S Maryland Pkwy University Las Vegas NV 89119, as a unlv student i am luckily entitled to discount health care on the unlv campus in the student rec and wellness center i dont have health insurance so when i do get sick it really sucks but this place is the one who gets to take care of me since i pay the student health fees every semester here is what they offer for those who do not know physical exams specialty services such as dermatology gynecology sports medicine and nutrition immunizations and vaccinations on site medical lab pharmacy services my allergies finally got the best of me as i was completely incapacitated during my final exam for my fitzgeraldhemingway class not fun getting a walk in appointment usually sucks but calling ahead and getting one is a piece of cake i made an appointment late in the afternoon since i had been here before check in was easy and i even got seen minutes before my scheduled appointment because i got there a bit early first you have someone to do the quick intake weight date of last lady time blood pressure temperature and this time since my eyes were insanely swollen i got to do an eye chart reading as well the doctor came in very quickly and asked me basic questions about my history with allergies then looked at my eyes and ears he said wow i wish i could take a picture of your eyes you are the epitome for allergy eyes thanks doc ill put that on my dating profile if the boyfriend decides to split with me yeesh all that aside he prescribed me four yes four medications for my severe allergies i needed them he did say however that my eye drops might be pricey so they could be optional there is no cost for doctors visits so i went around the corner to the pharmacy the pharmacists behind the counter were shocked how expensive the other things he wanted me to get with the exception of one item for the rest were priced at each so needless to say i am just suffering with my damn allergies but im taking the medication the only problem with filling this prescription was that it was after and their register was closed so i had to go back inside to check out but that was not an issue overall i do love unlvs health center they have always been extremely professional and helpful and really do try for the most part not to screw you over as far as pricing i have done testing and the like before and it is always quick and of low cost unlvs health care is so good that i have heard of a lot of people taking an audited credit class because it is cheaper than health insurance and you get to use the health center as much as youd like if and when i am sick this is the place to go nope this place has always had the absolute worst service ever one semester i went to get treated for this chest cold that turned out to be pre pneumonia after i got it checked out by a real doctor same thing happened to my suitmates gf she had it worse my advice is if you think it is worse than whatever it is they say it is go get a second opinion the student health center at unlv is a great place for all students to go when they are in need of basic clinical services or other things such as shots regular health checkups and basic questions regarding ones personal health being on student health insurance they are my primary choice in terms of health care but if i need a referral they are more then happy to provide me with one also in terms of lab work no need to go to quest diagnostics as they have their own lab facilities on site just schedule an appointment and head on in i am forever grateful to dr gaal and his careful and skilled treatment of my laceration this was no ordinary cut lets just say bad enough for clark county paramedics to say whoa thats bad when medical professionals in vegas tell me somethings bad i get concerned to say the least i declined an ambulance and managed to drive myself over to campus without passing out now i will say that at the front desk it was a bit absurd that the first question the lady at the front dryly asked me is am i registered for fall semester now that doesnt sound too horrible except when you consider the fact that my shirt and pants are all bloody and im bleeding through the patch i have on she then goes on to tell me but its still summer and ill have to pay for the health fee i point to my patch and reply this is bad yeah bucks is nothing compared to this if that werent enough to add insult to injury i was supposed to take a survey on a computer which included a question on whether i had felt depressed in the past week how apt in fact i think i was getting the downers right then i finally ask the receptionist to just be able to see somebody and i get to go to the second floor after the nurse took my weight blood pressure and temperature dr gaal examined me he advised me of my treatment options and clearly had experience in treating the injury i had he took the time and care to insure that any scarring would be minimal and made sure to keep everything clean in my wound he placed stitches which was no easy task he carefully explained to me what i would have to do at home and what precautions i would have to take on a subsequent check up he answered all my questions clearly and reasonably i quickly recovered and the wound area is looking pretty good i dont think i could have received better care anywhere in vegas nor at the low cost of student health center fee treatment co pay if you dont have student health insurance or any other coverage youre an idiot i have been an out of state student for the last four years and i have had the worst time trying to find doctors in vegas through the insurance companies however for small things and sometimes big things the unlv student health center as always been great i have had great dr s through out the years dr biazo who is not there anymore i think and now dr gaal who has been the best dr i have had in a long long long time he listens to me and he is willing to make sure he rules out all he can before just jumping to a conclusion that is what a dr should do care and listen with the intention to help no matter what i do not feel like a bother to him like i feel with others i have come in for colds allergies that took over my entire head and i honestly received great care the nurses are nice and the front office staff are nice even the pharmacy technicians are super nice the pharmacy is also pretty cheap at least it has been for me you have to call in the same day you want to go but i usually get an appointment when i want it but i call at exactly am when i know i need to go in if you call later you may or may not get in people tend to be sick all the dang time around here i have never had issues here other then maybe waiting for a long time once about a year ago but they do the best that they can and i appreciate this staff very much i am very happy with the service i receive at the student health center i have gone here many different times and have always had pleasant service the staff is friendly and the doctors are knowledgeable i personally see dr gaal and i think he is a really wonderful doctor he has really helped me with the migraines i have been having he took a personal investment in my health and made sure he helped me get better love going to the student health center its clean easy and the best part free if youre a studen}

{10977, Lunasea Salon+Day Spa, 99 S 10th St South Side Pittsburgh PA 15203, i love marla if i still lived in pittsburgh id definitely go to marla for every haircut i first learned of lunasea salon when i was a bridesmaid in my friends wedding we all went to the salon and marla was awesome she listened to my ideas and made excellent suggestions she also has an awesome sense of humor and kept me laughing the whole time after that experience i decided to book this salon for my own wedding this past may everything went perfectly im thinking about making an appointment for the next time that im in pittsburgh for a cut and coloring i believe that there are stylists working in the salon the salon also offers other services like waxing and makeup so definitely check it out do the people who run lunasea realize that when spoken aloud the name of their salon seems to be lunacy to me this is an almost insurmountable gaffe and yet i chose to have my hair cut here against my better judgment for a number of reasons of the three salons located equidistant from my house lunasea has the best curb appeal its small and independently owned ensuring a more personal experience the space is pleasant and well maintained without the unbearably pretentious atmosphere that ive experienced at so many high end salons even the cheesy abstract mural on the side of the building is charming in its way unfortunately the service at lunasea is simply not up to par that statement must be taken with a grain of salt since ive only dealt with one stylist leanne who i was scheduled with on my first visit and have been assigned to for all subsequent appointments reading some of the other reviews of lunasea it seems that other stylists may be more friendly and attentive however in a pleasant and unpretentious place leanne seems to have adopted the high end salon attitude although ive had appointments with her three times she never appears to remember me and cannot be bothered to call me by name or carry on a conversation i always go in with a positive attitude thinking that perhaps i just caught her on a bad day but despite my best efforts i have yet to have a truly positive experience as far as the haircuts themselves leannes work is fine but not fantastic the only time she makes the effort to speak is to chastize me for my dry split ends something entirely out of my control and the reason that im in the salon to begin with if i wanted my haircut with a lecture id have my mother trim the ends like she did when i was five the bottom line is that lunasea is cute and convenient

{42873, Dave's Barber Shop, 7110 E Thomas Rd Ste D Scottsdale AZ 85251, this is a great barber first off you wont see a sign that says daves barber shop in fact im not really sure why its called that seeing as how the woman behind the chair is named sherry but ive seen it called that in other reviews on other review sites google maps for instance so well stay with it but i digress i walked in on a saturday afternoon without an appointment even with only sherry cutting hair i still only waited about twenty minutes or so before being seen to not a tremendously busy place the afternoon i went in which is good the decor is vintage old school barber shop glass cabinet brushes etc this is not a hair salon this is an honest to god barber shop thank god they were in the midst of some renovations at the time so the place wasnt as organized as it might have been however it was still very pleasant to wait the chairs are rather worn but were still quite comfortable and they had an lcd tuned to the masters im not a golf fan but it was still very cathartic just sitting there sherry herself is very pleasant a middle aged woman who is still very attractive and a perfect balance between motherly and friendly she chatted with her customers and with some of the other people there a few other guys were there her husband a friend the mysterious dave i dont know but certainly regulars amicably the whole time never to where i felt like i was being forced to converse but never left in stony silence either as to the haircut itself phenomenal i went looking for a good barber after growing sick of the corporate chains i tried and received extremely sub par haircuts at and ive found it she asked for more input than ive been asked for even at hair stylists and when i expressed that i didnt know and essentially gave her free reign she did a wonderful job she even pulled out the straight razor for a few areas you will pay a bit more for it the costs ive had at chains was more like and this was children are less i think wasnt really paying attention to that however if you want a good haircut in a pleasant friendly establishment and se scottsdale is convenient for you this place is highly recommended i had been looking for a good barber shop in the area and this one fits the bill its run by one lady sherry if youre wondering its called daves barber shop because she bought it from dave and she decided to keep the name shes very friendly and shell give you a high quality hair cut shell take her time and make sure youre really satisfied with it she only accepts cash so be sure to bring some i showed up a little after on a week night its nice that shes open until during the week otherwise id have to come in on saturday since i work if youre looking for a quality hair cut and some nice conversation check out daves barber shop hesitate to say what a great barber she is because i dont want to share this hidden gem but sherry has earned the star rating sherry is the best barber in town i have gone to her for years and will not go anywhere else monday friday am pm saturday am pm mens regular seniors ages to children under cash or check only ive been going to dinos barber shop for years but they closed up and retired so i went looking in the neighborhood and found sherry at daves she bought the biz from dave and just kept the name i told her my head is in your hands look at it and cut it the way it should be cut the result is the best haircut ive had in years shes a happy person and loves what she does and is damned good at it thats good enough for me ps cash only been coming here for over years now sherry is hand downs the best barber ive had wont go anywhere else dont believe the hours posted arrived at pm on a friday and it was closed why close more than minutes early call me old fashioned but to me common human decency and even better some degree of customer empathy should still be a part of running a barber shop i showed up there at p this sat well within stated operating hours before i go on a little background ive been to this shop one time before that time i called the day before asking when they opened when i was told am i asked if i could make an appointment for the next day i start work at am she said just be the first one here that didnt seem very customer oriented plus i was a little turned off by a yelp review that talked about her strong political views but i figured that shouldnt matter if she was a good barber anyway i decided to give being the first one there one shot the next day as it turned out i was the first and only one there i got my haircut and listened to her one sided political views and personal problems so back to todays story when i showed up there was a customer in the chair and the barber was cutting his hair but the open neon sign wasnt lit i thought to myself maybe she just didnt turn the open light on it was a bright sunny afternoon when i got to the door though i noticed there was a closed sign on it ok maybe for some reason she was closing early that day but since my hand was practically on the door knob i decided to try it it was locked but the patron in the chair gave me a smile and put his hand up which i interpreted to mean just a minute mind you the last time i was at this shop the door was locked also when i tried it she explained being the only one there and an older woman she took extra safety precautions when the barber looked at me she also smiled and sort of waved then turned back to her customer now i wasnt sure if she was saying wait a minute but it certainly didnt look like sorry im closed so i stood at the door waiting i kinda assumed one way or the other she would come to the door to let me know what was going on mind you the two of them were no more than feet from the door when she didnt come to the door in the first minute or two i thought it was strange that she would have her next customer stand outside waiting but ive never seen more than two people customer and barber in the shop at a time so maybe that was just one of her safety precautions so i stood there for the or so minutes for her to complete the haircut she and her patron swept the floor and cleaned the chair before opening the door the first thing out of the patrons mouth as he sort of pushed his way past me was shes closing wtf they couldnt give me the common courtesy of letting me know she was closing theres nothing else near the storefront theres no other reason for me to be standing there in fact they did know exactly why i was standing there since that was the first thing out of their mouths i was livid obviously i will never go back there again i would have left a star rating because she doesnt seem to care about her customers but i admit she did give me a good haircut the first time around be aware she opens and closes when she feels like it not my idea of customer service}
{64180, Block & Grinder, 2935 Providence Rd Sherwood Forest Charlotte NC 28211, finally a place like this in charlotte they have combined a butcher shop and casual dining place with very upscale dishes on the same place their wine list is extensive and very well selected it is your one stop shop for making a great meal at home for a special occasion or bring the special occasion to here the portions quality of food and atmosphere cant be beaten good place for business meetings special occasions casual lunch and have fun with friends went last night for opening night and really im hesitant to even review this place just yet because i understand that all new openings require refinement at some level we were greeted by a great host station and friendly smiles which is always a good start to any meal once seated we were promptly given menus rather large ones and the great service continued we started out with a pick deal for meats and cheeses going with the prosciutto wild boar sausage and a thomasville thomme cheese all three were great and completely filling but i had enough left in the tank for dinner of course dinner for me was a wild game meatloaf and seriously was the best meatloaf i think ive ever had the decor is warm and appeal ling although it might be considered small i actually like that its not a huge dining hall the kitchen is always in view as well as some great window spots my guess is that this place will be a star joint in little to no time i went last night to check it out and have to say they have great food and a great drink menu the appetizer of the cheerwine flavored ribs are a must try along with the tasty basil gin drink they are new so i would say there has to be a couple of glitches in the system but i did not see it the food arrived at the table quickly and the drinks were well made even if complicated bravo now if only i could talk them into adding a few more veggies i kind of found out last minute that block grinder was opening this past monday and since i work in the area the wife and i decided to stop in and give them a try after looking at their online menu we were very excited to see bone marrow and sweetbreads on their small plates list as well as rabbit and wild game meatloaf on the entrees as usual we ordered way too much food but we usually skip dessert and we did just that tonight for starters we both really enjoyed the bone marrow the presentation of the bone marrow was perfect with big cross cuts ready to be scooped out and spread on the accompanying toasted baguette we also took charcuterie offerings to share the pork rillettes and a cured salami called molisana really hit the spot as both were packed with flavor we will certainly try some of the other cured meats in the future from the charcuterie offerings i may try the sweetbreads next time but they are served kentucky style here meaning fried which is not my preferred preparation on to the entrees i chose the wild game meatloaf and the wife took the red fish and we both split a side of herbed mushrooms the fish was cooked to perfection with crispy skin and the succotash sweet corn cream were fresh and packed with flavor the only gripe that i had with my plate was the over abundance of bourbon bbq sauce on my plate as it took away from the meatloaf itself i would recommend asking for the sauce on the side the wild mushrooms were great and always a crowd pleaser in my book as previously mentioned no dessert for us as we were stuffed i did forget to mention the biscuits and awesome smokey sweet butter that is offered to every table in lieu of bread as well there is a full bar with bar seating for food and drinks the wine beer and cocktail menu is extensive and i was promised that there will be taps soon but only bottled beer for now as for the rest of the menu all kinds of steak cuts and burgers salads and sandwiches with a fairly extensive lunch menu the service was a little shaky as it was our servers first shift but you could tell that the training and expectations are there for great service from the greeting at the door to the bartenders servers and kitchen staff we shall return with friends block and grinder is the kind of restaurant youd imagine in new york city or charleston true farm to table innovative and delicious in a nice laid back comfortable setting charlotte needs a place like this and after trying their lunch and dinner menus im hooked my friends and i were lucky to attend the preview dinner a few days prior to opening we ate what seemed like everything on the menu the standouts by far are the pork belly tacos which are glazed in sorghum topped with napa slaw and perhaps the best part atop this corn pancake the ribs appetizer were fall off the bone delicious as was the cod spread and their version of deviled eggs other friends that night had the bone marrow and acorn squash soup and they report good things what i really like are the tiny touches the small homemade biscuits made with grandmas recipe the fact the restaurant makes their own aoli the really knowledgable servers who are also friendly and good conversationalists i appreciate their recommendations and they didnt steer us wrong other standouts include the duck which comes with a delightful parsnip muffin as a side my friend cat and i could have eaten a whole dozen of those alone the only menu item we found could be better was trivially enough the mac and cheese maybe we need to try it again it was just a bit too viscous and not cheesy enough oh and the dessert comes out on a block of wood they call a sugar cube and i highly recommend the grilled pear its light and not too sweet and strangely enough comes with a cheerwine sauce that works really well a nice way to end a meaty meal good luck to chef kent who is really trying to make bg a james beard award restaurant the way its going now i wouldnt be surprised if that happens cheers my favorite burger i have ever eaten anywhere block grinder wins st and nd place for best burger i give them the other award because the competition is so far from what they are doing here rare burger real rare burger they are not playing here except the guy who wanted me to sit at the bar i can be more polite and i will be next time though next time he will probably remember me where is my food this burger is serious ordered real rare and delivered barely tan on the outside and dark red on the inside surprised the cheese was able to melt minimally seasoned with great flavor someone said simplicity is the ultimate sophistication so i like that they do not have a huge menu though the one they have was too much for me to figure out wild boar sausage fancy salami and a banger great appetizer perhaps overpriced as it was served my suggestion is to add some bites of the slaws and breads not like croutons im a hypocrite shannon did a great job handling a person so hungry they cannot read a menu and hardly has a vocabulary past barnet rubbles ancestors i grunt and point shannon taught me the ropes here real well the owners work here check the tools on display nice display case with grinders i told the head chef i mean butcher dude what movies to see midnight meat train and the french movie frontiers if you are a girl i do not recommend either of these movies if you are a dude well then i guess you might like to see them you could watch the trailers and see second visit i took my parents they loved it my dad ordered a rare burger so did i my mom ordered hers medium rare so glad i got to taste the medium rare without having to order one because the rare is so good cheerwine bbq sauce is the best bbq sauce i have eaten excellent green slaw was good needs work pear dessert was ok needs much work start over or skip dessert we went to block grinder on a sunday night for the first time we were immediately seated in the small narrow dining room at a table closest to the door and the meat counter so i had a view of raw meat all night it was something degrees out and the way the dining area is situated we got a blast of cold air every time someone walked in and out the front door which was a little too often we had to keep our jackets on throughout the entire meal and since my chair was in the wooden floored aisle i felt each every step servers and customers took as they walked behind me and there was a lot besides that we werent very impressed with the design of the dining room the restaurant seems like its trying to be intimate but with the way the tables are some directly facing the open kitchen some tables close so close together you can hear your neighbors conversation and my view of raw meat it doesnt feel very intimate especially for the prices and the great selection of wine they offer if they want me to spend on dinner and another on a fine glass of wine i feel i deserve a bit of intimate atmosphere the back of the restaurant seemed nice and more intimate but there are only a few tables there the rest of the space being occupied by huge walls of wine bottles i think the wine should have been where i was situated to create a partition between the front entrance and the dining room and i should have been back there enjoying a nice dinner that said we had just wanted it to be a casual night out all we wanted was to try their burgers and not spend a lot of money on a big fancy dinner while the lunch menu seems like it has a lot of great sandwich options we were pretty disappointed with the dinner ones there werent a lot of burger options for a place that prides itself on its meat there was one lamb burger one veggie burger and three beef burgers cheese cheese bacon or mushrooms cheese really thats it i ordered the cheese bacon burger with a side of a wedge salad the restaurant wasnt that busy but the salads took forever to come out there were certainly enough chefs behind the counter that i could see was the salad chef not in these are salads people they should not take minutes the salad finally came and it was actually one of the best wedge salads ive ever had it looked more like bibb lettuce than iceberg so it was a lot more tender and the blue cheese dressing tasted fresh and homemade of course since they came so late we werent finished with them by the time our burgers arrived it wasnt the servers fault i could see that he was waiting for the chefs to prepare the salads and put them up for pick up the burger itself meh im sure the quality of the meat was fantastic and it tasted good but when i order it cooked medium and the server even tells me that medium is red in the middle i dont expect a well done burger on my plate on top of it was the smallest melted piece of cheese it was so minute and thin that you wouldnt even know it was on there so i certainly never tasted it with each bite the bacon was thick but a little too well done as well and there wasnt much of it that was the extent of my burger no other toppings or dressings a well done burger well done bacon and barely any cheese on top of a dry hamburger bun needless to say i needed my water glass refilled several times on the other hand the french fries that accompanied the burger were amazing they were truffle flavored and tasted delicious would we go back most likely not i can get a tastier burger at several other places in town bad daddys cowfish or even red robin and if i want a great steak id want a place with better atmosphere where im not shivering having my seat jostled every time someone walked by or staring at a brightly fluorescent lit meat case throughout dinner tried this with a girlfriend and was blown away by the quality of the food we started at the bar with drinks and the cocktails were fantastic hand muddled basil a terrific old fashioned some great martinis then we moved to dinner in the dining room both of us had burgers and the meat was ground fresh that morning probably the best burger ive had in ages it was so moist and juicy i got the bacon cheeseburger and i rarely get cheeseburgers but i knew this one would be good and it was just delectable before this i wouldve said my favorite burger was at frans but i think this surpassed it my friend got her burger medium rare but it was so fresh we werent even worried about the meat quality then the owner came around and talked to us very charming and the wine pours were impressive id go back in a heartbeat its not in my neighborhood its in cotswold and im in dilworth but ill move around for that food and i thought the prices seemed incredibly reasonable yes yes yes my husband and i live very close and have been anxiously awaiting the opening of block grinder we tried it for the first time friday night and went again today for easter sunday brunch we loved everything friday night dinner we got there around and that seemed a good idea because it started to get very busy shortly after we were seated he had the mint julep i had the gin basil smash weve been looking for craft cocktails like that since we moved here this fall from portland or found we each had the wedge salad there didnt seem to be much difference in size between his full and my half but oh well the bacon in it was enough to make up for that wow i had the ny strip he had the pork chop and we shared asparagus a little rich in oil for us but thats just preference we shared a bottle of wine too i dont remember the name but franklin our server both times let us try a few before we committed very nice brunch today didnt disappoint fresh squeezed oj i had the french toast with a side of that cant be skipped bacon he had the corned beef hash both we amazing weve found the service very helpful and friendly they even brought out additional asparagus when chef saw our serving and didnt think it was enough we never would have known this will be our new hang for sure tried it twice for lunch and each time i had great service and excellent food their steak is outstanding its as good as del friscos though the dining room and bars ambiance can not hold a candle to del friscos then again neither can their prices which are about half of charlottes expensive steak houses make sure you order their fries they are great if you like a good cup of coffee their french press is excellent be aware that excellence is more expensive than mediocrity i look forward to trying out their bar one evening and experiencing some of those drinks the other yelpers recommended this place will definitely be added to my go to places for good food they really deserve four and a half stars my husband and i drove a bit out of the way to the cotswold area for dinner last week and we are sure glad we did i think this new place has a lot going for it we had about a minute wait so we hung at the bar i ordered a cardinal gin and soda with lime and my date got a bakers bourbon they serve them with care and travis took good care of us we got seated and ordered a glass of chateau campuget and stoller pinot noir which hit the spot next were the small plates charcuterie with two meats and cheese boar sausage was good smoked berkshire ribs deviled eggs and the bone marrow all good and the bones were big enough to actually have something in them also the place is a butcher shop so i took a lb of slab bacon off their hands that stuff is impossible to find in charlotte my group of four visited tonight for the first time i have to say it was just ok i love the concept and the atmosphere but the service was lacking to be more specific it wasnt our waiter he was great insead it was the kitchen staff and their mistakes first we immediately got a table yay and we ordered our drinks and apps the apps arrived before the drinks ok not that big of a deal but there was more second we ordered our meals and two of the four dishes arrived before the other two both dishes were cold and the other two did not arrive until the waiter noticed and had to go to the kitchen and start all over the food comes back and was incorrect and the cold meals originally delivered were simply reheated have you ever had reheated duck i dont recommend it parents were in town for the week and decided to try block and grinder out really enjoyed when they had the butcher shop on selwyn so already had a feeling it was going to be good we tried everything started with the deviled eggs pork belly and the ribs deviled eggs were creamy yet you had a nice crunch with the prosciutto pork belly pancakes were unreal pork was cooked perfectly with a nice crunch and savory glaze could of sat there and eat those all day lets not forget the ribs which fell right off the bone couldnt believe we hadnt had the entrees yet yes there is more we got the wild game meatloaf and the shiitake and gruyere burger meatloaf was delicious eating that with the mashed potatoe croquettes which were crispy on the outside and smooth very flavorful on the inside i couldnt have asked for a better steak burger which brings me to my next point once you go steak burger you cant go back no more ground meat for this guy great meal ready to go back and try the rest love the concept today was a block grinder type of day so i heard this place use to be a panda express good thing it wasnt when i walked in i was amazed on just how much of a transformation this place had to undergo to change from a chinese restaurant to the best new meat factory in charlotte nc first off the bar is stacked i feel like a jock in high school writingsaying that with drinks out the wazoo and the bartender knows what he is doing hes a mixologist the drink i tried was called parkside fizz new amsterdam vodka lemon orgeat mint soda minty but good the ambiance and decor of block grinder will make any restaurant decorator drool its like your eating in the butcher shop which you are i wouldnt be surprised is other restaurants come here to get there meat ground alright enough of that on to my meal i decided to switch things up and order the lamb burger best damn lamb burger i ever had enough said the lamb was juicy succulent savory and just delicious i didnt have to add any type of disguise to my burger at all no ketchup mustard mayo anything the feta cheese was the perfect accent to this burger the only thing that threw me off was my girlfriend and her friend screaming about how great the bacon was just because they made their own bacon on the premises on the side there were some pommes frites you could tell they were fresh but just a little to oily for me overall block grinder was a perfect exclamation to my night and it also is a must try to everyone in charlotte and all visitors when you go to block grinder i hope youre lucky enough to meet chef kent graham if you only talk to him for one minute the passion for his food is loud and clear it comes through in his wonderful inspired meals great to have a meal from a chef that truly loves to cook i was meeting friends for dinner and i got to bg before they opened luckily they let me in anyway and guess who was there my cm ben g and his lovely wife jj i knew i was in for a treat then lol the restaurant is beautiful on the inside chic but simple with cool wooden menus i had one of their handcrafted cocktails blood water while i waited on my guests very nice with a little spice from the ginger beer and creole bitters and the blood garnish my waitor jeff was very nice he and i and chef kent got a chance to talk before they were officially open for the evening chef kent shared that they may be adding a late night offals menu kind of like an offal tapas this is great for those like me who may be a little leery of variety meats as of now i think bg is the only restaurant offering offal in the charlotte area chef kent lights up when he starts talking about it its going to be great anywho for dinner i had the spring chicken it came beautifully perched atop a sweet potato arugula and onion hash this wonderful hash had bacon in it bacon thats made in house of course like everything else i dont eat pork but i ate every single little bacon bit wich was more like small pieces of lardon darn you bacon you gateway meat the chicken was cooked perfectly it was juicy with crisp skin both of my guests had burgers one had the bacon cheddar and the other had the lamb burger which is an homage to chef kents favorite chef i heard no complaints from either bg also has a small wine cellar where you can go and pick out a bottle and bring it back to your table its hard to chose between the great selection of wines and cocktails you cant lose either way bg is unique in offering a retail butcher shop along with a restaurant i love the concept you know right where your food is coming from and where its made super fresh check this place out im going back for lunch soon nice staff but not worth the money pastrami sandwich was a joke as a whole the restaurant has potential but i dont think ill go back any time soon my review is for lunch not dinner so i suppose its unfair to make a sweeping judgment based on one meal but overall i was not impressed they did an amazing job marketing this place their website is professional full of beautiful food photography and their facebook page is active and lively the restaurant itself is modern bright and nicely decorated but all of this did not translate to the plate myself and two friends had lunch at block grinder on we had heard they had been open for a few weeks but we decided to wait to make sure they were in their groove and everything was running smoothly i had the house cured corned beef sandwich with fries pommes frites one friend had henrys grilled cheese sandwich and the other had the bg burger theirs came with fries as well the burger was to be cooked to medium but came out too rare it was not very well seasoned and my friend said it was a little bland her fries were ice cold my corned beef tasted very good but it was basically or slices of corned beef maybe oz slapped on a piece of bread with a tiny smear of mustard thats it something this simple and plain should not cost at least put some slaw or a small salad on the side i also received ice cold fries the last dish was the grilled cheese i didnt think pear and cheese would work together but they did it was actually the best thing any of us had and saved this review from being one star again more cold fries were served with this final plate cold fries are unforgivable from a place trying to pass itself off as made to order id rather wait another minutes for everything to be cooked fresh and come out hot than have fries sitting around in the ac while the rest of the food cooks we assumed they would be swamped so we arrived at they open at but there was only one other table that had people it was a larger group of about but the rest of the place was empty and never really filled up the minutes we were there i think what is disappointing is the fact that our food got cold despite there not being a rush and there were at least or servers also i get that they want to try to be high tech but using an ipad to take our orders and also run our credit cards right at the table is awkward instead of saving time it actually took more time because our server had to hunt and peck the order in rather than just writing it down and punching it in at a register the traditional way also his credit card reader didnt work on the ipad so he had to go run our bills the old fashioned way regardless cool idea but poor execution finally if i were to judge bg solely on taste id give them a but theres room for improvement in that department and theres so much more to the overall dinning experience that needs improvement as well cold and undercooked food is a huge negative in my book not a great first impression but hopefully they will read this and improve ill give it another shot in a few weeks block grinder is a cute little place with a great concept i love that they focus on farm to table foods they grind their own meat so hello medium rare burger and really enjoyed looking through their extensive wine beer and cocktail lists they might still be working out a few kinks or our waiter might have just been a little wacky but there was some general confusion overall the food was good but i would not say this is the new best charlotte burger hey liberty youre still on top the biscuits at the beginning were delicious the baconcheddar burger and the mushroomgruyere burger were both solid and the fries were great i hope this place stays open because its a cool concept but they might need to work on a few things like adding some better salads to the menu the seasonal vegetables were actually just cucumbers tomatoes and carrots according to our waiter we didnt order it which is disappointing up your veggie game and youll be golden i had the opportunity to visit block grinder for dinner and drinks for my second time now and what a treat this visit was for a yelp elite event so we were very well taken care of and the staff and management were very attentive but even if i had just come with my husband they would have been just as great i had the opportunity to sample of chef kents creations chicken heart and mushroom salad pork belly fried chicken skins with chef mikes homemade hot sauce underneath a boston wedge berkshire ribs sweetbreads and wild game meatloaf with a potato croquette not all of theses delish bites are on the menu but some are so look for them give the cocktails a go as well if you ask for the off the menu chupacabra and they are able to whip one up for you order it its pureed habanero peppers with passion fruit i believe and titos vodka happy taste buds right there i just like the vibe of this place and the friendly passionate and attentive staff it doesnt get better than this rather small space but the kitchen is always crazy busy and everything that comes out is incredible its a restaurant and a butcher shop that serves top notch quality meats cooked to perfection so far weve just sampled the burgers the beef is ground in house and cooked to order when you say medium its a true medium the flavor is outstanding i thoroughly enjoyed the block grinder burger as well as the veggie burger on recommendation by our server their lamb and feta burger is superb as well the liberty just got ousted the lightly seasoned fries on the side are a nice complement that support the main dish not just filler the micro sized biscuits you get while waiting are addictive like you wouldnt believe we were also told to try the deviled eggs not sure what they do to them but its definitely takes them to a whole new level they have a fairly robust beer and wine list that covers every flavor profile you would like on both visits the servers have been as knowledgeable about the beverages as they have been about the food and are eager to share what they know everyone weve encountered so far has been remarkably friendly even when its busy they dont suffer quality of service the only downside is how busy this place can get weekend waits can be up to minutes definitely want to call ahead next time i might have to try one of the entrees i can only imagine how great the steaks are and i have my eye on the rabbit dish too stopped here after dinner for a drink the interior is small but well set up there was nobody at the bar so we sat there they have a really interesting and unique drink menu based off of old fashioned drinks you dont see any more feel bad for the bartenders because they are definately labor intestive they were not super busy which was nice the bartender let us know on frisat it was insane in there its new its small and i am sure it gets way packed i will definately go back to eat but aim for lunch or an off time the bartender did talk to us quite a bit we really were not looking to talk but figured they were bored since not a lot going on she complain about yelpers eating there and the reviews they were posting which i found amusing have been here twice the food and service gets better each time i eat here glad this neighborhood gem is close to where i live as i expect this will be a regular stop have stopped in here times and have been bowled over each time it is a small restaurant with a small bar but the place feels just right the staff is super friendly and nice bartenders are professional and have fantastic drinks looove the dark and stormy i have had the meatloaf charcuterie platter brussel sprouts chicken and various other items everything was absolutely great and you will pay a bit more for it but it is worth it the best thing i cant get over and this probably sounds so weird is the brussel sprouts i get them everywhere but they are the best i have ever had here blanched lightly with a light sauce and served with bacon i think i ate almost the entire side by myself it was out of this world will definitely be back love the service and the option to buy meat to go for the fridge thanks guys id tried to go to bg for dinner but there was always a really long wait so a girlfriend and i decided to try at p m on a friday success we were almost so early that the staff was unclear why we were there late lunch maam nope drinks and dinner the atmosphere is very modern with light wood and metal but its somehow still very cozy its packed a lot into a small space butcher shop wine shop restaurant and bar the bar is small but has an open feel with all kinds of beautifully colored glass bottles against the window one small suggestion to make the bar perfect add purse hooks my new personal crusade for every bar we sat at the bar and i got a boring ol gin and tonic but my friend got a creative basil concoction that was inventive and refreshing the basil was so fresh there were a bee on it talk about farm to table the three bartenders who waited on us were friendly and funny and they had great food and drink suggestions for dinner friend got the pimento burger and i got two appetizers pork belly and bone marrow a meat smorgasbord the burger was one of my top five in charlotte the pork belly was wrapped in corn bread pancakes so it was like a pork belly taco i perhaps took too long to eat them because the first one was awesome and the third one had sat in the bourbon and sorghum glaze too long and had gotten sticky and messy i had never had bone marrow before but i loved the presentation we actually had to scoop the marrow out of three bones vegetarians need not apply here the breadcrackers it came with were a little salty for my taste so it was hard to get the full marrow flavor im glad i gave this place a second attempt i always love it when a restaurant takes reservations but i guess right now they dont need to get there early and come hungry for a cornucopia of meat save your money fast food has better quality beef their t bone is totally missing the tender side of the cut it is a rip off and high priced it is meant for people who do not understand what they are ordering or what they should receive my new favorite restaurant in charlotte best burger in town hands down and one of the better steaks ive had im no expert on steaks though a cocktail list thats actually exciting and reasonably priced excellent appetizers i will be back and be back often i had high expectations for this place and it did not disappoint great service during our late sunday brunch and the best burger ive had since moving to charlotte a year ago the bacon and pimiento burger is a must order my husband had the bg benedict with house made biscuits which was also delicious we cant wait to go back after all the positive reviews on the burgers here i decided to give this place one more try i am still not warming up to it although the nite we were there they were experiencing hvac problems so i was warm for a while sat us next to window that generated even more heat dont know how they are going to sit patrons next to those windows where summer comes the entire floor plan is just weird now for the food ordered burgers but not without drama waiter had his little portable order taker which took him twice as long as the conventional way of just writing it down even took all of the condiments we wanted for burgers and patiently put them in the wait seemed long for the amount of people in the restaurant at the time but we passed the time by drinking wine mind you room temperature red wine which was now the actual room temperature of degrees the wine is stored in the back of the restaurant but from where we sat the wine was exposed to sunlight at least in the mid afternoon which raises the temp again just annoying little things all nite burgers came and waiter plopped down one plate of condiments for burgers and said the chef said that was enough for people say what why did you ask and take down our specific requests for the condiments if you were just going to bring a generic plate to the table onions and tomatoes cut so thin you could not even taste them on burger between the three of us we ordered medium rare medium and medium well burgers and two of us opted for summer salads rather than fries all three plates were dropped at table all with fries so after getting waiters attention we got our salads we assumed that the burgers were placed before based on our cooking preference but after placing individual condiments on the burgers and taking the first bite we realized none of us received what we ordered so maybe it is just me but this place does not live up to a burger not does it deliver in the service dept either so good ohhhhh soooooo good i would hand out stars but they have some work to do on their wait service we waited what seemed like an eternity for drink refills extras such as cream for the coffee or butter for the bread etc now on to reasons why this place rocks its a butcher shoppe and a restaurantbar its farm fresh they make hand crafted cocktails i had the idols eye new amsterdam vodka pear lemon ginger beer boston bittahs which i would give a out of it was great other drinks ordered and tasted were the gin basil smash very basily lemony and fresh loved it new fashioned really good for an old fashioned not my style though and a manhattan pork belly you must try it its mouth watering and served with cornmeal pancakes ohhhh so tastey they serve marrow with their steak its awesome their burgers are out of this world one of the best burgers ive eaten ground fresh the duck oh the duck you have to try the duck youll want to lick the plate im telling you the wait staff places your order via an ipad and pulls up your bill on the same if you like tea try the earl grey creme brulee its scrumptious so so good but so so expensive we had drinks appetizers wine entrees and it was about person that ate up our date night budget for a while they dont take reservations mind you they are so small the line will be long it will take some patience but get a delicious drink from the bar while you wait i wanted bg to bowl me over and i hope that one day it will a recent weekday afternoon was not that day even though the restaurant appeared to be fully staffed and i purposely chose a late lunch hour to avoid having to assess when the place was slammed at prime time an older male server was quick to greet and seat but the assigned server for the table apparently didnt get the message for a few awkward minutes other staff pitched in and took our drink order so kudos the for team work and the refreshing gin basil smash which was perfect for a summer afternoon a half size lettuce wedge of butter lettuce super homemade dressing and grape tomatoes was great in all but one respect at least percent of the signature bg bacon bits were charred black throughout and inedible rather than complain which i really hate doing i left the black bits conspicuously clustered in an otherwise empty bowl to see how the server would react nada she carried the bowl right by the chefs on the open grill line and into the kitchen without cluing them in or indicating any concern to the disappointed diner a cheddar burger was ordered medium rare but arrived medium with barely a trace of pink though the high quality grind remained flavorful i would have liked to add a pinch of salt but alas no shakers or better yet grinders were provided or offered while fries get good marks here an alternative summer salad of marinated cucumbers tomatoes and red onion was a welcome and bright low carb alternative the gratin dish in which it was presented held at least half a cup of marinade however which seemed a costly waste from the owner perspective and quite drippy for the diner though having a real linen napkin was a touch of class and consideration much appreciated all in all bg offers quality ingredients but needs a quality control eye on dishes before they leave the prep line servers should be coached to back that up and be a bit more proactive in noting obvious plate glitches given the number of comments about off mark grilling some coaching there could add a fourth star to this rating what a disappointment for a restaurant that showcases its meat it seems laughable that the hamburger meat quality was not as good as burger king complete with gristle and was overlooked the seasonal salad had zero flavor fries came out soggy the first time the unsweetened ice tea was the only saving grace good service at bar generous wine pours some non meat offerings expensive the food is excellent and we loved it only down side is its always packed and we had to wait awhile for our drinks from the bar we sat at the bar because we had to wait for a table and we were sat before our drinks were even put in the system i wanted to like block grinder truly i did honestly its got potential but unless we hear that some changes take place we probably wont be back at least for dinner the overall ambience is crowded and loud they pack far too many people into way too small of a space i can definitely see this making sense as a lunch spot but for dinner it was much too crowded to be comfortable case in point the space between tables is so narrow that people trying to walk through cant help but make physical contact with each other maybe the servers have squeezing in between diners down pat but the elderly ladies sitting at the table next to us did not my idea of a good dining experience doesnt include having two elderly womens rear ends rubbed against my neck and shoulders as they try to squeeze by to exit the restaurant we tried to give them as much room as we possibly could but theres just no room to maneuver if youve got mobility issues which these two women did it was incredibly uncomfortable for us and im sure the ladies werent happy with it either service was somewhat slow and there seemed to be confusion about what drinks were available we ordered beer and wine nothing fancy we were disappointed they said they wouldnt be serving oskar blues since oskar blues now brews beer in brevard nc and we like to drink local if we can after appetizers a random server cleared some of our plates but not all same with silverware he never brought replacement silverware for those without which seemed odd and we were left with dirty plates there were high and low points on the menu high points the charcuterie was good and the deviled eggs were delicious the mac and cheese and brussels sprouts are also good low points the burgers somehow they managed to overcook all three of our burgers we all requested medium and everything came out well done the shiitake and gruyere burger was delicious even though it was overcooked which speaks to the quality of the meat one of my friends ordered the scallops which were the special of the day the scallops were also overcooked theres seared and then theres burnt and outrageously expensive for sea scallops with some fennel and red pepper sauce really i would have sent my burger back but since our server didnt come by to check on us until well into the meal there didnt seem to be a point in doing so bg has great potential our experience boiled down to wonderful ingredients poor execution i hope they can get it together soon we arrived pm because they are not accepting reservations yet good move as we were seated immediately there were of us dining wait servers leave a lot to be desired we had to request water often because of small glasses and no one keeping them full when we finished dinner we had to request our dirty dishes be removed my wife and i share a dinner and we had to request another plate even though we stated when ordering that we intended to share we expect to return and hope the wait staff is clued in to their duties it takes a big person in this case at least to admit they were wrong and boy was i wrong i have tried this restaurant two times before with lukewarm results but last night was so good i am still thinking about it i ordered a steak this time the filet was so tender literally you could cut it with a fork the meat melted in your mouth probably the best steak i have had in months hubby had rack of ribs with cheer wine sauce that had a wonderful kick to it but our service was impeccable forgive me i know his name started with a d and he introduced himself as de nice i think he offered up a wonderful red blend wine and knew our needs even before we asked i understand there have been some staffing changes and it appears all for the good new menu items were introduced by the wait staff dont you just love it when a waitperson actually knows the menu right down to how a dish is prepared de nice detailed the new items and then offered up suggestions i can highly recommend block and grinder for a great dining experience and ask for de nice because he was the bomb farm fresh local food butcher shop craft cocktails seriously would i lie to you this place was fun and the food was delicious im totally pleased with the crowd and the ambience dont go here for a romantic tete a tete four of us went out on a saturday night and managed to grab a high top by the bar while we waited for a table sadly we didnt know that we would have to get up go to the bar to order our drinks alas after ordering the bartender did bring the drinks to us dinner was delicious we ordered a few appetizers to share they all were good our server was nice but an over sharer who probably dropped a little too much profanity while she was hanging out by our table she was nice but we were here to actually hang out with each other not our waitress i would definitely go back this place had a good vibe and food was good love the close proximity to my house bonus my mother came here for lunch and liked it so much that she brought me for dinner the next day well when we came back the experience was completely different and we were disappointed the service was pretty good but the atmosphere was dull and the place was full of well dressed south charlotte white people with designer handbags i felt very out of place the chairs were uncomfortable and we were seated in the middle of the restaurant where people were moving around us constantly its not a large space and it seemed like half of the people in it were the waiters i think too many for the small number of tables as for the food my burger was dull and the bun was stale my mom had the mushroom and gruyere burger again she had it the first time and loved it but found the second time around it wasnt as memorable maybe it was just because of the night we were there but contrary to how my mom felt about it i thought block and grinder was a dud came here for lunch and was happy but not overwhelmed the service with ipads was nifty and the restaurant was immaculate with a good vibe my burger was a bit small and not that exciting very good quality of the meat the sides were unique will be back to finish off my gift card but afterwards wow this place was great what a gem the staff was extremely knowledgeable and attentive the wine selection was great i actually sat down when the wine rep was there almost every server and manager tried an array of wines before approving any for sale they rejected several before landing on two bottles i got the cheeseburger and it honestly was one of the best ive had in recent memory in charlotte that brioche bun was amazing and the burger was cooked to perfection they said they grind their burgers in house pretty cool they said they sell the burgers in a premade set ill be back for sure before my next cookout given that it wasnt very busy when i was there pm lunch the chef had time to come over to me and ask me how my food was we got to talking and i was super super impressed with this guy he really knew his stuff and had an enthusiastic creativity about him that really shined through on the menu choices he prepared i could tell he takes real pride in his work i will be back again especially to try those devilled eggs my server was telling me about first off props to block grinder for hosting several preview nights before opening glad to be invited to the last one when we first arrived we were handed a drink menu with several types of specialty cocktails spoke with the bartender who mentioned they will feature classic old style cocktails like a sidecar and modern cocktails we had the tequila daisy which was quite tasty and had a bite in the liquor the blood water is also very good but would probably only order one the bartender also made a specialty basil drink which i would highly recommend a smooth drink indeed these are all drinks i would sip and would pair nicely with dinner if you are looking for a night out with drinks dont feel like this is the place when we sat down for dinner the server was amazing any questions you asked he knew the answer to he was fully aware of all the ingredients and despite the busy nature of the restaurant he definitely took his time and always had a patient pleasant demeanor highly impressed by the staff the invitation night allowed us to try many different items the palmetto cheese is basically pimento cheese made with cream cheese it gave it a smooth consistency and basically what we expected the pork belly tacos were amazing best thing we sampled all night long the tacos came wrapped in a potato pancake and topped with a cole slaw type mix definitely a winner for entrees we ordered the duck carolina rabbit and porterhouse steak the duck was tasty with a nice crisp outside and i would order it again wasnt too impressed with the sauce that topped the meat it had little flavor and didnt feel as though it complimented the meat the carolina rabbit was served wrapped in prosciutto and surrounded with grits the presentation was great and the entree was also tasty the porterhouse we were quite disappointed with we order the steak medium rare but it came out medium with the outside edge almost medium well the steak wasnt seasoned which left the entree bland towards the end of the cut a few pieces were quite delicious and tasted as though it was seasoned it lead us to believe that maybe the chef was in a hurry due to the full house and the steak was left mostly unseasoned by mistake and then there was the dessert the server informed us the desserts would rotate depending on customer reactions and the seasons we order the creme brulee which was good and full of flavor we finished with the seared pear topped with a cheerwine sauce the pear was difficult to cut apart and while i compliment the combination of the sauce with cheerwine it wasnt my favorite and wont be ordering the dessert again however block grinder is certainly a restaurant id visit again on occasion the price points are a bit high for entrees so it wouldnt be a regular stop of mine but definitely a place id sample again to see what the chef is cooking up had brunch here on mothers day it was incredible the bacon is homemade the coffee is delicious french press and my husband who is a burger snob said it was probably the best rouged he has had in a long time cant wait to try dinner my husband and i recently ate dinner here for the first time with another couple and it was wonderful our server was very knowledgeable about the wine options and drinks offered from the bar we were pleased with the wine recommendations while this place features incredible quality meats i ordered the lentil burger because i am plant based and it was wonderful i loved it and would order it again the amount of food was very generous also my husband ordered the pork chop and it was awesome it was very simple and the rub used had excellent flavor the chop was grilled and done just perfectly our friends ordered the scallops and filet they were very happy with their choices three sides of veggies were delicious pan seared corn sweet potato succotash and brussel sprouts were delicious i would definitely recommend dining here my first visit to block and grinder was this past weekend and it was fantastic our waiter was very attentive but not overly so very knowledgeable about the menu and helpful in offering suggestions my boyfriend was torn between different choices and the food was just amazing we started with the deviled eggs which were awesome my boyfriend decided on the venison flank steak which was a special that night and i had the duck having never tried venison before and being slightly hesistant to try it block and grinder set the bar very high it was amazing and the duck with the warm peaches on the side was fantastic the portions were generous though neither of us had any trouble finishing our meals we had the bread pudding for dessert and it was definitely a good choice yum we sat outside so i cannot comment on the indoor seating but it seemed totally fine its trendy and not an intimate restaurant but we arent typically looking for that type of setting its a little louder and more casual while still being upscale their prices are very reasonable considering other restaurants in the area and the freshness and high quality of your meal i actually was suprised it wasnt more expensive given the level of service and ingredients you definitely get what you pay for when it comes to food and the meals here are totally worth the price really looking forward to our next visit we saw so many amazing meals being delivered to neighboring tables so we cannot wait to go back and try more from the menu i like how this place does not tie itself to clt restaurant conventions not a large seating area but plenty of room for those who are seated no excessive noise but a comfortable dining experience with a focus on the almost decadent meats where else can you get bone marrow roasted in side a large bone sawed in half we a large dose of a fresh garlic pesto and a special fork to get it out they have a foie gras burger my wife asked if she could have foie gras alone and was quickly accommodated with a huge appetizer portion with little pieces of toast and thinly shaved prosciutto i had the lamb burger medium rare which was phenomenal with a strong gamey flavor and tasty aioli sauce accompanied by pomme frites that were perfect some brussels sprouts garnished with house prepared bacon was as good as those at tupelo honey the waiter mike was great very knowledgable about the food and its preparation he did a good job pitching us on a dill based bloody mary mix that is excellent only weakness is the dessert menu which lacks a chocolate dessert good meal albeit a little pricey service efficient and friendly lacks any sense of occasion that the prices imply burgers looked good and seemed well received my steak was small and lacked flavor not sure about the return visit i get together regularly with a group of friends for dinner with recommendations from a family member we looked forward to a dinner at block and grinder reading all the positive reviews about great wait staff but sadly that was not our experience cant say enough good about bartender friendly prompt with nice wine and cocktail selection wish wed dine at the bar a tip to our waitress amy when something is wrong apologize and fix it its wasnt my fault really isnt the right response so if you are a party of dining on a friday night id recommend going elsewhere there are too many good restaurants that give good and consistent service had my first visit last evening went with a classic cheeseburger with bacon given the reviews i had read this was very good the burger was quality meat and you could easily tell that it was fresh ground on premises the bacon was incredible thick cut and cooked to perfection decent beer and wine menu i wish the bar area and restaurant itself was larger but other than that this place is pretty good good and bad but the bad outweighed the good havent been back since and dont plan to unless someone invites and treats service is subpar we called to make reservation on sat night and they said they didnt take them but the wait was mins we said ok see you soon planning on spending time at the bar we were seated at the bar and excellent but very pricey cocktails the bar tenders was chatty but pleasant recommended some favorites and talked on and on about other stuff at about mins in i checked with the male host and was told i told you mins and its only been so i sat back at the bar to wait after another mins i inquired again and was told he was under the impression we were eating at the bar per the bartender we said no never said that and wanted a table we were then sat a a two top in the back by the wall our waiter referred to the as the time out table we got up and decided to skip dinner and pick up burgers on the way home as we walked outt he host said no problem we could take a nice big booth by the window so we decided to stay after being seated the manager on duty stopped and said he heard about he miscommunication and offered to buy us some apps and another round of beverages we both ordered some wine and they brought out pork belly and deviled eggs which were off the charts delicious then after a long wait our entrees came i ordered the bar tender recommended game meatloaf and it was burnt dried out and burnt then my wife got a burger and it was small and overdone we ended up leaving without finishing our drinks or entrees and at one point when i was checking our table i overheard a lady ex judge recommend to the host they should handle this didnt know what at time before they got sued later when walking to our table the floors where slick as ice and i had to support my wife to make sure she didnt slip and break something we later assumed that was the judges warning not sure if host is the same or the cooks are any better but a few good apps and a couple over price but tasty cocktails dont compensate for all the missteps the place is small and cramped maybe they worked out some early bugs but my first experience did not leave a good impression and ive been back since if you do make sure you dont get seated at the time out table and send back food thats burnt or not cooked well not only is block and grinder great for dinner jed and his team gave us a perfect brunch after our daughters baptism planning for the brunch was a pleasure and the event was perfect the food was delicious and the staff was wonderful with adults and kids alike if you are looking for a great place to host a private event id highly recommend them our first time to visit block grinder will certainly not be our last my husband a culinary institute of america chef graduate and our two dear foodie friends decided to try it out we all checked out the menu and reviews prior to our reservation and wanted to see this unique concept and try out their interesting menu we were hesitant at first as few very few of the reviews were not very good leads me to wonder if their critique is an example of their experiences every place they sample let me say this first those negative reviews are not reflective of our experience at all we has a delightful experience it began with our reservation we needed to push back minutes because we had a delay they were more than accommodating on a busy friday night and we enjoyed waiting at the bar having great and interesting cocktails from a bar well dressed in interesting spirits friendly knowledgable bartenders the bar dining area are a bit small but from our research prior to our visit we were prepared for that no problems here as i said bartenders were attentive and very quick at taking our drink order plus a small bar area only lends itself to easy fun conversation and the ability to share great conversation with other patrons our cocktails were great the guys chose the maple manhattan wonderful and their dark stormy that is an interesting and delicious black rum and ginger beer combo our waiter john was exceptional offered great commentary of the dishes and very knowledgable about wine offerings wonderful personally we all shared deviled eggs and beef carpaccio we loved the carpaccio but the deviled eggs needed a bit of seasoning and were pleasantly supplied with their own blend of seasoning salt one mesquite flavored the other their own mixture pared well as the accent needed awesome the guys shared the bone in ribeye and short ribs outstanding the veggie sides were farm to marker local and the best green beans i ever had nice preparation and flavor beef was absolutely seasoned and prepared to perfection we girls shared the shiitake mushroom with gruyere cheese burger cooked medium on a delicious bun ridiculously delicious the pommes frites again perfectly seasoned and green beans delicious the grits with the short rib dish also great finish with the table splitting the brandy bread pudding thanks waiter john and call it a win cool decor great ambiance outstanding service and food worthy of my hubbys praise that dont come easy and a table side visit from the chef made dining at bg a memorable first impression add in fabulous table conversation this place is surly to be on all of our must do list of great places to dine in charlotte delicious cocktails charcuterie was awesome i ordered a veruca salt cocktail it was tasty but nothing spectacular the burger was great cooked perfectly with a nice roasted pepper spread i have no idea why the small patty was served on a giant bun i would have preferred a bun that was the same size as the burger it seemed like the restaurant didnt want to go to the effort to have buns made for them the service was terrible after my cocktail i stuck with water i was empty so often that i eventually drank the water of my table mates dessert wasnt offered at all im not going to rush back to this restaurant i love the atmosphere here i always love a place that has a wine display i find it soothing overall the decor is welcoming and intimate the wood tables are charming the staff is very friendly i went with a group of seven women all divas including myself as first timers we had a ton of questions and comments our waiter was very patient and pleasant i went with the bg burger its their classic hamburger served with a plate of standard condiments lettuce tomatoes mustard ketchup you can add your choice of cheese and bacon for a few bucks more i added the ny cheddar cheese and the fresh cut maple bacon the burger was very tasty the meat is super fresh and it was grilled perfectly it was a bit smaller than i expected though the patty wasnt big enough to fill the bun the burger comes with a side of fries or a summer salad i opted for the salad it was good but calling it a salad is a bit misleading it was a medley of greens topped with a basil vinaigrette wheres the tomato cucumber carrot something the greens and dressing were good but i was a little underwhelmed tip you can order fresh meat steaks burgers have them marinated and take them with you to prepare at home this is a cute restaurant with good food there were so many attractive options on the menu i had a hard time making my final selection i cant wait to visit again next up i wanna try the deviled eggs with goat cheese and prosciutto the lamb burger and the parmesan grits our waiter chris was excellent my burger was just ok i am not a fan of fat chunks in my burger the quality of the meat was questionable and the flavor is compromised when you get unpleasant surprises in your mouth yuck the fries are fresh cut and tasty it is just a burger place trying to be white table cloth dinning the two are contradicting i had heard so many rave reviews about block and grinder i could not wait to finally eat there a little background i am a big fan of steak lamb etc etc i dont eat it every day but when i do i want the best we started with the deviled eggs with goat cheese and prosciutto yum the goat cheese added an extra creaminess to the yolk and i could definitely pick up on some truffle salt that was super delicious for my entree after debating between the filet and lamb burger i went for the lamb burger i was feeling extra hungry and naughty the lamb patty itself was delicious i really enjoyed the melted feta on top but found it to be a bit overpowering to be honest i was expecting a larger burger and found myself craving more and i am one of those people that hates super large portions i did not think there was enough meat to the burger the fries it came with were very tasty but not out of the ordinary i tasted my dads filet and it was delicious but again on the small side for dessert we split the chocolate pecan pie tartlets they were so cute and tiny served warm very good would have been even better with a scoop of vanilla i have to say that my cocktail was excellent the final fig with topo vodka cointreau fig syrup and lemon very strong but sweet and yummy definitely one to sip on i would return to block and grinder but wish they would either increase their portion sizes or lower their prices to match the portion sizes we had been wanting to go to the block grinder since it opened and we heard some great things overall the food was stars but the atmosphere and service was stars in terms of service we sat down in a cramped space next to a large table and did not have a waiter assigned to us after minutes we finally had a waiter who was very nice notice that no one was assigned to us from there he took over but he also had other large tables so the service was slow on to the positive aspects for an appetizer we got the jar of pimento cheese and crackers which was delicious and probably the best pimento cheese we have had in our short time being exposed to pimento cheese we decided to order the ribs for an entree which was a great choice they were lean and tender and rank up there as one of the best ribs we have ever had i think we would come back here but would attempt to go on a weeknight or off peak time which would hopefully improve the service i would also love to try the cocktails we loved this place its got a really nice local dinner spot vibe and has reasonably upscale food without feeling pretentious cheer wine bread pudding is awesome and im not typically a bread pudding fan weve been here twice and have been very happy with it both times came here a couple weeks ago and enjoyed the experience immensely except for the wait of course we didnt have a reservation so hung out at the bar and had drinks for about minutes we werent in a hurry so it was fine but if you want to sit immediately make reservations and make them well in advance on to the food which lets be real is what we all care about we ordered cheese charcuterie plate we went with the fennel salami vsop gouda and the mobay all of which were yummy the fennel cheese is very fennel y so if you dont like fennel youve been warned i will say that i felt their meatscheeses were outrageously expensive i compare them to what i can get at good food on montford which are similarly delicious and you get twice the goods for slightly more than what bgs charging i know i know quality over quantity i just dont think im enough of a meatcheese connoisseur to think what theyre charging was worth it that said we still enjoyed them the bg burger their signature burger grind i went pretty mainstream with my entree choice and was not disappointed from the moment they sat that burger in front of me with its little bg branded bun i was a happy camper burger was cooked perfectly bun was great fires were great it was great did i mention it was great sides of pan fried corn brussels sprouts mac cheese in my opinion these were easily stars of the show these arent particularly inventive or crazy sides you see them in various forms on lots of menus but what set them apart was the execution they were all just perfection my mouth is watering just thinking about how great each of them were makes me desperately want to try to the rest of the sides could i get a meal of just sides i kid i kid sort of i cant exactly remember what my boyfriend ordered i think i was too enamored with my food to care a steak or something that im sure was amazing well done bg well done slash the prices on your meats and cheeses but otherwise keep up the good work p s they have corkage fee which in my book isnt horrible but then im from l a so take it with a grain of salt small quaint restaurant with wine room and butcher shop inside their burgers with truffle fries are really good with buttered buns their sides are good as well rating only on food where to start i guess ill start with the good then the bad as sadly there was some things that stood out that irked the party as well as came off a little odd for appetizers we ordered the pork belly deviled eggs and the jumbalaya it was all delicious however the only question was on the deviled eggs was served on some wine menus is that to soak up water or something maybe it was to hint to get some wine ive always known that whatever you place on the dish should be edible maybe they didnt get the memo my best guess is that is so it doesnt slide off the dish but still there has to be a more creative solution the jumbalaya was the winner in the appetizer choices though it had flavor and a little kick at the end to top it all off entree i ordered the oz ribeye steak oscar style which meant that there was crab meat on top was it good yep do i suggest you to get it yes only if you brought a big appetite with you because that was one pretty big ribeye but of course i finished it sides that you have to try out are the mac and cheese those are amazing now to the bad our waiters name was amy and well some things went down before my brother and i got there and some things after i arrived my party told me when i arrived about minutes late that the waiter came up twice about when we were getting there first telling my party that at there was another table coming and that the whole party wasnt here second time complaining about when we were coming now when both of us came i observed she was very touchy and feely she caressed my mothers arm and then proceeded to ask her if she shaved her arms and then went to my father and caressed his arm what the fuck anyways i saw her come back and then apologize for rushing us to order and the previous comments however this was after we ordered worth of food i think she wanted to make sure she had a tip at the end she continued to say that management was rushing her way to blame it on the people who hired you she constantly made weird comments throughout the night such as i got this cake from that table because they wanted to give it to me or how about taking a customers baby and then proceeding to introduce the baby to other tables lets just say this restaurant is not a family restaurant im pretty sure thats not the ambiance that they are going for its a pretty high class steakhouse with some feelings from my party of being judged of not having enough money to pay for the meal to just weird comments or inappropriate touching of customers it changes the experience but if i was to solely judge the food its definitely a place to go eat i definitely will be back again but ill ask not to get this waiter again or else ill switch tables i know this is a star restaurant in my books but you know what they say when the service is off the food will feel a little off as well i was hoping for much more from this establishment unfortunately i will not be returning block grinder comes up short against the local competition i would recommend georges brassiere or good food on montford over this place the food was prepared well three of us ordered the fillet all medium rare came out medium rare one well done you can probably order anything on the menu and find it satisfactory but not outstanding this was our first time here my friend said it best it wasnt awful the wait staff needs work our waiter was a disorganized mess we had to practically beg him to take our drink order and our food order toward the end if the meal the kitchen staff dragged two nasty garbage cans through the dining area this was really bothersome and just gross i addressed my experience with the manager kyle he couldnt have been a bigger jerk about the situation i explained to him that the experience lacked what i could find elsewhere as i felt i could get a better value and experience at good food georges ruth chris or mortons he questioned my opinion informed me he used to work at ruth chris and that this establishment was much better our total bill far exceeded what we have ever spent at any of the restaurants i mentioned above but find those other restaurants to be much better happy new year the owner and i were able to talk my friends and i will be going back to see if they can improve on our experience we were really looking forward to coming here since it opened i had read about their burgers but once we got there the ribs were calling me i decided to get the ribs as an app and get the burger i got the burger medium and it was perfectly cooked i got it with the pimento cheese and bacon the bun was extremely soft the cheese was soft obviously and the meat was soft it came out without bacon on it which would have added the extra texture to break up the softness but i was hungry and it wasnt worth mentioning it overall it was delicious my wife got the special which was a gumbo like dirty rice it had venison sausage in it that was a first for me we are excited to go back to try other menu items the food the service were great amazing manhattans pork belly deviled eggs steak and roast everyone loved their meals we had a party of four and had great service but the restaurant was not too busy we will definitely be back the same group of friends and i returned a couple weeks ago the food and service experience i will be taking my in laws here next time they visit i am glad thing turned out well and really excited i can recommend this locally family owned small business really was looking forward to trying this place after a recommendation from a friend and looking over the menu but after the conversation i just had on the phone with them i dont think i will ever be stepping foot in this establishment while trying to make reservations for i decent sized party i was first told that the time i wanted on a saturday night would take up of their tables we could be accommodated after when i questioned the logic of a guaranteed party i was told that reservation was just not available i dont think it was the fact that we couldnt get a table as much as the way robert i believe really didnt care at all if my party and i ever walked into the restaurant been here a good handful of times since they opened and they have just gotten better very pale friendlygluten free friendly for those of you looking for a healthy non cheat option during the week steaks are grass fed and there is usually a wild game option servers are amazing and you can go and pick out your own bottle of wine from the wine racks bartenders are creative and make some good cocktails you can even bring home some grass fed meat from their butcher case always great food always excellent service menu is creative without complication and prices are well deserved as the quality is phenomenal they have the best grille master in town that can cook a steak to perfection on his sleep and a mixologist that can mix up amazing new fun at the very least they have the best burger in town finally a neighborhood place thats not a chain and understands the importance of loyalty and customer service i dine here every couple of months the quality of the food is unmatched the wild game meats are always paired with great sides that compliment very well great cozy atmosphere phenomenal wine list and incredible service round off this farm to table restaurant i love it love it love it ask for amy or rod oh yeah the cocktails are super creative and interesting bill the butcher welcomes you paying homage to mr william cutting so lovingly portrayed by daniel day lewis in gangs of new york is a tradition among bar patrons that i will start next time i visit the venue is best appreciated while empty on a sunny late afternoon sun blasts over the catholic church and glistens on bald heads the staff is unfettered attentive even tables and consciences are clean you may have to ask the waitstaff to keep the blinds up and sit at a table with your back to the butcher counter to appreciate this sunny vista this place is a specialty block grinder stands up in positive fashion for taste and quality of food decor creativity of menu and personality of servers and staff not a party scene not inexpensive i have difficulty answering yelps survey questions about this place for a cocktail i had the chupacabra goat sucker a mythical mexican monster strewn about s vernacular from an x files episode this was a green concoction of vodka passion fruit anaheim pepper syrup and lemon a bit spicier than i like the heat from the pepper in my throat kept me from drinking fast stayed sober never had the next drink i had in mind the pork belly is something delicious on very thin pancakes i preferred the belly without the pancakes tender and succulent it was no need for pancakes for a quality sharing plate order some charcuterie i chose proscuitto di parma wild ass boar sopresatta with two accompanying cheeses its a good bet to ask the server which cheeses go with whatever meats you are having we had the cana de cabra yes thats two items in this review with cabra in them which means goat in spanish and one of the goudas both fantastic the proscuitto was top notch rhythmic goodness their wild boar sopresatta comes in thick slices of tasteful explosiveness and is similar to chorizo or pepperoni the two benefactors accompanying me ate the deviled eggs of which i have zero interest asked where they ranked on their list of all time greatest deviled eggs both men gestured positively my suggestions are to let them do what a butcher does best meat cheese and cocktails i would like to thank the staff at block and grinder for the fabulous night it was my daughters th birthday and the night was very important to us from the st call to make the reservation the whole experience was terrific we were all treat like royalty from the moment we walked in the food and service were perfect i am not one to be shy when something is not right but also one to compliment when something is good in thius case it was great congratulations on a job well done and thank you for making this important night so special for my daughter pm the food was amazing and great portion sizes wine was poured generously which is nice for a change i had the smoked chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus and i cleaned the plate the wedge salad is also fantastic with real local bacon overall this place was awesome love that you can buy wine and meat at the same place while still supporting local farms best burger in town better than bad daddys or liberty toasted bun to perfection awesome fires very friendly great spot its tucked away in a little plaza ive driven by so many times and missed it dont make the same mistake we went for lunch and sat outside im hoping when summer really kicks off it wont be enclosed they had a good beer selection i got the cubano it was really good but my boyfriend ordered the burger with a duck egg bacon and cheese amazing i will order this next time the burgers are angle more expensive but worth it the service was great the meat was correctly cooked and seasoned the wine was well paired with the meal fantastic just experienced block grinders new brunch menu there arent enough stars so amazing premier service amazing food had shrimp grits with scallops and venison sausage dank tasted the duck hash superb and their potato cakes are like nothing ive had before but want over and over again oh and lets not forget the perfection of their pork belly appetizer available on other menus as well always a great experience both in taste and service breakfast lunch and now brunch kudos bg tremendous food in a cool atmosphere trust the wait stuff on whats hot and fresh as far as meat offerings are concerned the menu changes very frequently based on availability try something different the fries are in best of charlotte category the pork belly appetizer is a dont miss your first time the bison burger was tasty full of flavor im already planning our return block grinder offered an experience that i couldnt possibly argue with the food was amazingly delicious our waiter was fantastic and the atmosphere was cozy and nicely done we had heard good things and werent sure what to expect after hearing it was also a butcher shop we were pleasantly surprised we were seated immediately and our waiter instantly approached us and was charming right off the bat we are huge meat eaters and were already rereading a menu we memorized before heading there and were trying to contain our enthusiasm while ordering after rattling off the specials we skipped due to my dining companion and to my dismay the pork belly app and instead had the scallops and the bone marrow the scallops were fantastic and came with a little pork belly so it was like a two for one and they were a hit our waiter advised that he enjoyed the bone marrow with his steak so we did the same and waited till our entrees arrived my boyfriend got the half rack of lamb in mint pesto with sweet potato hash and brussels sprouts they were fantastic the mint wasnt overwhelming the lamb wasnt too gamey and i really enjoyed the brussels sprouts i had the oz bone in ribeye in a veal demi and a side of asparagus moment of silence please holy heavenly delicious it was perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked and i was sad once i was towards the end also our waiter was completely correct the bone marrow with the cuts of meat was a great combination there was a lot of food and we split everything but we cleaned our plates entirely on top of that unbeknownst to us it was half price glasses of wine so that was a great added bonus we really felt we walked out eating very well for a very very decent price getting a oz cut of meat at a well known pricey chain would have been x the cost so between the salivating worthy food our great service and the nice atmosphere we will most certainly be back very soon i went here based on raving yelp reviews and was so disappointed while they have a wonderful atmosphere and awesome cocktails i was completely underwhelmed as was the rest of my family we tried the deviled eggs which were pretty good but the rest of the meal was lackluster our burgers were all overcooked and dry and for the price pretty small we were so excited to try the meat that is local and fresh and were so disappointed when it didnt come through our waiter was excellent but nothing else was much to write home about after spending on burgers deviled eggs and a glass of wine we wont be returning i really like the idea of the block grinder but i really dislike the execution for starters getting into the location stinks this isnt just their fault there are plenty of other places in the same shops that have the same problem about the only way that is easy is if youre headed uptown on providence and im never headed that way unless i think of it in advance which i never do beyond that the hours never work for me i tend to think of it as an afterthought and though i dont often get out late for whatever reason i tend to get by block grinder late so i find it odd when we pop in at or so and are told that they are closing this is the perfect place to kick back have a cocktail and enjoy some bites that you cant find much of anywhere else in town but you cant because they are closing half an hour earlier than their hours say they will i get that they dont want to start something late and thats fine but at least a cheese plate or something would have been nice and keeping the amazing bar area open would be even better oh well if you should happen to get there at a better time then the food is more interesting than just about anywhere in town and the cocktails are totally worthwhile try the chupacabra if you can get it great food and service very nice atmosphere inside and outside i had the hanger steak with truffle fries the steak was great the fries ok i never understood the hype with truffle fries my friend ordered the mahi mahi dish it was really good cocktails were really great id go back and try different dishes i love this place wonderful farm to table fare upbeat staff and good music piped into the background been there for or dinners they always are spot on still thinking about the venison i ate two hrs ago i was very excited when block and grinder opened i was looking forward to a nice local place that had great food especially steak its a great spot but i feel the good is subpar and overpriced portions are good but i expected a lot more for the money as far as flavor is concerned ive been a few times now and is want this place to meet my expectations but it just falls short of wowing me every time i go just had the most amazing dinner filet with gorgonzola cheese was amazing everything was awesome great wine selection we had a pretty large group sp we tried several appetizers and everything was great we will be back very soon great food great wine great service i am in the restaurant service business so i am in and out of restaurants all day and perhaps im a little more critical than the average person with that in mind i give block and grinder stars we had the pork belly appetizer and loved it if you like bacon you will not be disappointed yum next we had a wedge salad that was very nice followed by the bone in prime rib they cut all of their own meat in house so needless to say it was a beautiful cut of meat and it was prepared very nicely at medium rare temp tasty we had spinach for a side that was ok erica took care of us and was there when we needed her and made several good recommendations monday night is price wine by the glass so we had fine wine to go with dinner following dinner we had a small french press of coffee which was definitely enough for the two of us to enjoy with the bread pudding desert if you like bread pudding you are in for a treat my loves it and said this was the best shed ever had she particularly liked the fresh figs in the pudding we split everything and still took home a large cut of steak i am a guy that prefers dark restaurants so i was happier when the lights were dimmed around pm overall i really liked the food the service and the vibe of the restaurant we will definitely be back and i highly recommend that you give them a go as well happy dining pork belly appetizer was to die for a little more pork belly a little less garnish mixed greens could use a little love there is a sprinkling of oil it is literally leaves on a plate shitake gruyere burger so rich it was as if you could taste the difference in it being local this will become one of my new standards came on a busy friday night didnt have reservations but got seated on the porch within minutes great outside atmosphere in the front of the restaurant which is hidden in a shopping center on providence rd waiter was great ran through specials like a boss we opted to split a caesar salad just enough without ruining the meal which was out right afterword you can dress up your burgers anyway you like burgers are small in size but big on taste ny cheddar bacon burger lover delight every additional topping you add to a plain burger it will cost you but its worth it my burger was great fries that come with the burger and an extensive drink list cool thought that this place is also an operating butcher shop so if you want to take a cut back to grill on your own you can couldnt get myself up to the challenge of ordering a camel steak which was one of the nights specials ill go back on hump day went to bg tonight to try out something different hostess was fantastic and friendly when we walked in with no reservation got seated in less than minutes one issue is that while sitting at the bar i definitely encountered some sticker shock theres virtually nothing on the menu thats in the single digit range besides their sides i was definitely hoping to walk out for less than a person but youre looking at person minimum if you get waters and burgers word to the wise i stopped feeling as apprehensive once our server matt showed up the specials speech is a little long but it rounds out a minimalistic menu with some exotic fare from the beginning to the end service was top notch friendly without being intrusive intuitive to a t little things like not offering dessert when i clearly wanted the check are subtle but appreciated we started out with the fried green tomato salad this is a pretty delicate dish believe it or not and as a native alabamian i was prepared to say meh instead i left pretty wowed nice and salty still glistening actually green tomatoes and a sauce on top that actually added to the experience instead of detracting from a mediocre tomato like ive found happens in charlotte and high end eateries far too often the greens under the tomatoes were damn good as well we both cheaped out and got the mushroomgouda burgers if you get the toppings separately the burgers are gonna be closer to but you do get spoiler great thick cut fries with them of course theyre referred to as pommes frittes here which mildly pissed me off haha burger meat was fantastic perfectly cooked gouda was perhaps more mild than i assumed but the mushrooms were a little fresher and harder to bite through than i expected id much rather them be like they were than overcooked and super soft buns were almost a contention point i cook a mean burger myself and almost nothing makes me more furious than a bun that gratuitously hangs over a patty i saw our burgers waiting for us under the heatlamps in this style and prepared to be ticked off no dice the buns were so delicious that i forgot about how lame they looked normally i throw overhang away the buttered bread was good enough on its own to eat with the burger being out of the park i cant imagine how fantastic they would have been if the patty had been more flattened to be clear i see where theyre coming from the sear on the outside provided a lot of perfectly medium center for my mouth to enjoy just a nit pick i suppose all in all i think bg probably deserves a mostly cause the value quotient just isnt there its a small place with an open kitchen so dont expect intimate conversation they get stars however to counteract the people who leave star reviews where they detail how they had the audacity to confront another patron about their language i experienced no crude behavior whatsoever during my visit but seriously get the fuck outta here ive been to bg a couple of times as a customer for the butcher shop part of the business the quality of their meat is excellent and they have very attentive customer service tonight we went in for dinner as my mom is in town ive been telling her about the place and she was eager to try it i will agree with others who state its not in an ideal location but this is a classy sleek joint i was in the mood for a beer and they have a lot on tap i had a smoked amber that was very good i ordered the pork belly appetizer and my mom the beef tartare ive had the pork belly before and it is amazing the bourbon sorghum glaze is delicious and the pork belly cooked to perfection my mom was very happy with the tartare but would have liked it served with a sturdy rye or different bread for texture we both ordered the special of a salem hills farm grassfed ribeye over a salad of heirloom tomatoes arugula and vinaigrette and both ordered our steaks cooked black and blue for those that dont know what black and blue is its a very rare steak sear it and put it on the plate the steaks were cooked to perfection and the heirloom tomato salad a perfect bright complement we also ordered two sides to split the garlic cheese mashed potatoes and the butter wilted spinach both were very good and a good portion of each to split between two neither of us finished and brought steak home but that left room for dessert i had the banana pudding and my mom the chocolate creme brulee the banana pudding was very good served with crisp nilla wafers lots of fresh bananas a lovely chantilly cream and topped with caramelized bananas the pudding itself was creamy and packed a punch of banana also tasted like a banana puree my mom liked her chocolate creme brulee particularly the richness of the chocolate our waitress red was friendly knowledgeable about the specifics on everything we asked her and provided the great service that i would expect in a restaurant like this all of the staff were friendly and attentive and it was a great customer experience was it pricey yes i dont mind paying for a seriously great meal the only thing that kept them from five stars were the bar prices my boyfriend took me to block and grinder for my birthday and what a treat it was ther service was impeccable the food was delicious the portions were large and the ambiance was marvelous i started with the fried green tomato salad it tasted so fresh my boyfriend started with the caprese which was equally as good i had the short ribs they were perfectly flaky tender and tasted so good that i forced myself to save some for breakfast the next morning my boyfriend had the filet and there wasnt a piece left on his plate definitely go here it is one of the best places to eat in charlotte the food the atmosphere the bar i love it great food chill vibes all local charlotte staple excellent food and service my only issue was the waiter commented that it seemed as though i did not bring my food appetite but my drinking appetite i found this offensive especially since i am in a life threatening illness and find it difficult to eat while my small amount of food was wonderful i was embarrassed about his comment so much that i discontinued drinking our wine due to his comment everything was so fresh and tasty the beef tartare friends favorite pork belly super flavorful deviled eggs not recommended did not taste like goat cheese tiny little itty bitty slice of prosciutto on each piece tomato mozzarella salad w balsamic loved huge slices of tomato very friendly server loved the cute atmosphere everything was delicious the bone marrow was a very interesting appetizer that i am glad i got the new york strip and spare ribs were some of the best i have ever had i will be going back here often i will start out by saying they have a great local beer selection both i tasted were great suggestions i will add them to my list we started with the lamb lollypops and they were delicious i had the braised short ribs and my date had the venison chili my dish was perfect in taste and temperature kenneths not so much but it was so good he didnt want to send it back the servers are attentive and the atmosphere is peaceful it was so quiet i didnt even realize there was a television on at the bar area i enjoy an atmosphere where i can actually hear the others at my table i will be back this is now on my favorites in charlotte list my husband had the best fillet in his life he raised herefords so this is quite the praise i had the deviled eggs wasnt impressed my mom makes better very good lunch today had the pork belly small plate wife had the bg burger service was great food was excellent we look forward to coming back for dinner sometime soon food was amazing server was in serious need of training food delivered to the table and she waited until we were half way thru the meal to check on us even with the restaurant less than half way full ive been hearing a lot about this place but since my wife opted for a vegan food regimen hitting up a place with counters of steaks and a menu focus on meat is going to make for a difficult date night so when i was in the area on my own i popped in for lunch nice menu with of course a lot of meats i chose the store made pastrami sandwich with a side of mac cheese grilled on rye bread the meat was tasty and the bread was crispy maybe a little greasy but thats to be expected the mac cheese was excellent im not sure what cheese they put in there but it was creamy and tangy with a little bit of bite to it also a little oily at the bottom and thats also to be expected service was good the speed of my meal was good and the price was acceptable looking forward to returning with a meat eater this terrific neighborhood steakhouse and butcher shop is a great alternative to the more upscale spots in southpark and uptown and a wonderful addition to south charlottes restaurant scene my wife and i celebrated our anniversary there a few weeks back and thoroughly enjoyed our meal our filets were cooked to perfection the salads were crisp and delicious and our sides of mac cheese and garlic mashed potatoes were both outstanding for a restaurant its size block grinder boasts one of the best wine selections around along with a knowledgeable waitstaff who can confidently recommend the best pairing for each meal theres also a terrific selection of local craft beers on tap and a small bar for when you just want to drop in for some drinks and an appetizer after work besides the wonderful meal and attentive service what i liked most about this place was its casual laid back atmosphere feel free to leave the jacket at home youll do fine in jeans and a polo shirt its the trendy neighborhood spot youd expect to find in dilworth or uptown yet only minutes from the arboretum and stonecrest my wife and i will definitely be making another trip to block grinder maybe next time well even take home some chops for the grill ive heard wonderful things about bg and decided to stop by last night with the girls we began dinner with a bottle of montepulciano a delightful smooth red wine shared among the three of us and a perfect complement to our meal our waitress was very sweet and accommodating as we took our time catching up drinking wine and browsing through the menu we settled on the pork belly pancakes bg wild game chili and beef carpaccio as appetizers and this was definitely our favorite part of the meal a lingering smoke followed my first bite of the pork belly and with the complement of a slight sweetness from slaw made the perfect combination of originality and flavor the beef carpaccio was thinly sliced smeared with pesto sauce and sprinkled with greens and slices of parmesan while the chili provided the sweetest comfort on a cold fall day in november the same endearing waitress sold us on the burgers as she referenced the premium quality of meat that bg provides and the tenderness yielded from being grounded in house i went with the wild game burger and last nights selection was elk though the presentation was beautiful and i loved how bg was branded on the burger the flavors were sub par the last time i had elk i fell completely in love with its tenderness and flavors i think a lot of those flavors were lost when grounded nonetheless it was a decent burger but i will opt for one of the chefs selections next time we ended the meal with house made apple crumble and bread pudding both were delicious and i am a complete sucker for anything that is made in house the apple crumble was my favorite as the softness and warmth of the apples fit perfectly with the crunchy texture of the crumbs and the cold vanilla scoop of ice cream on top i will definitely be back to bg to try more of the small plates and probably a steak or the duck confit next time im so happy that i finally decided to check this place out i recommend you do as well if youre looking for some delicious food the location is nice but i feel that the parking is a little tight note that there is also additional parking underground eating at block grinder was the first time that i had used the underground parking not too bad i really liked the atmosphere of this place its just the right size for a nice and intimate dinner with a small group of friends of course you can have a bigger party there but i enjoyed the intimacy i had with my friends definitely check out the decor all around there were skillets near the wall i was sitting close to and at the top near where they display the steaks i noticed a grinder displayed within the wall i just loved looking all around at the different decorations i had visited this place for dinner and it was just amazing if you are in a group and dont mind sharing get varieties of the small plates i had tried the pork belly bg wild game chili and the beef carpaccio the beef carpaccio was my favorite but it was definitely hard to pick which one i loved the most at the time this morning i did wake up craving those pork belly so it made an impression on me for my entree i had ordered the cajun bison burger i was super excited the burger was good but i was hoping to have more taste of cajun spice but i just didnt taste it it was still pretty good for a burger when i had asked for some pepper i had pepper and three other selections for salt try it out for my side i had ordered some garlic mashed potatoes and once that hit my mouth i knew i mad the right decision in life order it as your side the service here was really wonderful as well all the staff were pleasant and helpful you wont see a mean or sad face here so my suggestion if you live in charlotte check it out so b g has been open about years now and even though my favorite bartender in charlotte kyle no longer runs the fantastic little bar im a huge fan we go way back won their summertime cocktail contest and my husband came in second i also like to pick up steak or slab bacon rare find in this city while im there because the restaurant is also a butcher shop anyway to the food the menu changes seasonally and they get what they can from local farms etc everything is just so thought through by chef ben from start to finish the most recent visit was on one of their first nights with the fallwinter menu we started with the bone marrow thats served with a great gremolata type spreadsauce killer stuff my sister who lives in l a and is a chef might i add shared the wedge salad which is a deconstructed salad with butter lettuce in lieu of iceberg next the big guns i got the smoked pork cheeks which was one of the yummiest and most satisfying meals ive had in awhile highly recommend that my husband got the always delish trout and my sister got the duck im typically not a big duck fan but this was so succulent and my sister said best duck ive ever had just go just go already also wine by the glass is half off on monday not sure if bottles are half off plus we had a server wed never had before actually everyone in there on monday was new to me savvas was our server and he was outstanding the best burger place in charlotte without a doubt had a lamb burger with feta cheese and curry aioli amazing price is ok a burger cost somewhere around dollars but it is totaly worth it this place was alright its super pricey but to be honest i dont think it deserves the steep price tag you can get crazy fancy stuff here like bone marrow not my cup o tea but hey you can get it i got a veggie burger and while it was branded with the letters bg it just didnt stand out too much otherwise dinner for three was about yet the place is in a shopping center if you wanna impress a snooty person bring them here otherwise red robin has a similar tasting veggie burger for bucks burgers were outstanding but the steak well for a steak in a butcher shop it shouldnt have been chewy however those burgers were enough to make me come back and the fries some of the best i ever had i gave my husband my steak in return for his fries boy that tells you something eh the meat was cooked well and was very juicy but i just couldnt chew it enough to get it down i actually did that disgusting thing where i chewed as much as i could turn discretely took the steak carcass out of my mouth and deposited it in a tissue on my lap im hoping no one saw this but the alternative was to not even have the few bites i did we made reservations and its a good thing we did still we were seated at a table in the middle of the dining roomarea i hate that id much prefer a booth especially as we were the ones courteous enough to reserve in advance why not take my preference into account ahead of the walk ins so menu is good somewhat expensive good selection the spread went between steaks and then burgers which seemed a little off if im having a meal do i want to be next to a group of college kids having burgers and beers you wouldnt hear them anyway as its awfully loud the deviled eggs were good a shot of vinegar really woke them up the peanut butter chocolate bread pudding sounded better than it was it tasted burnt to me as chocolate cake sometimes does when its thin and overcooked however the salted ice cream that came with it was marvelous we wanted to end with a coffee as it smelled so yummy but they only serve french press and thats not really a great idea at pm for some people ahem not me all in all a mixed review if you want an expensive course romantic dinner look elsewhere if you want a great burger in a jumping small place oh and the fried were ahhhmaaazziinnggg turn this is a great spot it succeeds in one area well but i think they are trying too hard to be a fine dining establishment coming up to my first swanky upscale experience in charlotte i was excited that it was bg as i heard it was amazing its smaller than life restaurant makes for a very nice ambiance as its not too loud but slightly crowded as per my thoughts the decor very clean slightly modern with a bunch of hominess the small space give it a warm feel that counteracts the slightly upscale feel you get when looking at the menu its a very clever way of designing the restaurant to a point where you might not want to leave for a bit the service really good service to a point where i didnt expect it to be that good it reminded me a lot of what service was like at the high end restaurants in vegas explained the menu very well and articulated the special of the day venison with ghusto that pretty much made me want them to just take my money refilled out glasses with water consistently food came out at a good time and kept asking me if i wanted more alcohol like that should be a question the meal honestly the food came up short the beer selection was great the wine not so much i got the special which was the venison with some greens which turned out okay the venison was cooked just the way i liked it but it lacked a good amount of sauce which i like the greens werent bad but the deserts we practically ordered half of them were all very good the short ribs which i tried from my cousin were downright amazing so ill definitely come back for those overall ill come back here again to try their other signature dishes they seem to have a well balanced menu and its definitely worth it to taste a bit of everything such a unique place a great find our waitress was funny knowledgable and did a fantastic job the food was amazing we will definitely return and recommend this restaurant to other couples oui chef one filet mignon three lamb two duck ratatouille i make a lot of business trips to charlotte and im always looking for a great meal my boss brought me here almost a year ago and we enjoyed it so much that when a coworker and i were back in town we opted to come back we had no reservation this time so when we stepped into the restaurant which was empty at pm the hostess asked us if we had a reservation i told her no and she gave me a look like there was no way they could accommodate us ummm what she looked around and saw the same thing i did an empty restaurant she begrudgingly sat us as a top table with little favor ok sure our waitress came over quickly and asked for drink orders neither of us wanted to drink as it had been one of those days where we just wanted yummy food and then to go crash back at the hotel we discussed with her the charcuterie plate first and then she asked if we wanted to go ahead and place our entree order so we did i opted for the filet i got the ribeye last time and while it was delicious my friends filets looked better and since i really wanted something starchy i got sides the garlic mash and the spinach a trade off my coworker also ordered a filet and he got the cheese mac and cheese after a time our steaks came out but no charcuterie weird so when the server came back by we asked to make sure it was not on the bill she politely told us we never ordered one okay sure she wont be winning any server awards the food was delightful my steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare as i ordered i was worried after the charcuterie debacle the spinach was my favorite side of the at the table with the mac and cheese a very close runner up i love a great sauteed spinach and this one still had some integrity not overly wilted and with some good flavor the mac and cheese had a good crispy texture from the topping and was not overly cheesy so that you felt ill afterward the mashed potatoes were good but no different than anywhere else we decided to get desserts since we were denied an appetizer i can rarely pass up a creme brulee but i probably should have this time around it was touted as dark chocolate but it was weak in chocolate flavor kind of flat it needed a serious punch to be able to carry the name dark chocolate my coworker ordered the apple crumble which had much more flavor and creativity in the dessert overall i do recommend bg the food is great but this trip the service was lacking and the dessert was a disappointment for me but that wont keep me from going back had dinner there last night with another couple my husbands steak was ordered medium and came rare he sent it back to be cooked a bit more and by the time they returned it after we had to ask for it the rest of us were almost finished with dinner it was though we totally were forgotten they did realize this and were kind enough to not charge for it but the whole experience was very disappointing small brunch menu but what they have is really good the benedict was great other folks with me said the elk burger was seasoned to perfection im looking forward to trying the shrimp and grits next time wow someone pinch me i think i am dreaming block and grinder was just as great the second time around as it was the first time almost a year ago the idea that a butcher shop can also be a fantastic restaurant is cutting edge in my opinion the reservations are super easy to make and they are very welcoming when you arrive parking is plentiful with handicapped parking within a few feet of the front door there is an outside area for dinning that is covered and warmed in the winter if you enjoy their burgers you can ask for a block and grinder bacon cheese burger kit that will have everything you need to grill out at your next outdoor picnic the waitstaff are knowledgeable about the menu and attentive to each table they serve i was very impressed by the quality and flavor of the meat of my bison burger it was delish i would most certainly come back and look forward to tasting some more fantastic dishes first time here i had the elk chops and my friend had the venison both cooked medium loved the elk but the bite i tried of my friends venison was amazing the atmosphere was great lighting was great fantastic dinner experience had an excellent meal at block grinder last night venison special was really well prepared and our friends had the kangaroo game burger which was also very tasty no rush on service and menu options cover different tastes few items to be prepared for it is a small place so it is loud its a fun vibe and feels neighborhoodsh just lean in to hear the wine prices are too high it doesnt make sense to me that decent wines have to be priced over to start there are many clt restaurants that serve great food and have fair wine prices we will be back for sure not much to say to this review soggy too much butter spoiledwilted salad over salted n yucky fries and the cuban sandwich so not a cuban also ordered the pastrami greasy bread no and the meat was soo fatty this was a to go order i ordered it when i got there i live right around the corner the service was wonderful plus when talking to jed after getting home to just disappointment he was more than happy to refund me for the whole order thank you much jed i honestly would give this place stars but only had a burger which was silly they also provided a ghost pepper aioli which was solid and added the right amount of kick these guys know what they are doing and have a great staff on hand cool bar to grab a cocktail with an awesome selection of bourbon will be heading back for sure went on a sunday before the opera without s reservation right when they opened party of it got busy quick so delicious great service cool concept will return i really enjoy this place i love that theres a market in the front where you can purchase meats to prepare at home i love the eclectic menu including the bone marrow dish many of the dishes have ingredients you might not have heard of but there are old standards too we did not try the steak but we might next time the restaurant is a little louder than you might expect but it is what you would expect out of a restaurant in nyc unique yet approachable i recommend trying this place this place is small and intimate maybe a little too small because the tables were so close together when i walked in the hostess asked if we had reservations i didnt even realize they did reservations even though we didnt have reservations we were sat right away i do like that you can make reservations here i tried the block grinder burger with maple bacon and pimento cheese i didnt like that the bacon wasnt thick cut i couldnt even taste the bacon on my burger and the pimento cheese was like sliced cheese melted on the burger its definitely not what i had expected overall the burger was good it just wasnt mind blowing i also had a side of mac and cheese im not sure what the different cheeses were but i could distinctly taste a cheese that i didnt like to complete the dining experience i had the chocolate and peanut butter bread pudding the bread pudding was good everything that i had here was good but it wasnt the best if youre looking for a great burger than i would rather go to the liberty sorry ive heard great things about this place finally tried it last night and boy am i happy about that seated right away and introduced to our great server matt was very nice and helpful and obviously enjoyed working there gave us some info on the restaurant and the daily specials bad timing for me since im in the middle of whole diet and most of them would not work they were extremely nice and very willing to work with the food restrictions i have thank goodness going out to eat is a little tricky on this meal plan my husband and i both ordered specials starting with homemade chili lime salt pork rinds seriously delicious i had the nc wahoo with green tomato relish over asparagus came with rice but it was no problem to sub it out amazing the fish had a delicious crust on it tomato relish was a prefect complement and the asparagus was cooked well my husband had the venison tenderloin with a delicious house made aioli and came with fried green tomatoes one of the best meals hes had here in charlotte we will definitely be going back i feel really sad about writing this because i absolutely adore the concept and i loved the food when i could get it but top to bottom id say the service here is spotty at best ive come twice now with the intention of eating food and left before that could happen because it just took too painfully long combine that with servers and bartenders having zero knowledge about what theyre sellingmaking and hostmanagement staff that have zero concept of how to seat people appropriately and you get a huge disappointment ive been here times on the first visit while the bartender was also our waiter and it took forever to get drinks the food was awesome and made me happy second time we were just literally and entirely forgotten left after terrible and delayed cocktails because it was just too annoying finally decided to give them another try tonight by making a reservation we showed up minutes early for and were very happy to order a cocktail at the bar while we waited but minutes later after paying for drinks we were still completely avoided not even asked for a refill or request for a glass of water there was no acknowledgement of our waiting i love servers and restaurants and appreciate them so much but no matter the food the service is a factor and this place has a problem we went here for dinner on a whim knowing that the concept was farm to table everyone at the table agreed that it was a good meal we were glad wed checked it out but none of us were in too big of a hurry to come back the quality of the food is high and everything was cooked well but given how expensive it was and how blase the atmosphere was nothing really stuck out about our experience just meh definitely a great place for a night out excellent fresh food and cocktails friendly knowledgeable staff dessert options have been limited the times weve been i would encourage owners to consider a few more options that arent as heavy on nuts or egg based dishes as there is a large population with allergies to those charlottes answer to the farm to table flock done properly without abusing a worn medium food is bright local fare with an emphasis on protein and southern contemporary cuisine you cant find a better burger in charlotte the liberty comes close chops and game are take home ready thanks to on premise butchering think tailgates and family gatherings and staff is informed polished and accessible cocktails are decided unique and delicious look for jed kampe the owner on random evenings hell bless you with more stories than mother goose ask for christo for clean service and wonderment of knowledge chef ben will entertain and educate you this was our first time at block and grinder and we will definitely be back ben our server was very friendly knowledgable and overall excited about their story and food he recommended dishes and wine which i appreciate we had the option going to the wine cellar to choose anything we wanted i had the pork chop with corn dressing and spinach instead of succotash the pork chop with the sage sauce was awesome my husband had the special burger filet ribeye and bacon ground together served simply with cheddar and shoestring onions he said he understands why they are known for their burgers lots to choose from on the menu and everything sounded great charcuterie and homemade pork belly are next on my list looking forward to going here again cool restaurant with an in house butcher shop food is great as i was able to sample some interesting dishes venison steak and an kangaroo burger both were fantastic and full of flavor the spices complimented the kangaroo extremely well the service was excellent and our server was always around to ensure the meal was going well definitely a spot ill be going back to great coffee fantastic cocktails average food we were disappointed there were no side dishes served with the meat and there was nothing exceptional about the taste either plus the dessert menu needs some help overall for the cost and lackluster experience i probably would not return here delicious from soup to nuts seriously we had the cream of mushroom devine and the summer squash both were outstanding we are working our way through the small plates and each one is better than the next the hanger steak and braised short ribs are must haves the staff is great and deservedly proud of the dishes they are producing very good friendly and patient service the ribeye was juicy and delicious the bone marrow was very flavorful my wife had the salmon which was delectable one son had the bison burger and my other had the lamb burger both were excellent we all shared a pan fried corn and it was a perfect accompaniment as a side the menu included pork belly elk burger and venison tenderloin i wish my stomach was bigger but they leave more for the next visit highly recommend this place is really worth trying if you havent already a great combination of inspired menu and semi casual atmosphere i enjoyed my experience overall but some of the details were lacking had the duck confit and it was amazing great flavor balance and perfectly rendered but the mushroom stuffing served with it was way over salty my guest got the prime filet great price as a special and it was good unfortunately like a traditional steak house they sell sides separately from the steak entrees and this is where the chef really missed the mark disappointing that they dont complement the entrees better besides that it was a fun and delicious experience enjoyed our lunch at bg both good atmosphere and good service my wife had the barbecue sandwich and fries which were both very good she said she would get it again also it was a thursday and that particular item was price which made it taste even better i had the blt which just went on their seasonal menu great bacon heirloom tomatoes and bread choice my only critique is that there was a bit too much tomato overpowering the other elements and making it difficult to eat the real treat was the pan fried corn substituted on the side i heard people rave about it and it is legit i could probably have eaten just this and been satisfied the block grinder concept specializes in premium beef all natural and organic meats wild game their goal is to create a back to the basics menu structured around fresh ingredients our night started off with a small charcuterie sample plater and some fresh made biscuits followed by the small plate of pork belly with a bourbon sorghum glaze over corn bread pancakes and topped with a green slaw this was easily one of our favorite dishes of the night and from what we could hear around the restaurant it was a big hit with everyone else too next up we tried the dry rub smoked berkshire ribs with a cheerwine bbq sauce and pickled slaw the first thing we loved about this plate was its impeccable presentation and bold flavor the ribs had a delightfully crunchy exterior with with perfectly tender meat and the sauce was full of bold flavor for our entrees ella started off the night with the butter poached rack of carolina rabbit with a loin leg roulade over stone ground grits the leg roulade was a delicious twist on such a fun choice of meat the grits complimented the rabbit really well and had a great sauce i just wished there was more great sauce though the rack of rabbit on top looked nice i found it a little unnecessary i couldnt figure out whether i wanted to try a steak or a burger so i got both the bacon and cheddar and burger was toped with thick cut slices of house cured maple bacon and ny cheddar cheese with a side of fries the fries were nothing special but the burger especially the bacon was absolutely divine i closed my eyes after every bite and transcended to a state of burger nirvana that could perhaps only have been surpassed with the addition of some sweet caramelized onions on top the only complaint i had at this point in the evening was that there was no ranch dressing anywhere in the whole building i became addicted to fries dipped in ranch the very second i moved to nc and not having any ranch was a significant let down for me the fries werent amazing to begin with but without the sweet and loving caress of creamy ranch dressing they were a little worse being the giant man that i am lbs i decided the charcuterie the pork belly the ribs and the burger just wasnt enough food quite yet so i got the oz porterhouse unfortunately it wasnt what i was hoping for i cant speak for every steak but my steak was completely devoid of any flavor at all except for one bite there was one single bite that seemed to have all of the flavor of the entire steak crammed into the one bite and the rest of the steak was bland and completely forgettable for dessert we went with the earl gray creme brulee with sugar biscuit and the bread pudding the earl grey creme brulee was not only the best thing i ate that night but the best creme brulee i have ever had the flavor of the tea blended perfectly with the rich creamy texture of the brulee to top it all of the sugar biscuit added a carmel flavor and crunch that was even better than the torched sugar usually sprinkled on top this dessert is a must have in my kitchen the bread pudding was decent but forgettable by most accounts block grinder is an amazing concept with a great menu we had a great evening and are looking forward to seeing the restaurant grow and succeed check them out if youre in the area and let me know what you think awful fatty meat hard fries no bread service and expensive we got a cheeseburger that had hard parts in it and the hanger steak which was so fatty we couldnt even chew most of it disappointing this is the classiest butcher shop i have ever been to if youre looking for a meat filled night out this is the place for you make sure you try the pork belly and the macaroni and cheese which is the best ive had in charlotte so far this is a great place to visit if youre looking for new versions of classic cocktails manhattan cosmopolitan old fashioned etc bring a full wallet an empty stomach and a date and enjoy awesome menu i had the lamb burger w a side of spinach all of the steaks and other entrees looked good too big fan of this place the food was very good and the service attentive the decor is hip but not overdone one particular aspect that i like about bg is that they include venison and other wild game as part of their menu i had the wild game elk burger and it was excellent great for lunch or a casual date night never had a bad meal here come here often one of the best moscow mules in town get the game burger you cant go wrong sadly disappointed based on the yelp reviews i read in charlotte for the summer and decided to try when my girlfriend came into town did brunch on sunday afternoon we arrive restaurant is half empty and are sat immediately sitting there just sitting there hostess realizes we could use water then realizes we dont even have a place setting and she was the one who sat us there anyways we wait for a good minutes without any contact from our waiter only an apology from the hostess finally waiter shows up doesnt seem that interested and just asks for our order as a former waiter i was mildly annoyed by this since its usually best to greet the customer ask if they any questions and make good suggestions my girlfriend goes with cinnamon rollsbacon and i end up with the bg steak and eggs with a bloody mary and coffee we wait we wait some more our food arrives before our drinks then our waiter finally delivers drinks and makes blunder after blunder after blunder i seriously dont know what this guys deal was the food mine was excellent steak was perfect asked for rare got rare and the cornmeal pancakes were an amazing addition blood mary almost tasted sweet wasnt a fan my girlfriends sweet roll was tasty and gourmet tasting but dry dry dry moral of the story dropped on non bottomless brunch for an unusually poor dining experience i think that was the first time in my life i tipped wont be back this edition of excited about eating takes us to block grinder in the south park neighborhood of charlotte this farm to kitchen restaurants philosophy is back to basics with a menu structured around appreciating every fresh ingredient one option was a wild game burger this days choice kangaroo served with a tomato aioli now i have never tasted kangaroo but i am always open to trying a new taste they import their kangaroo from new zealand and serve it along with other wild game including camel and elk the kangaroo burger was outstanding cooked perfectly and serve on a toasted bun imprinted with a b g instantly you know it is not a beef burger with the distinct wild flavor much like a venison burger but earthier the homemade fries were crispy and just the way i like them dora here it was the day for trying new things all around topped with feta cheese and served with curry aioli the lamb burger couldve passed for beef im not sure if thats good or bad for lamb lovers i just know that i enjoyed the lean smoky flavor and im a huge fan of feta i tried the aoili but preferred it without and im with ernie the fries were perfect service was attentive and for the most part quick and the wait staff helpful and knowledgeable just a note when you order unique options they tend to be a bit pricier dora here gulp youre not kidding two burgers one iced tea and no appetizers yowzee better save up your pennies as i was saying dont let that discourage you go for it we rate this restaurant forks out of for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food ernie dora hiers fiction faith foodies blog you cant mess with their short ribs best item on the menu bar none this place set the bar on grits for me too im a yankee and has thus ruined me for grits eaten pretty much anywhere else excellent drinks too the emphasis at block grinder is definitely on quality and seasonality they clearly take pride in their menu the one thing i would say is that the service level among staff isnt completely consistent some servershosts are definitely friendlier and more polished than others but i still love going here we also bought really pricey fair warning tenderloin steaks for christmas dinner from b g and they were maybe the best ive ever had a great spot for a quality meal and for quality meat youll make at home for those occasions where you want to splash out and be fancy about it had a great experience at block grinder both the food and service were phenomenal in my first visit here the food we started with the deviled egg appetizer which came out as five deviled egg halves the filling was great it had a good mustard flavor with a hint of goat cheese that they put in the prosciutto on top was perfect it added a little saltiness and meaty flavor to the deviled eggs and was just the right size to add flavor but not overpower for my entree i ordered their beef burger with ny cheddar medium rare i thought about trying the game burger of the day kangaroo but decided to stick with beef since it was my first time here definitely thinking of branching out next time i was very happy to be able to order a burger as rare as i want because most places offer medium at best and even cook that a bit more than they should not with block grinder this burger had a nice pink center it was super juicy and it was seasoned well but also maintained great meaty flavor the patty was just a little smaller than expected but quality over quantity was fine in this case for me my girlfriend ordered the pork belly pancakes as her entree and they were a pile of pork fat goodness the pork belly had incredible flavor and was extremely tender but the pancakes and slaw were great as well the slaw was sweet but with just a hint of vinegar and the pancakes were soft but didnt get mushy under all the juices either we shared a side of mac cheese with our entrees as well no surprise at this point it was great the corkscrew noodles were perfectly al dente and the cheese sauce was awesome it was buttery and really cheesy compared to most restaurants mac cheese which was great because more cheese always better the few breadcrumbs on top were a nice touch as well we finished off the meal with the hot fudge sundae it had salted caramel ice cream which i enjoyed despite not liking caramel much and came with hot fudge candied pecans a cherry and was served in a bacon bowl yes that is correct they turn bacon into a paste add some brown sugar and maple syrup or other sweet goodness and bake it into a bowl the bacon bowl was good although not my favorite but the candied pecans were awesome very cool and pretty tasty dessert overall the service was stellar as well our server chris was really knowledgeable about the menu and was even nice enough to point out the favorites on the menu and the items that were less liked they change their menu every few weeks since theyre farm to table and stop serving things that guests dont love which i think is awesome our drinks were consistently refilled and we were checked on constantly but not so much that it was an annoyance or interrupted conversation the portions were good the prices werent bad and both the food and service really blew me away this was our third visit to block grinder the first two were definitely star the entire wait staff was extremely friendly and helpful as usual from the moment we entered the door until we left we were well taken care of my wife and i split the hudson valley foie gras appetizer even though extremely small the quality was excellent we then each had a boston wedge each was superb as usual with the house cured bacon exceptional my wife ordered the filet mignon medium rare upon arrival the meat was not recognizable as filet mignon and was extremely rare trying to cut the steak she found the meat very tough i ordered the bacon cured salmon the presentation was beautiful the taste was terrible as if the meat had been fermented we will go back but sincerely hope the owners read and take to heart reviews like this this was our first time here but our second attempt trying to eat here our first attempt was on a sunday a couple months ago around pm and it was closed like seriously who closes early on a sunday only in charlotte anyhow finally got to try this place and i really dont know what the hyped is all about my boyfriend had an elk burger and i had the hanger steak the only two things that stood out to us was how salty our meals were and to to add cheddar cheese to the burger was and bacon another really for each add on what ever happen to add ons all in for a burger plus tax and i was not a fan of the cornmeal pancakes with the hanger steak it just didnt work for me but on the plus side the service was great our server matthew was really friendly and dessert was our favorite part the peach crisp was pretty yummy one of the top restaurants in charlotte hands down maybe even our favorite but its just so hard to pick the pork belly small plate is a must all of their meats are locally sourced and always perfectly seasoned and cooked sides are well thought out and complement the main without fail i love their wild game specials things like venison and boar shine great beer and wine selection excellent desert even their coffee french press is to die for have wanted to check this place out for a long time so glad we did we didnt have a reservation so we sat at the bar very cordial service good wine and beer selection we were quickly seated in the dining room cool vibe fairly small lots of noise but a great view of the kitchen we started with three appetizers deviled eggs the scallops and an order of the fois gras all three were good but the deviled eggs were a step above with the goat cheese giving them a tart creaminess for dinner we had the halibut special with mushroom risotto and the game burger special kangaroo both were excellent well prepared generous portions and tasty apparently i like kangaroo meat who knew overall this place is similar to roosters which is a very good thing i look forward to going back again by far the best meal ive had in ages our waiter savvas was one of the nicest fellows imaginable our party of three was catered to very well we told him of an allergy that a member of our party had and he went above and beyond to make sure every measure was taken for her after our meal we were greeted by the chef who was exceptional nice great experience will definitely eat there many times in the future we are already planning a small party to be had there great restaurant highly recommend it food is amazing customer service is equally as good the best short rib sandwiches in town server was knowledgable prompt attentive and a real nice guy suggested the blt since were near the end of season for tomatoes but we came for the short rib if youve not had it youve not lived its that good they have their own butcher shop that looks outstanding will try that on our next visit among the many choices in this part of the queen city this ranks in the top five the service and ambience was excellent the reason i have three stars was based on the brunch menu the duck hash and the shrimp and grits were pricy for the portion sizes my other friend had the basic breakfast which had more bang for your buck i would like to visit this restaurant for dinner though again excellent service very good very pricey i had the burger which was very good but it was like which is too much for a burger in my opinion also had the pork belly which was amazing and only cost go figure i will be back but unfortunately this place is too expensive to go all the time i was sad to be underwhelmed by this place the spinach salad was fabulous the first one ive ever had that came with sweet things e g candied pecans and goat cheese and was not covered in absurd amounts of them what disappointed me was the service and the standard burger the burger seemed salted only on one side and the other had very little flavor at all there was also a lot of gristle in the burger and it was very tough it was not overcooked medium well so i dont know why it was so tough the service disappointed me in that the burger was just plunked down and the salad plate not removed so i had to maneuver things myself the waitress also seemed kind of checked out which was weird the host was great though i would come back to try some other things and for the salad but not for the burger i was there last week and i must say i had one the best steaks of my life it was a prime rib eye and it was perfect i also order a side of the pomme frits equally fantastic we just bought a place in charlotte and will certainly make block grinder a regular dinner choice cant forget the service was excellent i went in super excited about grass fed beef lol this place is rude the waitress was slack she left us feeling abandoned the food was extremely disappointing again the burger was and more to add anything to it for it shouldnt look like a kids meal the regular fries were under cooked and greasy i sent my burnt sweet potato fries back and got a snotty reply from the chief sent out they were charred lol charred would have soft fluffy potato inside not about to break my teeth the steak was ok but again way overpriced the quality is not there this was my second time trying to eat here both very unpleasant our food did not look like the pictures showed i have been to block and grinder a few times before but have never been as satisfied as i have been with its food and service as my most recent visit we were seated quickly on a friday night without reservations our waitress was very knowledgeable of the menu and helpful with suggestions for food and drink we started off with the pork belly which i would recommend everyone who visits order the pork was so tender and just oozing with flavor just thinking of it now is making me salivate it was accompanied with slaw and pancakes which were very good as well my husband and i were also very impressed by the portion that was served for the price for my main course i had the hanger steak and garlic mashed potatoes after having a not so well cooked steak at a mediocre chain restaurant the week before this is exactly what i needed to finally satisfy my steak craving my steak was cooked perfectly medium rare juicy and well seasoned no complaints about the arugula salad or potatoes either the star of the whole night for me actually sat on my husbands plate he ordered the pork chop with brussel sprouts and bone marrow bread pudding yes the pork chop was delicious but oh my goodness the bone marrow bread pudding amazing its essentially stuffing and while this seems so basic it was so so good i could not help but go back for a third and fourth taste i was too full for dessert but i will definitely be back soon to try the butterscotch pot de creme i did indulge in a cocktail my waitress recommended the kentucky corpse reviver she described it as interesting but in a good way and after taking a sip i knew what she meant unique in its blend of flavors but very fresh and citrusy chef ben also came to ask us about our meal after i raved over his food he shared that the simple trick to their recipes was simply using great local ingredients all in all i cant wait to come back again lamb burgers were amazing service was excellent we where impressed with the teamwork between wait staff any one passing by our table would clear used dishes without even slowing down great job food perfection the staff and kitchen love food and know they have people coming in who love food its just damn good food go there and thank me later perfect place amazing steaks great atmosphere fun loud great wait staff i could eat there everyday pricey but worth it if youre looking for an ostrich burger this place is the spot truth is though why pay for a dry medium ostrich burger when you can get a delicious greasy beef burger from anywhere for bucks if ostrich is your thing sure but think theres a reason this country produces so much beef it tastes better than anything else one of the top restaurants in charlotte hands down maybe even our favorite but its just so hard to pick the pork belly small plate is a must all of their meats are locally sourced and always perfectly seasoned and cooked sides are well thought out and complement the main without fail i love their wild game specials things like venison and boar shine great beer and wine selection excellent desert even their coffee french press is to die for so ive been to block and grinder times now and each time i have such high hopes only to be disappointed once again i love the location i love the concept the food is so so and the service horrible the first time was with another couple there were of us the bar service was stupid slow and none of finished our dinners no one asked us whats wrong or if we liked our meal and it took them min to bring our check the second time i went with women again the bar service was slow the bartender focused on chatting it up with a waitress instead of bringing us drinks then he looked at us strange when asked for a second drink almost like we bothering him the third and lets note my final was new years eve we chose it because it was in our neighborhood and we could get a large party home with one driver and a minivan the sat us an hour late then one waiter for people the restaurant was not busy but no one helped our waiter with us until i asked the second bartender for some more water he jumped in to get us more drinks and was super nice the manager chatted it up the wait staffs in the kitchen area people stood in the kitchen area chatting while guys worked then to make matters worse they hadnt brought us the check but started turning up the lights in the restaurant because they close at lets note they didnt seat us until i dont recommend dont waste your money by far the worst experience ive had at a restaurant in charlotte i witnessed various appalling health code violations and the food is sub par at best it tries to be chic with its butcherrestaurant concept but wholeheartedly fails at both avoid this place at all costs i have never been disappointed by the drinks or food the appetizers are delicious and have amazing flavor the pork belly is cooked perfectly and the deviled eggs have a perfect twist all of the mixed drinks are made with care the bartenders truly know what they are doing farm to table restaurant and butcher shop serving up delicious plates this has been on my list for a while now so when my boyfriend brought me here for my birthday dinner i was super excited we started off with the pork belly its crispy get portion size and delicious get it get it the slaw is paired perfectly on the cornmeal pancake my mouth is watering just thinking about it for dinner i had the hanger steak with sweet fries it was cooked perfectly per my request and wedge style of fries my favorite dessert for the birthday girl was expresso creme brulee i will be back i must try the deviled eggs with prosciutto and their brunch menu looks fantastic place is a rip off tries to be a trendy organic food spot but fails terribly i ordered the lobster mac and cheese as it came highly recommended and it turned out to be a bowl of bland noodles with barely any cheese burger was sub par and the deviled eggs were the worst ive ever had made better deviled eggs with my grandma when i was i am not a giant fan of burgers but my husband is this was a compromise for us because we are definitely foodies and i could be accused of being a bit of a food snob i cannot express enough how awesome this place is from the cleanliness of the open kitchen floor plan the excellent wine selection superior service and knowledgeability of the staff dont even get me started on the quality of food excellent choice five stars no doubt i love love love their cocktail selection here great spot to stop after work for drinks and a bite to eat pretty disappointed heard really good things about this place we got the special elk burger and it literally was meat on a bun with some aioli and it was thats like nyc prices our service justin was awesome and hooked us up with a desert but i dont think we will be back block and grinder is one of my favorite lunch spots its not crazy busy in the costwold area ive never been for dinner their burgers are great and they always have a exotic meat to try out elk bison venison etc get their fries they wont disspoint for lunch its a little on the pricey side but the quality of the meats is good one of my favorites is the bone marrow side its a heart attack on a plate its basically meat butter but if you like that sort of thing its one of the best of the few ive had in charlotte the service is attentive nothing outside of the ordinary but solid quick recap might be my favorite restaurant in charlotte nothing short of amazing phenomenal steak incredible sides genuine and knowledgable service the pork belly was amazing full of flavor and well cooked the lamb appetizer was also incredible the filet minion was perfectly cooked and full of flavor it melted in my mouth absolutely the best steak ive had anywhere wild mushrooms were full of favor and was enough to share the same with the mashed potatoes the fries were good but if i had to recommend a side stuck with the mushrooms or mashed potatoes got an old fashioned and it was perfectly prepared if i had any sort of complaint it would be that this place is too small i wish they could seat more people bc this place is popular and its popular for a reason impeccable thanks but no thanks attended their brunch on a sunday service was slow on drinks food from the kitchen came out on time and looked good but plates were just put infant of anyone so we all ended up switching to who had what correctly on our own we were rarely checked on and no water glasses refilled unless we asked sometimes more than once when it came time for the bill we waited what seemed like eternity for them to split the bill and return food presentation was good taste was alright but ive had better best tip about this place the drinks and mimosas are awfully small for the cost i thought also the entire front has blacked out cover im guess for when it is raining or bad weather which it was not that day it was actually quite sunny making it challenging in finding the actual entrance point fabulous a true farm to table concept that felt like i was sitting in napa not the middle of suburban charlotte i made a reservation in advance but the place was dead on a sunday night we got to pick our own seat which was nice and our waitress was immediately attentive and helpful i went with the ny strip and had the butter wilted spinach and mac and cheese sides the steak was delicious and a large ounce portion the standout item was definitely the mac and cheese to die for i promise cant wait to be back to try the burgers and brunch easily entering my top restaurants in charlotte after just one visit pork belly unreal had an amazing prime ny strip with bourbon butter jam phenomenal we went to block grinder on valentines day weekend we had a reservation so no problems getting seated we ordered the pork belly pancakes as our appetizer and they were phenomenal id go back just to have those again i ordered the special cut and tiger prawns which i highly recommend if it is ever offered as a special again i cant wait to go back and try one of their burgers excellent on all counts the pork belly is not to be missed will start working our way through the rest of the menu on future visits best burger ive ever had the classic house burger had more favor then i have ever experienced as a burger my boyfriend and i definitely will be going back because we day dream about the burgers he got a spicy special burger and really enjoyed it also their cocktails are amazing my parents were in town for easter weekend but being new ish to the area i didnt know where to take them i asked around the office and someone suggested the liberty but while looking up the liberty on yelp i found block grinder and im so glad i did after seeing reviews and pictures on yelp we started with the pork belly pancakes my sister and i are both super picky and we enjoyed these four of the five of us got burgers two regular and two specials which was elk and they were fantastic very big my mom got a fried chicken which was fantastic its not your typical super heavy fried chicken dish highly recommend although we were stuffed we got the ice cream sundae and bread pudding so good as we left my boyfriend turned to me and said i think this is the best restaurant weve eaten at since moving we will definitely be back very high quality ingredients and competent chef skills are apparent service mediocre to annoying prices fair for burgers high for entrees such as for a strip steak plus for a salad plus for a side menu for meat lovers love chef ben best burger in charlotte love the drinks and food try the trout house made bacon my husband and i came for the sunday brunch and it was so worth it the pressed coffee is so great i had the special which was a frittata and stone ground grits and my husband had the arugula poached eggs and pork then we were too early for a bloody mary so we tried the cinnamon rolls um wow service was fantastic parking can be scary but we will definitely be back great service their spicy margarita is awesome had the fried oysters pork belly and burgers nice meat selection ive been wanting to try this place for a while glad i finally came on a pretty quiet friday evening my server matt was extremely attentive and gracious i think sometimes single diners get overlooked i ordered the lamb burger that he misheard as regular upon receipt he practically insisted on making the right thing i appreciated that to drink i had the gin smash you should have one too it was equal parts strong and flavorful next i let my server recommend a nice dry red he nailed it to eat i had the lamb burger it was flavorful with feta cheese and i added bacon it was a little dry but i also ordered medium well potentially would have been more moist cooked medium overall i really like this place i think i may have found a new perfect workhangout spot close to home ive only eaten here once very nice restaurant with delicious burgers a bit pricey though our burgers with cheese and fresh cut fries with tea came to nearly there are just as great burgers in town for a lot less not saying i wont go back maybe when i have out of town guests but for a casual lunch i prefer not to spend that much i really wasnt expecting much of block grinder when i was decided to stop by for dinner to be honest but they really blew me away i was a bit early for my dinner date and decided to wait at my table instead of sitting at the bar when my waiter came around he asked if id like to wait before ordering drinks or if id like one ahead of time how considerate finally my fellow diner arrived and we got some nifty drink recommendations from our waiter who also happened to be the bar manager he really knows his stuff and actually made some of the cocktails on the menu ill have to visit and try more sometime libations taken care of we decided to order some foie gras and roasted bone marrow to start with the foie gras was beautifully presented the only problem i had with this was that it was a very sweet dish overall with the buttered soldier on the bottom soaking up all that port reduction thankfully the charred nature of the foie gras helped tone it down a bit the bone marrow was a big hit the luxurious fatty marrow was served with a generous topping of arugula pesto to help cut the richness while the foie gras had the problem of being too salty this one had the unfortunate problem of being a bit too salty so had to be topped sparingly on our bread though they did an excellent job of tempering the funk that can sometimes be associated with marrow bones for the main course i was recommended the rack of lamb with wild ramps and a mushroom farro which i was leaning towards over the short rib i am glad i did i loved it it was nicely presented and when our waiter had heard that i am a big fan of ramps he had asked the kitchen to have some extra ramps added to the dish for me my lamb was perfectly cooked how i asked for it medium rare and in contrast to the appetizers perfectly seasoned usually ill take a bite then give an opinion in this instance i just took a bite and smiled enjoying the food all the flavors in this dish worked well together with the tomato gastrique brightening up the earthiness of the mushroom farro and the ramps stringent onion flavors adding complexity to the bites of lamb for dessert my dining companion opted for a glass of champagne while i opted out however our thoughtful waiter brought out some ginger ale in a champagne glass so i didnt just awkwardly sit there if i had to judge them solely on their food it would probably be stars however the service here really bumped it up a notch thanks for the excellent dinner block and grinder had a craving for a burger and not just any burger something gourmet bg was it the choices of all style of food is unreal i had the cajun bison burger wife had the signature son had the wild game burger of the day which was kangaroo of all things and my daughter had the sliders all were prepared perfect and all tasted great the dessert didnt stink either and i love restaurants with a coffee press which is what we had just be careful about pricing which was my only reason for giving it versus stars its up there price wise however it was worth it the chef came around to talk to every table and our waitress was spot on star food and service but again dont forget it will cost you but i cant wait to go back steak steak steak delicious steak great atmosphere for a date night cocktails are on point all in caps best restaurant in charlotte read again best restaurant in charlotte i was already a big fan of bg at providence rd i went for a dinner event prior to opening and i can tell it was one of the best meals we have ever had in life the location is a lot larger than the original one features a larger butcher shop and a chefs table chef ben was absolutely on fire tonight and nailed every single dish we ordered the duck among other dishes and the duck was so delicious that it out beat one we had in paris the restaurant is very well located into the langtree shopping center which is by the lake and features incredible views of lake norman if you come here i would suggest that you order the pork belly the duck and the bread pudding for dessert the wine list is quite interesting and i would suggest the block and tackle absolutely outstanding wine service is also spectacular we definately needed a good quality restaurant here in this area we have a few that call themselves fine dining but they are nothing but overrated see my other reviews for these places around here if you are looking for the best meal of your life you have come to the right place pretty legit we went opening night and the service and food were great the sides were a bit small considering the price i thought they would be more family size my burger was cooked very nicely and the pommel frites were tasty as well as portioned well i also had a side of brussels that were good if you dont like bacon or cant have pork you may need to ask for some cooked differently my boyfriend had a strip that was very flavorful the mashed potatoes were good but small and much colder than the rest of the meal dessert was something id never had before basically their play on the ice cream sandwich well definitely be back best burger in charlotte and awesome bar lake norman just got a gem in this place langtree chef ben and chef ethan rule block and grinder has the best burgers in town i always add a duck egg to mine all the sides are fresh and delicious beer choice is limits but the selection is stellar ive only gone to dinner but im sure their lunch is good too this is the best food ive had in my visits to charlotte everything was amazingly good and we are major foodies the deviled eggs who orders them right well these were amazing with goat cheese as part of the blend the fried oysters were very good also wines for price a glass were a good deal too do we decided to share of the duck pan fried with fingerling potatoes arugula and orange vinaigrette excellent and the other was the best burger ive ever had ground fresh here with fabulously perfect fries on a toasted brioche super yum for dessert the apple bread pudding with burnout caramel sauce was perfection if i lived in charlotte id become a regular for sure i cant get enough of this place i have to agree with the other reviewer best restaurant in charlotte we have been here three times and everything i have had has been great my husband is more adventurous than i am and has tried the camel steak and the boar steak both he absolutely loved will definitely return this place omg love you forever block and grinder i grew up in a co op farm community now i work in community service begging for veggies and playing chef every week at the community cafe all for free my life revolves around food i have to say eating at bg was an absolute time warp treat the adult in me was completely satisfied but that kid who grew up farming was ecstatic ive never left a meal so happy from my field green salad and venison burger to my unreal espresso creme brulee i was just done i loved the vibe here and the fact it is also a butcher shop i lived ordering several of the small appetizers to share and the beef was delicious i will definitely return here a great add to lake norman as good or better than the usual suspects kindred epic fork dressers mooch caruso kinda foodie farm table but laid back enough to enjoy good service and great set up inside craft beers cocktails and some kind of great food for all worth a visit this restaurant and butcher prides itself on farm to table ingredients and all natural organic meats and wild game the service is good their specialty is meat and they know how to cook it really well however you like it the pork belly small plate pork belly cubes glazed in a bourbon and sorghum sauce on top of cornmeal pancakes is a must have appetizer to start your night off they are also known for their delicious deviled eggs in terms of entrees i really like their duck the reason my rating isnt stars is because i find their duck a bit more fatty than i would like and their pork chop is very tasty not worth the money i can get much better food else where for cheaper and more inviting atmosphere went here last night and wow the burger i had which was the bg was soo tasty i tasted my friends steak and it melted in my mouth it was sooo great also tasted the mac and cheese it was divine it was some of the best that i have had in a long time the reason i didnt give a full stars is cause i was not a fan of the fries just not my cup of tea and i understand they only use whats in season but i really wanted some asparagus and they didnt have any ive always gone for lunch to this place and ive loved it last week we went for dinner and i have to say it wasnt up to par i might need to go again for good measure though went on a saturday night and it was packed there were lots of reservations but also lots of walkups so the place was in the weeds though the service was good the servers were a little too busy for my taste ie waters went unfilled for a while cocktails were good and they have a good selection of wines by the glass all of the food was good but it lacked some quality and execution the pork belly was extremely good but there were a couple of pieces that were all fat not good the tartare had good flavors and a nice presentation but it was pre made so the meat was brown until you got to the very center and we got a few crostini that were over toasted so it gave a bitter flavor to the dish the meats were spot on good cooked to perfection and of very good choice quality there were no complaints there my favorite side the bone marrow was also on point the desserts were ok nothing to write home about the ice cream side had the best flavor and texture the bread pudding was a little dry and hard for my liking great food but horrible service never have i ever been so offended when wanting to spend money it was like we werent good enough for the server ignored us all night cut us off mutliple times when ordering our meal even though we were ordering more food never once did he refill our waters left our drinks at the bar multiple times while cleaning tables and the restaurant was half empty we left an hour before the olace even closed too many good restaurants in charlotte to go back to a place where the staff is too good for simple courtsey i mean come on if youre going to talk negatively about a table at least do it where they cant hear you they lost my business my familys business my friends business and my companys business}

{563, Ritters Diner, 5221 Baum Blvd Bloomfield Pittsburgh PA 15224, come for the drama between the waitresses in nurse scrubs stay for the food all the drunk people are an added bonus what a great diner no matter who you are your name is always hon and you food is always greasy tastic mmm grease tastic the fact that the ownermanager looks just like ted dansons old coach from cheers is tremendous i really wanted to give this a great review because i have very fond memories of this place when i was a kid with my mom and also when i was in my early s hitting this place after am alas i went there this morning and found out it really is just your typical greek diner with a giant menu i give it kudos for the jukebox on the tables sopranos finale style and i thought our server was great she easily had been doing this for years the atmosphere is good just like any other diner you would go too i was here this morning with my friend fiona and we both needed a hearty breakfast to help with our recovery from the prior night the coffee was good and plentiful we never had less than half a cup i had two poached eggs and white toast the eggs were poached perfectly and the bread was appropriately soaked with butter all in all this was pretty good my bacon was also fine with three healthy strips however fiona was less lucky she had a veggie omelette which was average at best size doesnt matter with respect to omelettes id rather less eggs but super beaten so the omelette is light the veggies were plentiful but id prefer the veggies lightly sauteed so texturely there isnt such a difference from the eggs to the vegetables the sausage was good but cold she asked for crispy bacon and it wasnt crispy at all in fact it was exactly the same doneness as mine the homefries were okay but i prefer a little more crust on the potatoes id say this is a perfectly acceptable diner but id recommend youll enjoy your meal much better if its at am in the morning as opposed to am on a saturday when most of your whits are about you and your palate is not dulled from the tequila great place to go if you need grease and carbs to soak up all of the drinking youve been doing many a late night was spent eating grilled cheese with tomato on rye and fries and only a few nights in the parking lot hanging onto the light pole for dear life while hurling up that last stoli v and ginger a great place to be drunk in not so great to be hung over in they have your typical greasy spoon fare so dont go if youre concerned about your health otherwise eat on brave soul eat on ritters can best be described as classic i have been avoiding this place because the last time i was here it was smoking and this place was a smokey diner but on sunday we wanted breakfast and it was after pm so ritters was really the only choice glad i returned much better that i remember this is a diner with diner food and diner prices but i still think it deserves starts because it does a great job of just being ritters i could reiterate why it is a classic but the other reviews do a great job of detailing why ritters is ritters ive only been here after am and its always been a flaming trainwreck of an experience ive had to figure out if the waitresses were doing this as a halfway house job ive had staff members not apologize while picking pieces of steel wool and green plastic scrubber out of my food and ive witnessed an armed robbery the food is decent for the hours theyre open try toms diner or eat n park instead heck go to a grocery store instead i dont know what it is certainly not the food but i love this place perhaps its the individual juke boxes the pie the sassy waitresses the hour availability or the fact that everything here seems to be a hang over cure but i just can not get enough i used to live up the street from here and this was definitely my weekend morning hot spot the food is pretty standard diner food ive never come here late at night and probably wouldnt want to but in the mornings ritters is definitely a fantastic spot a pittsburgh classic many many late nights have i spent here post strike party or any other type party eating the grease necessary to fight off the hangover i deserved the next day the waitresses are part of the ambiance love their reuben okay the food isnt wonderful but its pretty good and its cheap i must admit i always stick with the breakfast y menu items but im such a fan of this place you gotta appreciate ritters being open hours where else in pittsburgh can you go at am and get some comfort food or something to sober you up ive been here at all hours of the day and the crowd is always interesting and so are the waitresses ah i love it theres just something special about ritters five adults including three not small men piled into a honda civic on the way to breakfast one saturday morning this had better be good i thought as we bumped along ritters is a good place to go when other highly attended brunch locales are going through their mid morning rush as it has two large dining areas to seat customers you will definitely get seated and served faster the food was good better than the crappy dinner experience i thought i was going to receive as ritters just kind of exudes a here i am take it or leave it diner kind of vibe it wasnt amazing but it was good also i paid for three of the breakfasts myself and the two larger of the men and somehow none of us went hungry and the bill was just and some change for three people i even had some food left on my plate our server wasnt awesome she was clearly unhappy to be receiving another table im not assuming i overheard her say it to another server however she got the job done i suppose in terms of water glass refill ritters is cash only so make sure you bring yours or someone else who wants to buy you breakfast ritters is for me the definition of a diner if you go early an old grandmother will serve up a sloppy egg breakfast on plates that you cant be sure if theyve been washed more than twice go late night and you can join drunk college kids and the ladies of the evening just be warned that someone may have painted a section of the restroom with a fine layer of regergitated food hey is that creamed corn say what you will about ritters it is a place full of character and full of characters not to be missed quintessential diner complete with in booth mini jukeboxes waitresses in diner aprons and cheap good simple food go early go late go real late its always open located on the borders of shadyside south oakland friendship and bloomfield it serves the likes of college students as well as the eldery used to live around the corner from it and went weekly conveniently across the street from upmc shadyside hospital great service and down home atmosphere is hard to beat had the liver and onions which came with choice of potatoes veggies and a hard roll normal person portions and with a coffee came to less than ten bucks food wasnt anything to right home about but a nice experience convenient location and open hours cash only but there is an atm machine rittes is a classic old style diner in the shadyside neighborhood of pittsburgh it has great diner food and of course great breakfast it has been a well know sober up place for years hour diner the food isnt overwhelmingly good its been around for a long time anytime is a good time to eat there go after and watch the drunks stumble through their meal go in the morning and catch some early birds or old regulars scarfind down a cheap breakfast the servers are as pleasant as one can be when working at a hour diner its near upmc shadyside located close enough to oakland and right by bloomfield this is a nice dive diner great if you need food in the middle the night it definitely has a kitschy old school ambiance perfect for the hipster set or the actual old school set the side salad that came before the entree was regrettable and superfluous though i wasnt expecting much in the first place it was definitely pre mixed long before we arrived which wouldnt have been bad except they also mix in the croutons were become gross and soggy after sitting in a bowl of salad my fried chicken was excellent perfectly crisp with a great batter and not too salty i had home fries on the side which were well cooked but very much under seasoned the service was rather basic and inattentive but you cant expect much more from a place like this all in all we enjoyed our visit and well be back when we need some late night comfort food this place lives up to the true old diner standard with friendly waitresses who call everyone hon jukeboxes at each table and greasy spoon food that arrives at the table mere moments after its ordered regardless of the time of day i visit ive always eaten breakfast at ritters and its always been good around am the after bar crowd shows up and around am the plumbers and handymen arrive its always people watching time at ritters the food isnt something to rave about but its edible i love the fact that they offer fried green tomatoes and grape leaves i have only been to critters for late night munchies and that also happens to be when pittsburghs finest come out to play never a dull moment i used to live around the corner from this place and worked across the street at the hospital ritters is a great greasy spoon diner with adorable vintage juke boxes at the booths waitresses who have been there forever and patrons who have been lifers as well its certainly not a place to go for health food or fine cuisine but its great breakfast food and even greater place to be for late night after the bar drinking ill be the first to admit dont come here for the food it is not for those with delicate sensibilities or a snobbish palate that said i love ritters its a pittsburgh classic my parents used to eat here and is pretty much the standard place to go after emerging from an east end dive bar covered in sweat and cigarette smoke drunk and seeking some greasy awfulness the clientele can get belligerent but i think this is all part of the fun its a den of shame bask in it put something on the jukebox and relax or dont go here my friend and i came around one night to grab a bite to eat the diner was pretty empty and we were seated next to a couple who could speak russian spanish and english vanderful this place does serve the typical diner food and with a decent quality actaully the server i wish i had gotten her name but im sure shes the main one there was extremely friendly saying youre welcome every time i said thank you and making sure that our water cups remained full when i ordered my burger that ordinarily came with fries i was telling my friend that i was craving hash browns so when i ordered a side of hash browns she kindly offered me to allow me to substitute my fries for their hash browns it was wonderful we looked through their jukebox playlist and there were quite a few good tunes available albeit it costs cents a play i think which is very very pricey for a jukebox our food came out quickly the receipt was given to us at the table and we went up to pay i left a tip at the cashier who immediately called the waitress over who took it and said thank you to us stars for the food stars for the wonderfully courteous staff yes i know that it doesnt add up to but so much the better finding a good ol diner in pittsburgh isnt exactly easy pamelas has great breakfast but is in no sense a diner and there are many good sandwich shops but once again they arent diners having only been there once so far my review may be a little skewed the restaurant has the diner feel no doubt there are jukebox machines at every table up front and the decorations harken to the setting of a greasy spoon restaurant it was busy when we went so the food took a while the wait seemed longer than it should have been but as i said the place was packed and it was exactly lunchtime on the menu it stated that they used premium maple syrup but im pretty sure i just got corn syrup in a cup the coffee was somewhat watery but still alright i ordered the french toast with eggs and bacon all of which was rather bland except the bacon a meat which has some inherent godliness to it you cant mess it up basically it seemed like a meal i could have whipped up lazily on my own and in less time the bread for the french toast was plain white toast and i normally prefer a better bread the eggs were eggs good without any pizzazz while ritters is cheap from my small sampling i found the food boring most good diners have some excellent menu item and perhaps i drew the short straw i might return to ritters later but its certainly not the diner im looking for was in the neighborhood and decided to stop at ritters for a late breakfast parking isnt fun since its either on wild baum blvd or parking in the ritters cramped lot across from the diner we hit the crowd but were seated in under minutes the waitress was friendly even though she was keeping up with a few other tables in the section i got the new greek gyro omelete which was good the homefries were standard potatoes a little bland but okay the vanilla milkshake was great and was exactly what youd find in an old diner the wait for the food wasnt too bad considering the crowd size and the food was good nothing too extraordinary great place to go at am when your hammered and just want some food ritters only takes cash and the service can be extremely terrible sometimes however they are open hours and will serve you breakfast i think theyve seen enough of their share of drunken idiots like us that theyre used to it by now oh did i mention that they are open hours awesome at am on a weekend night the clientele is colorful the service friendly and the food well just forget about the food the food ranges from mediocre to bland just be grateful there is a colorful place to go for a late night meal good drunk food even better hangover food sweet scrubs on the waitresses cash only also once this other guy eating at the bar gave me a free magazine about criminals from the s in other words quality people ritters is amazing for what it is a big greek ish old fashioned greasy spoon diner with a lot of character granted i have been and will only go here for a weekend breakfast or maybe i would go after a night of drinking since it is open hours it is also walking distance from my house so that makes me a little bias i always order a greek omelet of some sort and eat half of it and am stuffed so take the other half home the servers have all been there for awhile im sure but are still friendly and not too bitter ok greasy spoon diner especially because i can walk there i have grown to love thee always spot on always a seat no wait really have been going there a ton as of late and cannot complain the bill is always under bux for people oh local greasy spoon im so torn on how to write this review if i were reviewing you on the atmosphere alone you would definitely get a big hefty stars the people watching is second to none and at any time of day since youre open the staff is probably a as ive had less than stellar service here on more than one occasion the food hmmm well its dinner food the breakfast is right on par with what one would expect from a diner like this its far from good for you and generally sits in your gut like a cinder block its not bad by any means though also you only take cash and have one of the shadiest atm machines ive ever seen im going to go with a middle ground dear ritters diner and give you a stars youre local youre not a disgusting chain restaurant and youve always been pretty good to me this is an institution i hit the counter with a minutes window ordered two eggs over hash browns and dry rye min later bingo and the hot sauce was waiting i llike the greek items the cheap prices and the open hours the cranky servers are the best and worst of pittsburgh any establishment thats open hours gets bonus points in my book its my firm opinion that any business that serves customers on a walk in basis should be open i mean yeah theres that circadian rhythm thing that keeps every business from having the graveyard shift but im sure were only a couple decades away from curing the need for sleep point is ritters is hours and as a result its been a standby ever since i moved into town the food at ritters is definitely better than what youll get at a dennys or a kings it isnt top shelf artisan food but it is pretty good diner food ritters is also a great place to go hang out with a few friends late at night and bs over coffee when youre just not feeling going to a bar and blowing mad cash on drinks or for stopping by after youve already blown your mad drink cash the waitresses are nice the fellah who usually rings us out was really rude to me at least once i think he was the owner or manager or something too but im not really sure the place is cash only too which sucks however the fact that theyre cash only leads to a really encouraging story about the place one time the atm did something wacky and i thought i may have been charged without having received my cash the waitress took down my name and phone number which i thought was just to get me to stop complaining but sure enough someone called me the next day and gave me the run down on what had happened id call that good service if its late and youre peckish dont forget that ritters is open worst food in pittsburgh thats all i have been there twice never my choice i had tummy ache both times i think the food is boring dont get me wrong i have no problem with non gourmet food but ritters is just blah it also was an unclean feel at times when you are seated and you look around they are cash only also that doesnt both me at pamelas because the food is oh so delish here you are just wasting you apetite on food that has tons of rooms for improvement i live off of liberty ave and everyone kept telling me i needed to try this place so after months i did when my wife and i walked in i thought this place doesnt look too bad actually kinda cool wrong after being seated it probably took minutes for the waitress to come over and another minutes for our coffee to get to the table our food took about minutes which is absolutely ridiculous for standard breakfast but i though everyone thinks this place is great i guess i can wait for perfection the food gets to our table it looks good it looks like breakfast but it is cold well mine was cold so im sitting at the table empty coffee cold breakfast and quite pissed off because of the situation and im hungry finally after about minutes the waitress comes by and asks how everything is i tell her my food is cold and im fine and dont need another plate we had already been there over an hour we had placed to go ya know when the waitress brings the bill over she doesnt just tell me she took my food off she says i figured i would take the food off even though you didnt ask really should i have to wifes food was hot but she thought it to be just average breakfast i never want to go back but i will because i always give places another shot terribly slow service server was very nice though probably home from college and food took forever i doubt this place puts out cold food on a regular basis because this place wouldnt be so packed and highly regarded its hard not to give this place and extra star just for sentiment honestly ritters is a favorite of mine i love diner food if youre looking for a late night drunken fourth meal this is your place if you just want a no frills greasy spoon saturday brunch ritters is there for you this place is blocks from where i live which makes it even better for me and it is open hours one of the only places in town or at least on the east end that holds that title perfect for those of us that frequent bloomfield shadyside and lawrenceville for late night fun i cant tell you how many times in group of friends looking to satisfy their drunk munchies or otherwise in the wee hours that ritters is shouted its there its open and ready to serve you anything from its extensive menu of diner food its also good anytime to go in and watch the old yinzers on a saturday morning drink their coffee read the paper and just being so pittsburgh served by waitresses in their nurse scrubs that always call you hun the food i have never had a problem with the food i love breakfast and i dont think i have gotten anything else here i think maybe my sunnyside eggs were undercooked once but that has happened to me at really nice restaurants too and eggs just seem to be something that is done wrong fairly often i think their hotcakes are pretty darn good and that is my go to meal a great hangover cure always sometimes at four in the morning you need a place to eat and for that purpose ritters does its job otherwise the food is pretty mediocre remember if you can after a long night out that this establishment is cash only you are never going to get great service here and for the most part at night when the entire place is packed full of belligerent drunks why should you the waitstaff does their job takes orders brings out the food and refills your drinks but dont expect much more and surely dont expect to have all your requests pampered i feel bad for the waitstaff who have to deal with drunks all night especially on the weekend this is a pittsburgh landmark nice diner vibe and a place where i will always have great memories though the food is pretty mediocre and slightly overpriced for the quality i will always keep coming back here out of nostalgia but i rounded down this is not a place you go to eat out but its rather a emergency stop when you have no other place to go perhaps in the morning cash only doesnt separate the check so if you are eathing with somebody else figure it out among yaselves im not a big fan of diners and havent been to one so i dont have anything to compare to but like i said if you have nowhere else to go you might try this one food is ok its like the food that a mom who doesnt care for cooking cooked i dont want to be too mean waitresses are friendly they are dressed up in scrubs like nurses i will always love this place mostly because it is one of the few places open hours a day where i can always get a bacon cheeseburger regardless of the hour the price is always right too highly recommended cash only but they do have an atm inside if you need separate checks be sure to mention it up front though our waitress was a tad rude when we asked her to split the cost at the register because she had already added it up and when she gave us change didnt even give us small bills i might have cared more if the food wasnt always so delicious we came here for a casual brunch and were pleasantly surprised service was slow as we expected but we werent really expecting much so i guess it didnt make that much of a difference they didnt have the fried green tomatoes that we wanted to try oh well the food we did get made up for our brief disappointment we had the greek hobo omelette how could you not want to try something called a greek hobo omelette with feta cheese as well as a stack of buckwheat pancakes the omelette was really flavorful and actually tasted like a greek gyro as stated in the description especially with the yummy tzatziki sauce the home fries were awesome perfectly crispy browned layer buckwheat pancakes were pretty decent as well and the syrup was nice and buttery we left glad that we had decided not to wait in line at pamelas ordered the eggs and potatoes which was only deal i asked for the eggs to be scrambled and it came with home fries and toast i know my meal wasnt that exciting and can you really mess up eggs toast or potatoes the eggs and toast were fine something i couldve made at home but the home fries left something to be desired they had no flavor its like someone boiled some potatoes and slapped them in a pan and served them on a plate i put some salt and pepper on them but it didnt really help its like the potatoes were determined to be tasteless i ate a few forkfuls and just gave up i came here for a meeting in the morning and it wasnt crowded looked like there were some regulars but fairly low key i could definitely see how peeps who come here after a night of being out im not sure that id make it a point to go to ritters unless it was a night out and i needed a place open hours they are cash only not bad not bad at all went on a late sunday morning and it seemed it would be too busy to get us in and out fast just as we were walking out the door an older gentlemen ushered us in and right to a seat the cash only sign almost scared us off anyway food is typical diner food i had a bacon egg and cheese bagel sandwich and it was fine for the price with home fries waitresses were very attenative with coffee and water refills and brought us our food quickly you cant always get nice service in busy places so that was a big plus i can tell this has been pittsburgh oldie for a while its not a new age vegan vegetarian friendly joint although several vegetarian options with egg on the omelette portion of breakfast menu also several greek american type salads and dishes gyros if youre into that if youre looking for a cheap greasy nostalgia this is it if youre seeking a spectacular garlic potato red roasted peper and asiago cheese omelette youre not gonna find it here i liked the people owner and wait staff and food is decent so i gave it four sometimes you have to know what you came for and just be happy with that i cant really give a food review since i didnt order anything but there is a reason why i didnt order anything my brother and his friends had the midnight munchies after the whole pub crawling being the responsible little sister i chaperoned the boys and went the ritters with them i wasnt in the mood to eat after midnight but thats not the reason why i didnt order anything the reason why i didnt get anything was because when we walked in the diner i looked at the variety of dishes other patrons ordered and felt slightly sick to my stomach mustve been my inner conscious that the food is bad news and i guessed correctly my brother had the arcadian burger and by sunrise his stomach didnt settle well had no desire to eat throughout the day trust your eyes nose and instinct its most likely right oh ritters id actually give this place a the food is nothing special just basic greasy diner food the rating is not for the food or for what the places looks like or feels like this rating is for what ritters represents ritters represents late nights after the bar with friends ritters represents the meal that will soak up the alcohol and save you from a wicked hangover ritters represents am with your friends not because anyone is particularly hungry for chicken tenders but because the bars are closed and no one is ready to go home quite yet the laughter and fun shared at late night at ritters can be replaced by nothing else if you are looking for awesome food you will be disappointed if you are looking for standard hour diner food and an awesome place to people watch once the bar doors close this is your place it is so awesome to see all of the club goers pile into ritters after dancing on a dark dance floor hair a mess mascara looking more like a raccoon than the model they were just a few hours ago and limping in those fierce heels they thought looked so cute when they hit the dance floor this place is an institution among those who spend their earlymid twenties in the oaklandshadysidebloomfield area if you havent spent a late night at ritters you are missing out although its called a diner its much larger than that its open and has a full menu tough to fault especially with good food do you need a place to soak up the alcohol after a long night of drinking do you like being served by a grizzled waitress in a nurses top who has smoked a pack a day since she was do you enjoy old school diners and mediocre food at low prices if you answered yes to any of these questions ritters is the place for you the pic partner in cuisine and i have eaten there a few times but those times were really out of desperation because nothing else was open given all the food selections in the area i can safely say that ritters isnt the choice for most people but it fits the bill when you need something hot to eat im sure the pic and i will find ourselves back there before too long fantastic service incredibly inexpensive surprisingly tasty that pretty much sums it up as long as you come here knowing it is a cheap diner and not expecting something different you will enjoy your experience i had the spinach and feta omelet with tomato which came with a side of hashbrowns each of these was great our local diner for all the oakland students the breakfasts are large and tasty especially for the price but the food really isnt anything super special that said its a fantastic place to stop in on those late nights when youve been out having a few and are in the mood for something greasy service has always been friendly biggest downside is that they only take cash but you can use the atm they have on site if necessary iconic diner so ive been told and the proof for me today was the fact that the parking lot was packed and there were at least of us standing outside in line waiting in the rain for our turn at breakfast that says something either about the diner or about us nevermind the line went fast and we had friendly and efficient service from our server typical diner fare and what i expected it filled my stomach and i was happy i ordered french toast bacon and orange juice nothing fancy note that they do not take credit cards ritters will never be a fine dining establishment it will always be a diner it will always be a standby it will always be home cooked open and ready to accept you regardless of the time of day or the day of the week all that is truly required is that you find one item on the menu that you really enjoy for me that one item is the grilled chicken breast dinner i almost always get this item with the veggie of the day sliced tomatoes or sliced cucumbers it always tastes good and it never breaks the bank sometimes i might get breakfast but usually it is the grilled chicken breast everyone should try ritters at least once they only accept cash but they do have an atm present at the entry every now and then i do allow myself to order a slice of the freshly made banana cream pie wow it is tasty classic diner great cheap options definitely plan on going back the food at ritters tastes like i made it at home and this is not an endorsement i had the feta and tomato omelet and it tasted skunked like it had just been cooked in a dirty skillet its a dirty diner with meh food but it is open hours if youre drunk i bet the foood is great i have mixed feelings about ritters i love its location and of course the fact its open but you dont quite get what you pay for compared to other diners i do however love their pie i got the strawberry shortcake and it was very large and delicious definitely recommend im a huge fan of diners and all their fat filled breakfast food glory however ritters has left me doubting my borderline obsession i got the buckwheat pancakes apparently their specialty while they were fluffy and gargantuan the pancakes themselves were nothing to be desired this place is convenient cheap and open so if youre in an altered state of mind stumbling around oakland at in the morning ritters may be the place for you otherwise just go to bed but the service there was nice enough remember to tip well late nite meal gyro was a bit dry coleslaw and fries were great rice pudding was great they dont take credit cards cash only but damn do they have some good food the server we had was funny as hell its just a good old fashioned diner thats open and you can have whatevers on their menu lol early one recent morning still getting caught up on reviews i had their fried chicken and it was excellent moist and flaky i loved the strawberry shortcake too the portions are huge we didnt find the place to be dirty when we came they have their own free parking lot and have an atm inside if i had to give you just one reason to return to this establishment it would be that they have table jukeboxes filled with ridiculous music that of course you want to listen to fifty cents a play and it only takes quarters its easy to have your own little dance party in the booth as many have said before cash only so if you dont already have your cash or stopped at an atm no need to worry there is an atm right as you walk in not sure if its like this all the time but its a seat yourself type of establishment when we were there the place wasnt too busy and easy to run for the one server manning the floor i love the fact that the server wears scrubs being in close proximity to shadyside hospital of course dont expect surgery here the place is set up like a classic diner inside with the addition of some late model wood paneling its hideous and i love it from the booths to the counter seats where i assume you have to be a regular to sit there even the desert case at the register sadly only filled with minimal treats to take with you the bathrooms are typical and scary i walked into a swimming pool waiting to happen because someone forgot to turn off the water the food hmm the food what an interesting array of food to have for this place from grape leaves to meatloaf speaking of meatloaf thats what i had two decent size slices of meatloaf a scoop of diner mashed potatoes and the gravy on the side i also opted for the side salad which was simple with iceberg lettuce onion tomato and green pepper and the fresh is it really fresh bread that they give you is amazing if this place is this good at night i can only imagine what its like during the day this was some of the worst food ive ever had if this is someones idea of nostalgia nostalgia is a term id like to forget and the reality is more like nausea their greek soup tasted like campbells chicken noodle flavored with lemon and nasty lamb gyro douched with cucumber dressing will likely haunt me as long as i live for anyone looking for a good nostalgic diner experience i cant make a recommendation because ive yet to experience one but at least in this case leave the past where it belongs as many people have stated before me ritters diner does not accept credit cards i find it a bit shady undercover money laundering operation or something that such a well known restaurant doesnt accept plastic in there is an atm available for a fee they should really consider getting a credit card terminal i have opted out of ritters on several occasions simply because i didnt have any cash on me other than that the food is affordable and tasty to some of the people complaining about the food what did you expect this isnt fine dining this is a place you go get affordable basic food if you want fine dining go pay dollars a seat somewhere else good food good prices friendly service get a credit card machine please so after the encouragement of many of my friends i decided to gave this place another try we had the fried zucchini spanakopita and their fish sandwich i was prepared to be disappointed by the food again but i instead i had to kick myself on that last review it was still diner food but as far as diner food goes it was impressive i didnt even know diners served this vast variety of food i am a huge fan of breakfast food because besides it being the most important meal of the day i love the doughy goodness and comfort of pancakes and waffles this time i was dissuaded from ordering my usual and instead opted for some proper dinner food the spanakopita was a bit soggy but otherwise the meal was above satisfactory i had my first experience of fried zucchini and now i know what the fuss is all about theyre a delicious alternative to the classic potato fries and i delight to try them again while many people are unfavorably disposed to fish i love it i think its an acquired taste but their fish was perfectly crispy and the tartar sauce wasnt half bad either i would definitely go to this place again for a late night meal also their mini jukeboxes are incredibly cute so if youre feeling extremely nostalgic of the s then id go here the best diner in pittsburgh if you think its pamelas then you are very very wrong i wouldnt recommend getting anything other than breakfast or maybe a burger but those two things are more than enough for a star rating but maybe the best part about ritters is that the wait staff wears scrubs great food quick service nostalgia what more could you ask for my dad brought me to ritters many times when i was a kid before we moved out of the city now that im commuting to pitt im back before even talking about the food id like to say how nice the staff is theyre always in a good mood and they know their stuff in the three years that ive been going there i dont think that theyve ever let my coffee cup go empty breakfast is excellent no matter what time of day you have it i especially love their homefries which are nice and crispy but not overdone this may seem like a minor thing but youd be surprised how many restaurants can mess up a fried potato if youre coming in for lunch i would strongly suggest one of their salads the lettuce is fresh and crisp and so are the toppings if you get a steak salad the steak comes right off of the grill and onto your plate along with the fries the soups are also delicious although the greek lemon soup is a bit sweet i love their navy bean and beef barley soups cant get enough of them for lunch or dinner they have good comfort food meatloaf with mushroom gravy pork chops and kraut stuffed cabbage etc some days they make a homemade greek pastitsio did i spell that right which i think is even better than what is served at the greek food festival in oakland one last thing that id like to say is that they know how to make eggs over easy i like my fried eggs very runny or dippy or however you say it and ritters makes them just so a lot of breakfast places that ive been to tend to give you over medium when you ask for over easy just another indication that the cooks know their stuff your standard no frills diner open all day err day coming here is practically a requirement after a night on walnut street even during the daytime hours i prefer ritters to pamelas ritters is spacious no matter what time i show up ive never had to wait its not anything to marvel at but its diner food and youre getting exactly what you think their menu is typical diner food but more expansive than most i was a little surprised to see seafood options ultimately i always come back to the corned beef hash exactly like canned corned beef hash in every other diner but thats exactly what im looking for i also occasionally order the wings because ritters makes them the way i prefer freshly fried naked with your choice of dipping sauce on the side ive occasionally tried to branch out but find other dishes lacking the meatloaf was dry lacking in flavor but still a very heavy dish the burger was even dryer and was served deconstructed in a bad way however friends have had the differing variants of the pancakes and enjoyed them overall the cheap prices yet cash only hour convenience and rectifying my late night munchies get ritters a thumbs up in my book people call it critters for a reason the two times ive been there i was unhappy its cheap but the food is also gross and you dont get much of it thank goodness very small toast cold hard pancakes and adequate dippy eggs was what i received last time i went oh cash only too joyce was a great server she took great care of our party of and was very personable cheap average diner food you can have subpar breakfast lunch or dinner at any time of the day best consumed late night when nothing else is open i probably wouldnt go out of my way to go here besides a late night drunk snack traditional diner with red vinyl booths and diner coffee very homey and quaint and you cant beat the price i enjoyed the omelette with kale and black eyes peas and the home fries were perfectly crispy on top i will definitely be back for lunch or dinner there is plenty of parking on baum and the place was crawling with customers on sunday morning for breakfast the food was good slightly above average i ordered the steak and eggs and pancakes the pancakes were slightly below i hop quality i think they offer vegan and vegetarian food as well service was adequate but not over the top id go back if i was in the area ummm were pretty sure my boyfriend got food poisoning here that was the last thing we had eaten for hours and the next morning he definitely had eaten something bad after waking up yikes ritters is a pittsburgh treasure old school diner complete with at table mini jukeboxes that sometimes work great people watching here this is the place you come for late night munchies or possibly morning after recovery breakfast food is on point as is the greek fare cash only like most of the coolest spots in the burgh ummm so i will just be upfront and say that the few times i have been here i was at least a few drinks in but this is an excellent place for cheap diner food and is fortunately open late into the night im from the south so it is very reminescent of waffle house which is awesome the waitresses are nice and understanding of the state that some people come in at in the morning and it will always be a place i look to when i need greasy breakfast type food the hashbrowns are particularly amazing from what i remember it was cash only so if you go out make sure to have the moneys on you pretty standard greek diner omelets gyros pastas and burgers with a s look i cant say im a huge fan of the lunchdinner items maybe i just havent found the right items yet but the breakfast fare is great no exaggeration we probably come here once every other weekend the greek omelets are delicious dont let the idea of lettuce in an egg dish scare you off also it should be said the waitresses here deserve major praise they work very hard and almost always with a smile no matter how much theyre running around theyre fast pleasant and they are always busting their tails in this hectic place the food is really pretty inexpensive so for a table of two would usually only amount to about so my advice is tip the waitresses well they really deserve it now i know im about to come across sounding like some man from mars or a guy who eats nothing but cucumber sandwiches with the crusts cut off but what i mean to sound like is a guy who just got hit in the face with a wave of nostalgia and appreciation for a tragically dying thing the traditional diner conjure up in your mind the image of a perfect diner booth seating open late or better hours breakfast served all day an eclectic mix of patrons waitresses that call you darlin or sweetie bottomless coffee a certain fragrance mix of fry oil and cleaning product cheap prices and fast service and there you have ritters as i sat and enjoyed my eggs bacon toast and coffee i saw all of these elements uniting in near diner perfection add to all of that a stream of customers all of whom the staff seemed to know by name and greeted with smiles hugs and good natured ribbing the only thing missing that would make this place the pinnacle of diner ness the rotating pie case i cant speak to the dinner fare but come on if youre not ordering basic breakfast at a diner youre missing out on one of the great comfort food traditions in these here united states get a mess of eggs and breakfast meats some toast with too much butter and a coffee pay for it all pay up front no new fangled credit cards accepted wow and sit back and enjoy this wonderful slice of life pie optional dont get me wrong the foods great but when theres only a handful of booths full it shouldnt take an hour and a half to get breakfast if you get to the point that youd rather leave and go to mcdonalds just so you can eat something its too long of a wait how does this place even stay in business its disgusting the food is crap everything is filthy all the waitresses look like crackheads they screwed up a club sandwich fries how is that even possible it deserves negative stars for sucking so badly i have to show ritters some love ive been here more than times in the past few months and the service each time has been exceptional its old fashion but theres something comforting about it the coffee is very good freshly served and hot the food is served promptly fresh and hot ive ordered the fish sandwich twice along with fries and once with onion rings the fish is crisp and not too battered up the hoagie roll was soft and lightly toasted they also have the best cheesecake the portion are generous as well i always enjoy the food and visits here i love ritters the fried green tomatoes are my favorite and judging from the very long lines on the weekend i am not alone in my love of this place yes it is a million years old inside and out and so are the waitresses there are or waitresses and they share as many teeth but this place is old pittsburgh and you gotta love it the food is good not amazing unless youre drunk then it is f ing fantastic as per pittsburgh standards even bad food is pretty good if served in large quantities you wont leave ritters hungry you may leave with an infection or rash but you wont leave hungry just popped in to ritters for a late night dinner its definitely a step back in time shirley our waitress was really nice funny and helpful upon her recommendation we each had the hobo omelette which is filled with a gyros meat toppings and sauce it was excellent the side of home fries were crispy and delicious definitely give it a try on a postive note the honey dipped chicken dinner is tasty as well as breakfast however my meatloaf last night was anything but yummy there was no seasoning in it and i probably tasted one onion in the entire thick slices his greek lasagna was made out of easy mac noodles lasagna noodle on top it also had a teeny tiny bit of sauce im not sure what was greek about it the rolls were rock hard too ill come back when im drunk and hungry for a greasy am breakfast or a burger or appetizers since yelpers seemed to say good things about those also they changed their hours are are no longer always hours sunday monday tuesdays they close at ten one of the best breakfast places around i lovvvveeee this place they are open all night which is awesome the servers wear scrubs which is pretty cool and considering i am a server im jealous they get to wear some comfy attire at their job the food is incredible they have everything from home made roast beef dinners to fancy pancakes i came here last week with my boyfriends family and i ordered the bananas foster french toast with a side of ham the ham was incredibly juicy and just overall delicious the french toast was ridiculously good i felt like i gained ten pounds from my meal but it was incredible i love this place its always consistently good food is great however it is not open huge disappointment it was late at night went there thinking it is the only great restaurant that is open but found it closed why would you put a huge sign saying that the restaurant is open hours and on the other side it says it is only open hours in wednesday thursday and sunday but when i went there late at night in sunday it was closed how confusing it is not really that difficult to inform a customer of the opening hours anyhow i will probably still go there for breakfast we were skeptical to eat here based on the mixed reviews we can now say weve tried it and we probably wont go back we were greeted by a hostess who sounded and smelled like she just got done smoking instead of escorting us to a seat she told us which tables to pick and to seat ourselves i ordered the sirloin of beef with mashed potatoes and my fiance got the steak and eggs the food was just okay our server was friendly and attentive we were thankful we didnt have one of the other servers who was clearly dying of pneumonia or bronchitis or something she was coughing up a lung in front of everyone and sniffling every seconds she washed her hands a lot but the hostess did not wash her hands upon returning from smoking outside kind of gross if you ask me cheap price for good food ordered the fried chicken my mom got eggs and delicious pancake good and friendly service came on a empty monday night what you expect out of a hour diner food can be pretty good service can be pretty bad i remember my first experience at a diner art deco inspired architecture narrow and long floorplan jukeboxes neon signs quick service and extremely tasty pancakes with chocolate syrup granted i was only or years old then but i can recall everything how can i forget the taste of those pancakes since then ive been to quite a few diners including diner restaurants i e faux diners i would go particularly on the morning after a night of partying andor drinking when im feeling too lazy or hung over to cook something decent without burning myself and my kitchen on these mornings i would typically order pancakes or omelettes with a side usually hash browns and coffee honestly ive never eaten anything other than these breakfast staples at a diner my friends and i arranged to have a late brunch one day at ritters diner now i didnt have much to eat the night before so i couldnt wait until we met to have something to eat so i came to the diner having already eaten a light breakfast a quick observation of the diner made me realize that this isnt a traditional diner instead it seemed more like a diner restaurant oh well there was still the service and the food to worry about we sat down at a booth in the large room in the back of the restaurant the waitress greeted us and took our drink orders immediately two cups of coffee and two glasses of water several minutes later we got our coffee and water but werent ready to order just yet we spent several more minutes deciding and when we were ready we placed our menus in a neat stack in the center of the table to show that we were ready to order we waited and waited and waited some more minutes turned into half an hour and longer by that point my friends were getting quite hangry i was sitting there feeling sorry for them and very concerned with the poor service this whole time i was monitoring discreetly the other diners who had our waitress and arrived after we did a few of them actually have gotten their food have paid and have left after what seemed like an eternity our waitress suddenly materializes and takes our order we get our food chocolate chip pancakes club sandwich spinach omelette with cheese and buttered toast and something else sorry i mustve had too much coffee my omelette was decent i would have preferred if they hadnt used too much cheese especially what i think was american cheese it couldve been cheddar but the taste didnt seem right the toast was good but i was too full to keep eating i did try a bite of the chocolate chip pancakes and it was so rich and delicious my other two starving friends pretty much inhaled their food in minutes based on this one experience i would come only for the pancakes service was really bad even though the place was half empty i might experiment with this diner once or twice more to get a better feel for it so to summarize not a real diner service was bad food was decent and come for the pancakes it is definitely an experience located in not such a great part of town very old food is just ok grease upon grease everything came out from the kitchen hot but looked like it was all cooked in the same grease in the same pan waitresses do not make much of an effort she was more concerned with eating her meal cashier was a breath of fresh air she was chatty and nice awful experience we went on a sunday afternoon while waiting in the line an employee and the owner asked us in the rudest and most condescending manner possible to shut the front door because it was cold despite the fact that we were not the ones holding it open when our waitress took our order i asked her if the hot turkey sandwich or the turkey bacon and swiss sandwich was better she looked at me as if i had just asked her if they sold toilet brushes there before shrugging and telling me that they are both pretty popular we ordered wings and pierogies for appetizers for which we waited minutes when my boyfriend asked our waitress if the food would be coming soon she again acted extremely annoyed as if our presence was a nuisance she told us she did not know when the food would be up because sundays are really busy when the pierogies came we were disappointed to realize that only three came in an order the wings were dry i had decided on the hot turkey sandwich which was a little dry but tasted okay overall the bill was which seemed exorbitant especially in light of the horrible service and poor attitudes of every employee that we encountered i took my family of here on sunday we arrived at am and by we had not received our food this is after ordering over and hour ago we noticed the table around us received their food even though they had been seated after us the waitress was very nice and said she was sorry for the wait several times i finally asked to see the mgr who i assume is the owner he finally came to our table and after i explained the situation to him all he did was said that he really cares about his customers and if he made all his customers wait this way he wouldnt have any customers then he walked away he did nothing to compensate us for the long wait i go here because it is convenient for everyone the food is just so so well this will be my last visit i understand everyone can have a slip up but it is how they handle it to make the customer feel better ritters gets a failing grade in this category and an ok for the food best brunch ever you will have better luck getting seated quickly if you arrive by am they have the best potatoes in the burgh and its good food that will stick to your ribs the service is always quick and friendly ritters has two main perks breakfast and the jukeboxes the food is decent diner fare a co worker claimed he had the best steak of his life here and i can no longer trust anything he ever says ever again the food is fine but its certainly not gourmet nor will it top my grandmas homemade waffles but its cheap and you dont have to bake it yourself the service has been overall friendly and reasonably quick ive never been here when it was more than half full cash only breakfast breakfast breakfast ive been here many times over the years of which ive ordered breakfast diner breakfast easily excites me and this place hits the spot home fries over hash browns and if my bacon bends and not breaks then you can get from me i dont think ive ever had a bad experience here i love it here any time of day from early a m when the seniors are here to after hours when the drunks are here lol thanks for many delicious meals ritters and hopefully more to come this place is definitely a throwback whether you come in here at am in a drunken stupor or pm for a quick meal the food is fantastic the breakfast items are all pretty standard but i do enjoy getting it sometimes for dinner some of the other things you must try are the grilled chicken on a pita or the diner burger the menu is large and i constantly flip through it even though i know it like the back of my hand the service is usually very good and i love the quarter jukeboxes at the tables awesome place nice shapely ladies will be a patron of again just dont get anything with cheese it seems like faux cheese this place is one of only a couple open in the burgh hours thats an automatic star in this dead city they have plenty of food choices hence the other star but the food is actually pretty terrible the only items that are good there are the bacon and toast i really dont understand the appeal other than its open hours but then again so is eat n park which is actually a little better than ritters the food just isnt that great i actually make a better omelet at home and the other downside is that its cash only yes they have an atm on site but its not from any local bank so the fees are outrageous the only breakfast diner in pittsburgh that was truly spectacular was jojos in the strip which had been replaced by the equally unspectacular kelly os the food is fine and sometimes when the stars align can be considered good i usually get an omelet bacon and some potatoes it seems like most pittsburghers my age have went here since they were kids the food is a solid stars but the nostalgia bumps it up a bit ritters diner menu http imgur comaiscb they dont have a website or a menu online so i uploaded one on imgur i just went to ritters if for nothing else than to put a menu online for everyone to see yeah that place is that old and that outdated my order eggssausagepotatoestoast fried chicken and french fries and finally chili cheese fries the good they have parking though their lot is a bit odd no parking no visit from me the eggs were pretty good cant say anything bad about them and they were some of the better eggs i had the potatoeshome fries were also pretty good i really like the consistency of their french fries their fries are long and taste good the breakfast prices are reasonable they do have a wide variety of options on their menu they have seafood burgers hot dogs chicken steak breakfast food ice cream and other stuff the bad its and they have no website or menu think about that i have no idea how they could ever find customers not from the local area they could put up a website for free and a menu as well it would take less than day of their time theres restaurants from third world countries that have menus online they want for cheese on their eggs i can almost buy a full pack of cheese for that price the fried chicken is so so but they want ish for one chicken wing sized leg a mostly small breast and an even smaller leg not worth it at all since you can get a better deal at popeyes or kfc who i both find expensive their chicken is better too my friend got an omelet of some sort and seemed to really like it would i return there i could see myself returning for a quick breakfast once in a while but i dont see myself going there for dinner recommendation i cant say i recommend you going out of your way for this place theres really nothing special about it but they do have a wide variety of options on their menu parking and the breakfast prices are reasonable its no peppermilla chain of diner restaurants in the west that are fabulous though id like to preface this by saying i am not one to go out of my way to write a negative review and am really easy to please nevertheless a few of us went out after late night bowling to get some food we went to ritters because it was literally the only place open within a mile radius and we were starving anyways we made our way past the pack of chain smoking waitresses on the front steps and were seated every surface in this place is covered in a thin layer of oily grime its clear that cleanliness is not a priority here your hand will stick to the table if you touch it and the bathroom looks and smells like something out of the movie saw the waitstaff didnt even pretend to be friendly and honestly looked like they just rolled in from a halfway house also our frail elderly waitress was clearly extremely ill and really shouldnt have been handling food the food itself was pretty terrible but its a diner and the only option around after midnight so whatever we got the bill and proceeded to the counter to pay the little old white haired curmudgeon who i guess runs the place shuffles over to the counter rips the bill out of my hand and says give me i politely ask if we could pay separately there were four of us he grunts something inaudible with a sourpuss look on his face and i ask him to repeat himself he then raises his voice and rudely says give me i dont have time for this im very busy it was am there were maybe people in the entire place and all he was doing was sipping coffee at the counter he could have just said sorry we dont split checks and it would have been fine no need to be nasty hes like the soup nazi from seinfeld but not nearly as funny you shouldnt be mean and condescending to your customers if you want them to return i know that neither i nor my friends ever will old school diner experience alright food decent service super busy satsun am noon classic layout and atmosphere from the huge eat in bar area to the waitresses wearing nurses outfits sometimes this place is a hit or miss unless you get breakfast related items then youre good to go theyre desserts are delicious too ritters is where i go for diner food when i dont want to wait at pamelas or its an off hour time standard diner fare but with a greek twist i very much like the stuffed grape leaves and the spinach and feta omelette i havent sampled much else on the menu because im vegetarian and the dinner options are limited in that regard on a different note i find the diner atmosphere to be a little depressing the interior could use some cleaning and sprucing up additionally several times ive been there the table has smelled strongly of cleaning product which is not very appetizing i would really like to give it stars but thats not an option the fried green tomatoes are delicious just perfect overall such a fun charming and delicious diner with an extremely accommodating wait staff was here with my mom a while back and we fell in love the coconut pancakes were killer definitely will be back update i went back for dinner to give them a fair shake well my first clue was sticking to the table stains were present from other diners no biggie i will ask to have the table wiped down while i listened to the waitress arguing with another old timer over the price of a roll who manages this and lets this stuff go on i decided to check the silverware yep leftover food particles i have a healthy immune system i think well then my sprite came in a clear glass the white milk like stain on the inside of the drink was slowly flaking off into my ice last straw i told the waitress and walked out filthy mcnasty my morning review is below walked over from upmc to have breakfast typical diner look and menu i really dont get the hype as the food was average at best the server was nice and attentive thus the third star one thing that bothered me was one old man who just got up got behind the counter and helped himself to drinks clearly a customer and not an owner i may try something else but really underwhelming concerning the hype this was one of the less tasty places we went for food when i visited pittsburgh with my family my brother goes to pitt whatever was in my omelette tasted super weird the food was generally underwhelming and you dont go to a diner for service or atmosphere well i guess you do to an extent but you dont want your eggs tasting funny who knew it was possible to mess up eggs anywho our waitress was real nice and all but i wouldnt necessarily come back here i was visiting a church in the area and decided to try this diner it had mixed reviews so my curiosity got the best of me the menu is lengthy i am a huge breakfast food fan so i decided to order breakfast i usually go the eggs and bacon route but flipped the script when i saw the coco loco pancakes they are pancakes with chocolate chips and coconut i also ordered a side of bacon my son got bacon eggs that came with toast and home fries when my pancakes came they looked like your typical pancakes with a light sprinkling of coconut and chocolate chips there was also a drizzle of chocolate syrup i was a tad disappointed i ate the top pancake and it was incredibly delicious i thought its too bad this is not in each pancake still hungry i started eating the two remaining pancakes oh my word there wasnt any coconut in them but they were packed with chocolate chips im talking packed they were some of the best pancakes ive ever had the side of bacon was a little salty which was needed to break up all of the sweetness of the pancakes my son eats dippy eggs runny sunny side up im not a fan but he enjoyed them living in the burgh we are used to getting italian bread as toast but this was true blue white sandwich bread he cleaned his plate so that should tell you that he liked it a lot the diner is exactly that a true diner it has never been updated the menu has probably been the same for more than years but if your parking lots they have are filled that means you are doing something right the cars were everything from old beaters to porches that says a lot as well we will definitely be back to try other menu items i have only really been here late night so keep that in mind ritters is located within walking distance of the bars in shadyside and bloomfield and unfortunately its the only place open at am as such i have been here more times than i would ever want to if i were blackout drunk cooking on a george foreman grill i could make better food if you like your eggs served in a puddle of miscellaneous kitchen liquid or bite into a chicken parm sandwich and have the breading slip off of the entire piece of chicken this is your place though i could list the horror stories i have experienced i will concentrate on one that summarizes this diner friend orders a milkshake only gets the glass and not the residual leftover in the mixing metal cup he drinks it rather quickly and wonders if the leftover will ever come so he waits and waits keeps looking at the counter where the leftover bit is just sitting there minutes later waitress finally walks over to it drops a little bit of icecream in it mixes it puts it into a glass and serves it to someone else we called it the circle of milkshake life in that every milkshake is half old half new people keep coming back perhaps because they like the little nickel jukeboxes or because nothing else is open i have even heard it being called a pittsburgh culinary institution im sure the brothers primanti pamela and the delucas are rolling over in their graves if they are infact dead whats sad that though i am downright disgusted with this place at times i know that i will return one drunken night fml just writing this now because its funny but at the time it wasnt went to ritters many times because i am from bloomfield once years ago while at breakfast with my sister i went to put sugar in my coffee and out of the sugar shaker plopped a giant dried booger onto the spoon ha ewwwww i stopped into ritters for breakfast this past sat morning at am despite living two blocks away and having driven by many times id never dropped in until now given that i needed an inexpensive and convenient place to meet someone who also lives nearby i figured it was as good of an opportunity as any to try it out so i suggested it and we met for sat breakfast fortunately my friend arrived min before i did and was able to secure a table since ritters gets quite crowded on sat mornings also fortunately the interior is quite large which is necessary given its popularity at peak hours once i was seated our server promptly took our orders which was appreciated however it took almost half an hour for the kitchen to get them out which seemed long given the amount of time that my friend had already waited and that ive received prompter order fulfillment at other diners such as the dor stop once it finally emerged the food itself was pretty standard quality diner food nothing to write home about given that it was halloween morning i ordered the pumpkin pancake special with a side of bacon i could definitely detect pumpkin in the pancake batter which was nice but ive been spoiled by the dor stops pumpkin pancakes which are available year round btw and these didnt hold a candle to them the bacon was also disappointingly chewy to the point that i didnt even finish part of my last strip my friend ordered the chicken sandwich which seemed of similar mediocre quality though i didnt try it overall ritters met my standards for diner food but didnt exceed them and failed to meet them in some respects chewy bacon argh one thing ritters has going for it is that the prices are quite reasonable however come prepared as only cash is accepted i realize that a lot of their business comes from inebriated customers late at night so if that describes your situation it probably hits the spot if youre willing to travel and are looking for a good weekend morning breakfast though i recommend the dor stop in dormont or central diner and grill in robinson both of which illustrate that diner food can be better than mediocre in fact it can be great just had lunch i think everything is good there got a lamb gyro a good alternative to burgers great wait staff very friendly but not in your face friendly titters is the best diner in pittsburgh their home fries and basically of their late breakfast menu items are great because of this ive never tried any of the rest of the menu bring quarters if you feel like setting your iphone down for a minute to listen to an old school flip menu jukebox just dont play any survivor if there is a couple breaking up in the booth next to you its a diner its what you would expect from a diner decent food friendly service and reasonable prices they keep the coffee coming and your food is hot when you get it i mean really what more do you want zero service was terible i know food i love food but i have honestly had better food out highway restaurant bathroom than what was served to me today horrible excuse of a slop house dont eat here food recooked and disgusting there are many other choices on the pittsburgh area do not make the mistake and eat here great food great service only thing i dont like is that the majority of the jukeboxes dont work i love this place especially for a hearty breakfast i have several dietary restrictions and they are always very accommodating the food is delicious and the price is unbeatable above average food below average prices spacious and uncrowded free wifi cash only not bad steak eggs homefries real good rye toast water tastes like rust but had ojgrapefruit mix typical diner very good breakfasts at a reasonable price i visited my first time because its a pittsburgh landmark but i keep going back because of the great food the wait staff is always friendly and i rarely have to wait long for a table you wont find savory gourmet food here but you will experience an honestly good traditional diner experience at a good price i like that they have free parking available and generous hours always a reliably solid choice ritters is a typical old fashioned diner its cash only with an atm inside theres a parking lot which is convenient overall my experience eating here has been inconsistent sometimes the food is good sometimes i could barely eat it sometimes the servers are attentive and very friendly sometimes they have a terrible attitude ive had delicious meals such as the breakfast items sandwich melts and honey dipped fried chicken and while breakfast is usually solid lunch and dinner varies for example my most recent trip here a few days ago was dismal my friend ordered pierogis like he always does because they are usually very very good but this time we sent it back for some butter because it was bone dry when it was brought back there was a small hair in it i ordered a grilled chicken salad its hard to screw up a salad but ritters managed to do so yes the portion was huge but i found yet another hair in it and there was a pool of water at the bottom of the bowl my tip is to order breakfast foods because they dont mess that up and its good going in during the day seems to bring about better service and food even though eating here is a hit or miss i have a feeling ill be back to try my luck its one of the few places open late after the bars close so ritters is my favorite diner if i get time in the morning i love to stop for corn beef hash they also have a great gyro and sausage and cheese omelette lots of local gossip to be heard jukeboxes on the tables are nostalgic remind me of happy days open all hours leads to sightings of interesting characters mac machine inside is convenient and necessary as they dont take credit cards oh ritters i had heard of you for a long time but simply never made the trek out your way until yesterday i had a chance to dine here with a number of other yelpers and i think we all absolutely loved eating here firstly im in love with their menu a lengthy list of americas classics and favorites with a few extra non traditional additions just for good measure choosing what to eat at this diner was my biggest challenge of the past week i eventually settled on the greek hobo omelet which is a delicious mix of gyro ingredients that comes complete with a side of tzatziki sauce to go with the ensemble add in the amazingly fresh hash browns and heavily buttered toast and i was served up quite the feast and i devoured it like the happy glutton i was not only did the food leave me happy but keep in mind that my group was a group of over people all of our food was at our table within minutes of ordering and based on the comments of thats delicious that i heard all around that speed is all the more impressive due to the quality of the food that was produced i will definitely make the trek out to ritters again in the future especially now that i know that they have their own parking lot as parking is the biggest reason i dont venture to this part of town very frequently i need to try a few more things that caught my eye on their awesome menu but next time im definitely remembering cash as theyre cash only and i admittedly dont want to pay an atm fee to get cash in their main room every time i eat here updating this because its been a while since i visited guess what ritters is still just as good surprise surprise note the sarcasm our group of was seated right away on a cold saturday morning around am i ordered pancakes egg whites and bacon i was given a huge portion of three fluffy pancakes a large portion of eggs three pieces of bacon the bacon was actually a little disappointing it tasted as if they bought the cheapest kind or maybe it was just a bad batch everything else was delicious i saved one of the pancakes for breakfast the next day it was just as good the egg whites were perfect and were super filling my boyfriend loved his french toast home fries and sausage the home fries were delicious i love that you can listen to music on the jukeboxes while you enjoy a delicious breakfast this place is exactly what it should be good greasy spoon diner food bougie foodies with high expectations stay calm ive only had good food here and i always leave stuffed and satisfied the greek hobo omelette is my absolute favorite if you get coffee the only way to get the most bang for your two plus bucks is to get a few refills while youre there other than that its pretty much what youd expect from a diner ritters is an institution of a sort in the east end for me i like breakfast here but not much else i love greasy diner breakfasts like pamelas or for those of you who have experienced it the venus diner its out of this world ha ha i kill me i feel like ritters is one of those love it or hate it kind of places love it or not there are some things that make this place really unique the waitresses all wear scrubs like nursing scrubs which i find ironic because sometimes after clogging my arteries with my three meat omelet i feel like i need medical assistance the coffee i swear on my life its that chicory crap that southerners love it def has a distinct taste the atmosphere is decidedly grubby chic but in a good way they clearly have not put a dime into the place but it works somehow they like pamelas only take cash but there is a little atm in the foyer like i said the breakfast is greasy and delicious as it should be of all the other things ive had there the burgers are kinda icky like frozen semi meat rounds the specials ie stuffed cabbage tuna casserole meat loaf usually need salt or some other flavor factor you will notice a greek theme because the family is greek they have a few different greek foods like gyros and grape leaves and things ive had the gyro and its not bad but if you go and they have the lemon chicken soup on special get it i loved it never would have thought it but i did ive never had a problem with the staff some are more talkative than others but they are all pretty nice and accommodating oh and they are pretty good on pies too its ok at best food not so great french fries are bitter meaning the geese is old soup not hot waitress and cook fighting loudly it across from my hotel but wont be back i mean come on this is how its supposed to be done this diner is everything it should be and nothing it shouldnt is the food the best in the city no but its not trying to be its delicious though and done just the way you expect people know each others names the atmosphere is second to none its all family feels like home and ive only been to pittsburgh times in my life even though it is close to some hotels this establishment seems to cater mostly to the locals which usually means good value we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of food the cod was especially fresh friendly waiting staff love places like this its exactly what youd expect and you cant beat the greasy diner ambience solid breakfast not revolutionary but tasty and reasonably priced dont expect super peppy waitstaff or to be checked on every three seconds which works for me a little surliness just adds to the experience i love you ritters i hope to dine with you many many more times another pittsburgh institution definitely a go to place on the weekend wee hours of the morning after a night at the club when you need cheese fries pierogis or a giant omelette to get you to sleep its like taking a step back in time with the table side jukeboxes in every booth decor and staff attire i can only imagine what the staff have had to put up with over the years so many drunks so little time lol this greasy spoon diner is a classic again great for late night munchies with friends as well as meal time with family my girlfriend and i live within walking distance of ritters and seem to stop by every other weekend after my late nights of uber driving getting there around am the place is always bustling i like the energy and definitely need some good american diner food after driving around the same bar crowd thats now at ritters late nights on the weekend are typically louder because of the drunk crowd but ive seen a stern woman playing mom for these kids mandating that they cannot squeeze into a booth seat in my guess over half of the guests at the time had been drinking that night harmless college aged kids and young adults for the most part the staff are always great to us perhaps just relieved they dont have to deal with more frat bros and party girls my girlfriend and i are always treated very well one waitress even compd us an extra order of mozzarella sticks lol thank you as for the food it really is that classic warming diner food that makes you feel good before bed or nap time my girlfriend always gets the reuben and it is honestly fantastic i get the southwest burger and its just the best balance of bbq sauce onion rings and burger patty an iconic classic diner with genuine staff i really enjoy going to ritters time and time again do bring cash as this is a cash only diner stars ritters see you this weekend cash only is not an acceptable policy in this trend has to stop it is not ok i refuse to patronize any business that only accepts cash we ate our meal the food was good by the way and the service was nice only to be told at the end that they didnt accept cards had to then pay a dollar fee to get cash out of the atm in their lobby this is a scam and highly unacceptable if this ridiculous and offensive cash only policy is changed i would gladly change my review to stars if the card fees are a concern raise your prices by and no one will know the difference}

{62228, Buck & Badger, 115 State St Capitol Madison WI 53703, went for lunch today and thoroughly enjoyed the meal i ordered the wild boar burger whoa i ate wild boar and although the patty was quite small i was full at the end of the meal the flavor of the burgertoppings was really nice and the fries were great be warned though that burgers come with a small side of coleslaw but any other sides fries sweet potato fries etc cost extra the guy i went with had the bison burger and enjoyed it though he did not like his sweet potato fries they were soggy it is a little pricey for lunch approx if you get a burger with a side and drink but at least you get a free warm chocolate chip cookie at the end of your meal also i love that the place is so new that it still smells like fresh cut wood yum came here for lunch on a thursday with some co workers we left with mixed feelings most of us disappointed and wont be back this place is pretty new it opened in the space that ians pizza moved out of they spent quite a bit of work to completely redo the interior they attempted to capture the up north feel with lots of cedar wood and country decor there was a gas fireplace in the middle of the dining room which i really liked i got the whitefish hoagie the menu said that all sandwiches were served with a side of sweet mustard cole slaw hmm i dont remember tasting any mustard or any sweetness or anything all it was weak mostly watery cabbage with a touch of cream my sandwich was okay the red pepper aioli didnt stand out i actually thought it was melted cheese until i reviewed the menu just now there wasnt any tartar sauce served the sides are kind of a rip especially the traditional fries theyre a add on and they couldve easily been from the frozen section at woodmans foods one of my co workers got the wild boar burger fries and a can of beer his bill was before tip seemed pretty steep for a lunch itd be different if any of the items were standout but they were lacking one co worker had the grilled cheese sandwich with fig jam sliced apples he was really happy with it out of our group of hes the only one that said hed come back we went to buck badger last night with friends for dinner pm on a saturday night when we arrived there is a hostess stand right inside the front door with the usual please wait to be seated sign so we waited and waited and waited no hostess appeared two groups of people came in behind us and joined the wait for the elusive hostess the bar area was crowded and the bartenders definitely noticed the large crowd waiting to be seated but made no move to summon a hostess finally our friends texted us to let us know they were already at a table they had asked the hostess to let us know but since she had disappeared we didnt get the message so we went to sit down i never saw the groups behind us come into the dining room so i am guessing they got fed up waiting and left our waitress was very pleasant and friendly and brought us our drinks right away as a previous poster mentioned the beer came in cans even though there is a full bar with plenty of beer on tap two of us ordered the bison burger which was just ok it was pretty small the waitress said it was lb but it seemed smaller and definitely not worth the price especially considering that sides are not included and cost extra the regular french fries were pretty lackluster maybe a step up from mcdonalds fries and the sweet potato fries were soggy my fiance said the whitefish hoagie was nothing special and our friend who had the french fried cheese said it was not very good there were some decent parts of the meal our friends noted that the twice baked potato and french onion soup were delicious at the end of the meal we were given a plate of chocolate chip cookies which were ok but they were basically just mass produced cookies that had been warmed in the microwave to make them seem fresh baked i would much rather they forget the cookies and just focus on serving better food overall we felt like the food was bland and very overpriced and while our waitress was ok the service in general was pretty poor we will not be going back i went to the buck and badger over the weekend background info i was there at ten on saturday night so it was a little busy but not crowded by any means i was at a table of ten where each person was ordering a single item i e beer water or soda not too difficult well the waitress was rude slow and inaccurate i know ten is quite a bit but you are writing it down she was not prompt in checking in on us nor was she accurate i asked for my check and she said i owed for way more drinks i was the first one to pay so she could have figured it out it took her ten minutes to come back to figure out she added too many items after i told her exactly what was on my bill i paid my bill then i found out i was still overcharged for one of my drinks i did not have the menu when i ordered but my friend caught an overcharge she and i had the same items overall very disappointed in the service it is saturday night get someone who can handle the pressure i would go there again but i would hope for another server otherwise the beer selection wine selection and fun items shot skis and paddles were impressive i always get wary when a restaurant tries to hard to push a theme in this case buck and badger is supposed to resemble an up north restaurant with a stuffed moosehead fake me thinks and a log cabin motif nevertheless i thought to give it a whirl as we biked down state street on one of the first nice days of spring the menu is typical american fare wings some salads hamburgers made from the various animals cow boar lamb bison and entrees i opted for the duck salad no tomatoes while my year old daughter went with the childrens mac and cheese the meal took a tad bit long to come out with our waiter coming out to inform us they made the salad with the tomatoes and were making me a new one i was happy to hear that until the second attempt at the salad came out evidently when i requested no tomatoes the cook also thought iheshe should include any other vegetable it was missing the red peppers onions and celery that the menu described while the duck was well prepared and the apple cider vinaigrette adding a nice acid to cut through the richness of the duck the salad lacked anything crunchy and therefore was forgettable my daughters mac and cheese was generous in size and i appreciated the fact that the sauce was homemade and well balanced good but nothing to come back for buck and badger would do better if it lessened the schtick around the northwoods really the kids menu item comes with an antler crown which basically guarantees a therapy visit or two when they get older from the humiliation reduced the size of their menu and focused on delivering well executed meals while i would say that the restaurant wont be around long due to the amount of nearby competition the fountain coopers etc they probably will as the owner also owns the capitol tap haus yawn and the ivory room license to print money i feel pretty let down by my two experiences at buck badger ive been for lunch and dinner both times service was pretty slow despite there not being many customers i had the chicken pot pie which was served in a sort of upside down pyramid of a bowl it looked large when it first came but soon revealed itself to be shallow and a pretty sad portion for the price it wasn particularly flavorful either my date had a burger which he said was just ok went back a different day and had the grilled cheese with apples and fig spread the apples turned out to be more like apple pie filling way too sweet also for a grilled cheese is quite steep especially since you also have to pay extra to get a side of fries i would love to love buck badger since i work a block away and they have a lovely fireplace i can imagine having lunch there while reading a book by the fire but i guess what it comes down to is there are much higher quality and less expensive places to go in the area i wasnt blown away by this place the food was decent but the restaurant setting was good leaning toward great it has a great feel to it and definitely is trying to bring a northwoods feel to madison this was a spur of the moment stop for dinner this is a place i could see myself stopping in more for the bar than to sit down for dinner our waitress was great and it does have outside seating however i did not sit outside for those who are looking for a good root beer on tap this place does have sprechers overall it was a good experience ok well lets get a few things out of the way first this place isnt very big so theres not much space to do anything its also kind of expensive when it comes to drinks around madison so why am i giving it four stars well a drink purchase here can be used as the cover to get into the ivory room and the second and much more important reason is that they have shot skis shoooooooot skiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis food is great flank steak meatloaf is amazing duck breast is fabulous unfortunately service is not two of us ordered soup this evening one came out with a the main course couldnt even fit it all on the table my meal on the other hand never made it out she totally didnt even bring it this is rd time at his restaurant and service has been less than adequate probably will not be back too many choices of great restaurants on state street although buck and badger has a whole section on their menu devoted to delicious looking meat burgers i went against conventional wisdom and ordered their veggie burger what the what i promise you its good the grilled portabella topped with grilled peppers and provolone cheese tastes almost like meat if not better buck and badger also has some really great cocktails the one that got away which is jack daniels tennessee honey with root beer is tasty as well as a large selection of beer they also host geeks who drink trivia on tuesdays great overall experience the atmosphere and presentation were different but really cool food was a bit pricy but satisfying a friend recommended this place so the other night while i was downtown i decided to check it out with a friend we were there about pm and were seated immediately we chose to have a seat inside my friend ordered the steak sandwich and fries he thought the sandwich was fine i ordered the shoestring fries which were just regular fries and were virtually tasteless i didnt think they were good at all i also ordered the french fried cheese which were like mozzarella sticks but with wisconsin cheddar they were warm ish and the cheese wasnt melty at all overall i wasnt impressed and i dont plan to return the food is good and a great selection of beer friendly staff the inside atmosphere is like a lodge if your idea of comfort food is overpriced gummy tasteless and fried carbs smothered in cheese andor bacon then by all means help yourself to some diabetes in a bread bowl i scoured the menu and couldnt find a damn thing that wasnt carb based or slathered in meat or dairy im not even vegan or vegetarian i just dont like my food to sit like a rock at the bottom of my stomach for hours after i eat it ive never wanted to stick my finger down my throat so long after eating half an entree so thanks for getting me to try new things buck badger my boyfriends family and i were looking forward to trying this north woods themed restaurant and bar as we are lovers of being up north and miss that feeling down here in madison i will say that this restaurant provided this ambiance and did it very tastefully however the food was severely lacking we all ordered burgers and were surprised to see that the burgers didnt come with french fries instead they came with coleslaw this would have been acceptable if the coleslaw was any good but it had zero flavor and was a huge disappointment also my boyfriends mother ordered french fries and they came out stone cold and soggy pretty gross actually she told the waiter and he brought out a fresh hot order of fries but they were still soggy our burgers were cooked perfectly and very delicious however service was decent but nothing to write home about i only came here for drinks their specials are inexpensive and pretty good save your receipt and you can use it instead of paying cover charge to enter ivory horrible it took an hour for us to get our food no apology for the server we will never go back i really wanted to like this place love the fireplace inside and kinda enjoy the decor but the service isnt very good went before a concert with some friends and every aspect of the meal took a overly long time it took at least minutes for our server to great us another to get our drinks and minutes to get our food it was very frustrating not to mention the food was bland and had zero presentation great food outdoor seating right on state street adorable wait staff have the cheese curd fritters rockin three friends and i were looking for a restaurant on state street for dinner before a show at the overture center one friend said he was really craving a burger so when we came upon the buck badger we decided to give it a try we figured if they were able to afford to be so close to the capitol they had to be pretty decent unfortunately this was not the case we were seated right away and were served drinks pretty quickly which seemed promising although the specialty jack daniels cocktails two of us ordered came in disappointingly small glasses but then after we ordered our food we waited and waited and waited it was at least a half an hour before our food arrived so even though we had initially given ourselves well over an hour to eat before our show started we felt rushed once we finally got our food the food itself was okay but nothing that wowed us i chose not to spend the extra for a side because i thought the coleslaw that came with my sandwich would be good enough who seriously wants to spend for a side order of fries but the coleslaw was absolutely tasteless the menu describes it as sweet mustard cole slaw but it was basically wet cabbage my chicken sandwich while nice and hot was also pretty bland the sweet potato chip breading didnt have as much flavor as id anticipated and they really skimped on the chipotle mayo my friends enjoyed their burgers but didnt seem overly impressed and the long wait certainly didnt help if id had a chance to read reviews before we went there i dont think we would have gone in the first place knowing that we had a show to get to and others have experienced the same very long wait we did also other reviewers mentioned that they received complimentary chocolate chip cookies we didnt get any so either they no longer do this or they were forgotten since we had to flag down our waitress just to pay the bill so we could get to our show on time either way this was a disappointing dining experience and with so many other restaurants on state street i wouldnt bother with a second visit to the buck badger trivia tuesday what a fun time testing our trivia skills enjoy a couple of appetizers and beer they have a good selection of beer on draft abd i believe have bottle beer too definitely support local wisconsin beer our bartender was super friendly he even bring us cookies during trivia the only thing special about this place is the outrageously expensive prices and uncomfortable chairs never going back again move along folks theres nothing to see here we went here for takeout during a jazz at concert the burger was huge and undercooked it had a burger king like charcoal taste without the beef flavor i ordered cheddar and they apologized for only having white cheddar ah this is wisconsin the whitefish sandwich we ordered was good the french fries here were unexplainably greasy and limp the cole slaw was very vinegar tainted overall an unimaginative kitchen in a neighborhood brimming with great alternative choices fairly new establishment that took over for the pizza place ians that moved to across the street feels like a huge sauna in here they definitely put some money into the place i did not eat here so this review is really just to remind me to return next time for some grub i like the food here i like sitting outside when its nice out and sitting inside for the cozy cabin interior during winter i like coming here at night and grabbing a drink to waive my cover for the piano bar i like the convenience of this place sure the food isnt the best or most unique in madison but its bar food i think buck badger is at least stars and will give the benefit of the doubt since we cant do half stars on yelp great service food was tasty but you get charged cents for a side of ranch coleslaw that comes with sandwiches standard is tasty we also had sides of sweet potato fries and french fries husbands burger was average sandwiches a bit on messy side due to dressings great decor northwoods theme good beer selection tasty bloody mary with garnishes ive been here twice both times on trivia night on thursday geeks who drink is a very fun group i always have a blast my choice of beer moose drool yum and only on thursday im a little biased because i love stout and dark ales so drink with discretion service is amazing so on top of their game and constantly replenished us with beer when i asked theyre also pretty nice which is always a plus the space is too small for the events they advertise definitely not enough space to hold many groups of people who arent willing to share chairs on any other night if youre coming in and out the place is more than accommodating but on a busy night when people are trying to sit eat and socialize no overall very willing to come back to be impressed the fries didnt impress me so im hoping to come back for a meal i came here with a group of friends the menu is small i ordered a cheeseburger with fries the burger was a bit small too much bun and was rather pink although i had ordered it medium well the menu also stated that the sandwiches came with a side and a pickle but the pickle turned out to be two small pickle slices the fries were good nothing special my friends ordered the mac n cheese bake which they seemed to enjoy and a blt which seemed to be just ok the service wasnt great the waitress brought the wrong meal to one of us i have a feeling she was new though as she was flustered by some of our questions about menupayment so perhaps it isnt totally fair i have heard this place is fun for trivia but i probably wouldnt return for anything but to check that event out i love coming here when its warm and drinking a bloody mary or and people watching its within eyeshot of capital square and when the farmers market is going on you have a great view of everything and everyone service is good apps are good and the bloodies come with the most charming little beer chasers come on a saturday in the spring sit outside get day drunk and watch the madisonians do their thang i read in the madison magazine that this place has lamb boar and bison burgers so i wanted to try it out i sat at the bar and ordered the moose beer on special i was disappointed when i received a small menu and only saw beef burgers so i decided to try the regular burger with goat cheese added the burger came out a nice size and the goat cheese on it was about an inch thick and covered the whole burger i bit into it and was quite impressed nice and juicy just the right amount of pink in it and nice soft melty cheese it went perfect with the beer definitely recommend but would be better if they had what i initially came in for visiting madison for the first time and my husband and i were looking for a quick bite near our hotel when we got in stopped by this place since we heard they have trivia on thursday nights and had a great time it was a little loud since the game was on and the badgers won go badgers so i doubt its that loud on a regular basis the food was delicious environment was fun and relaxed and their beer selection was excellent especially for people looking to try wisconsin beer i mean how can you go wrong with spotted cow trivia was great as well our server was a little slow but again with the game on so i dont blame him had a great time our first night in town i stopped by the buck and badger after work for a quick beer and an appetizer while waiting for friends their beer selection was pretty good they had the beer that i prefer so that was good but the reason for my review is the bartender was a bit of a dick he was wearing a cap bro style on backwards and had this phony superior air about him it was off putting some people sat next to me and their first three beer requests the b b did not have the bartender gave them some pretty strong tude and said you guys have to broaden your horizons they handled it well but seemed slightly put off by it the menu options were limited and the prices pretty high they wanted for their fish fry special in madison a good fish fry is usually overall not impressed good food but not a great value a little pricey i liked the bison burger and the sweet potato fries but there are better options food wise on state ive been to buck badger a couple of times first a year or two ago for trivia and dinner and then most recently as part of a big buck safari bar crawl both times were quite enjoyable on my most recent visit the bar started out pretty empty holiday weekend madison marathon weird night downtown but that worked to our advantage as we had free reign over the game and plenty of room to spread out while waiting for our individual turns for the big buck nerds out there the screen has a good response just make sure to choose the controller on the left for the rest of you normal folks who probably go to bars for things like the drinks and ambience get ready to revel in a glossy magazine version of northwoods glory the interior is made to look like a log cabin with a great choice of blonde wood to keep it bright and clean looking there are plenty of taxidermied animals my favorite probably being the bear head to the right of the entryway bar that wears an antlered hat service is fairly quick and the bar offers everything from cheap cans to shot paddles to a tap line of the bars very own mobcraft brew everything is far too pretty and nice to actually remind you of being up north but its still a nice little spot in the heart of madison i went to geeks who drink pub trivia here with my wife and a friend on a tuesday night the pub trivia was a lot of fun and it will be the main reason that i am returning overall buck badger is an average bar the food is underwhelming but they have a good beer and cocktail selection the bar has rotating taps so if you enjoy a good brew you cant really go wrong the selection was diverse too for those with particular taste in beer i was disappointed by the selection of appetizers considering we arrived around pm just for drinks a snack and trivia for a pub that hosts trivia two nights a week the appetizersnack selection was lacking we ordered both the cheese curds and bacon cheddar fries the cheese curds were actually cheese fritters and there were only on the plate i was disappointed by the number served in the order and the sauce tasted like a simple dressing out of a bottle the bacon cheddar fries had a little too much salt on them between all of the ingredients and seasoning on top of it they definitely could have used more acid to balance the flavor out the service was acceptable for most of the night the server did a good job keeping us topped off on drinks and water but she failed to bring ketchup for the fries when asked the service wasnt horrible by any means but it could have been better overall im not terribly disappointed by buck badger but it just felt like a very average pub if you want good food and drink there are definitely better places you can go in madison the main draw of this bar is the trivia i hope future visits for trivia will change my mind and i can edit this review because i really do want to love this bar buck and badger i dont think ive ever wanted to like a barrestaurant as much as you ive given you multiple chances now and you have only gotten worse youre like perfect match on tinder you sound incredible look incredible but when we meet i find out youre unemployed and living with mom my friends and i have been frequenting buck badger for geeks who drink trivia honestly if they didnt host pub trivia i would never go here decent beer and cocktail selection has trivia poor wine selection food is underwhelming and overpriced poor snack food selection for a bar that hosts trivia service is slow unreliable and rude the bar has rotating taps so if you enjoy a good brew you cant really go wrong the selection was diverse too for those with particular taste in beer on thursdays you can nab a moose drool for not a bad deal good luck getting more than one due to service issues i was disappointed by the selection of appetizers considering we arrived around pm just for drinks a snack and trivia for a pub that hosts trivia two nights a week the appetizersnack selection was lacking we ordered both the cheese curds and bacon cheddar fries the cheese curds were actually cheese fritters and there were only on the plate i was disappointed by the number served in the order and the sauce tasted like a simple dressing out of a bottle the bacon cheddar fries not pictured had a little too much salt on them between all of the ingredients and seasoning on top of it they definitely could have used more acid to balance the flavor out the cheese was shredded and melted on top by the time it had reached the table the cheese was cool and crusty its also worth noting that the bacon cheddar fries are not on the menu we put in a special request for them the normal fries are and we were charged for this special request i dont think we ate worth of bacon and cheese so far my run in with the service at buck badger has been outrageous and beyond acceptable on our first visit the server decided start an argument with us when over hearing our conversation about spotted cow and claimed it was a hefeweizen i dont care that the server believes the beer is something that it isnt but she got very snippy when i was discussing it with the table and called it a cream ale that same night we specifically asked for ketchup twice and it never showed up over a hour period on a subsequent visit everyone placed their first drink order and a water pitcher with cups was left at the table the server never came back to ask how things were or to ask about a second round we were there for trivia that means at least hours sitting i had to flag her down to get a nd moose drool eventually the server showed up when full rounds of trivia remain and tries to talk to us while trivia questions are actively being asked i ask her to come back and she comes back in minutes with the checks for some reason one person at the table asked for another drink and she leaves half the checks on the table the drink never showed up and about minutes later a different server comes by with the rest of the checks and a small plate of burnt cookies i dont even know what to say i want to love this bar in no way were we rude to the servers but the service was just abysmal other reviewers seem to have had similar experiences too sorry buck badger we could have had something really special together you have broken my heart atmosphere i love the theme of this place cozy northwoods lodge lots of pine huge fireplaces camo t shirts for the wait staff feels cozy and comforting drinks pretty good specials any day of the week wednesday is moscow mules beer specials every day what sounds like a good happy hour price food not terrible pricing is pretty okay for what you get im a fan of the cheese fritters the grilled cheese fondue and the fish sandwich all of those dishes are or less and its good portions for that price however you are a wisconsin restaurant i shouldnt have to ask for tartar with my fish and i really dont think that should be an up charge but the fish was really tasty with the red pepper aioli and tartar together not a fan of the potato salad it was a literal formed scoop of it on my plate didnt look appetizing didnt taste appetizing fries are good but im not happy that they are a up charge to get with a sandwich or burger should just come with they arent extra good the donuts are good but didnt seem to be quite cooked all the way through cheese fritters are huge and always worth it service ive only ever gone during trivia nights so i dont know if that has something to do with it but i think ive only been there once where the service has been good most of the time were waiting for long periods for either our drinks our bill or for the waitress to check on us overall i want to like this place northwoods lodge twist on comfort food but i think youre trying to be just a little too classy for what you are something just feels off and if it wasnt for trivia nights i probably would have never eaten here ordered the black bean burger and the patty was only warm the potato salad side is already bad but it was cold so couldn t taste it on the spot but got diarrhea called and complained but received no call backs popped in here on a thursday night to take advantage of some trivia they also offer it on tuesdays the leader is really great and makes it a lot of fun the bar itself is really well decorated maintaining the theme of a lodge without being too kitschy there isnt a lot of seating in the bar so if you want to have a seat and a table for your game make sure you arrive early its literally a packed house but given that the bartender does an excellent job of managing the crowd and getting beers to guests in rapid time the beer selection is good with a ton of local beers on tap that rotate regularly we didnt eat so i cant comment on the food but if nothing else stop in to take advantage of trivia and maybe win yourself some free beer took minutes for our order for a burger salad salad was a bowl of spinach and endive with a couple diced tomatoes can you skimp any more oh wait yes you can you have to buy the salad dressing separate tack on cookies were a nice touch but rather insulting when theyre just shy of burned could have used them for hockey pucks speakers were so loud my seat vibrated dont even think about having a conversation all in all not a good experience wont be back and i dont recommend it for you plenty of other great restaurants in the area ill be sticking with the old fashioned from now on get your act together bucks we went for dinner with a group of friends on a thursday night first mistake thursday is trivia night and they actually ask you to keep the table talk down so people can hear the trivia questions i ordered pumpkin bisque and it was so thick it was like mashed potatoes it was so over spiced with alspice or clove that it was inedible my husband ordered the chicken pot pie and got a chicken sandwich the waitress took it back and said it would be a few minutes and we gave up after a half an hour and still no pot pie so we left the only reason it is getting one star is that i cant give it none our friends werent really happy either walking by on a foggy and drizzly monday night and the beautiful roaring fire caught our eyes my beautiful date and i went in and were seated pretty quickly bill took care of us and was super friendly turns out he was manager that evening he gave us options for specials and we got a couple glasses of really tasty wine i got a pinot and she got a riesling they had run out of the sweet potato au gratin side dish her and i both wanted and although they clearly made a good effort to find substitutions we gladly chose to get side salads instead the dressing for those had this smokey bacon vinaigrette dressing that was perhaps the best dressing ive ever had no joke main dish was the roasted chicken and carrots that really tasted perfect my date and i continued great conversation after our food was done and bill surprised us by bringing complimentary hot toddys which were also amazing we continued to talk sitting by that fireplace sipping our drinks but what we didnt realize until later was that nobody else was there but us and they were technically closed he never asked us to leave or anything but instead brought us drinks for free a star for ok drink deals got a pitcher for less than of good beer food is not so good the french fries tasted like they were from a big old bag of frozen fries worst of all this place seems like a cheap attempt to pander to wiscsonsin and madison the wisconsin and up north feel comes off as cheap and half aed chicken pot pie consists of a fairly small bowl of thick chicken soup with a pastry roll tossed on top of it before serving will not be back for that again food here is always excellent place is very up northy the boar burger is definitely one of the best out there and the apple cider glazed carrots are delicious if youre up for something a bit different definitely try this place ive given this place three chances in the past two years and every time was a complete disappointment the first visit was with my wife and a friend and probably the best experience of the three several beers listed were out of rotation and still being listed on the specials board outside the service was overall slow and inattentive i ordered the brat instead i was given a french dip i figured i wouldnt be back anyways so i left a decent tip and went on my way second visit is similar with the service being even slower we were at the restaurant for around two and a half hours our tables drinks were brought out when we were just about done with the appetizer the fries that came with my meal seemed as though they had been sitting in a fridge for several days at the end there was no acknowledgement of error so i left a lesser tip our third and final time was a spectacle of failure it took minutes for a server to recognize our presence another minutes pass and my wifes drink arrives but my drink is not on tap anymore my next drink choice does not arrive till after the appetizer again upon receiving our food burgers both ordered medium mine is served well done and my wifes is mostly medium rare with a small section appearing like it hadnt touched the grill shortly after our food came we find that the table behind us who had been there since we sat down still had not received their orders after three experiences like mine i will never recommend this place to anyone quite frankly its impressive that theyre still drawing a crowd of any sort food took a very long time to come out friend and i ordered burgers orders were mixed up and the fries were cold the burgers themselves were dry not much flavor with soggy piece of lettuce order a burger at five guys thats way better and cheaper told us they normally serve cookies but the chef burnt them all service was okay will not be coming back hoped this place would have been better but alas it was a pretty big let down service was on the awful side i got my beer but the wife didnt get her drink until we asked twice they said they would comp it but then they didnt ordered a small onion ring but charged us for a large the onion rings were brought out minutes before our sandwiches arrived it just went on and on and the food was just meh nothing to write home about this place is just not good they recently updated their menu which i think means they just cut it in half the food here is not very good the selection is tiny and in my experience weve had to send back food about of the time wrong orders cold wings undercooked burgers this place gets one star for serving alcohol and one star for having a fireplace and thats about it im more confused than anything i used to walk by this place all the time and see people eating these huge plates of what looked like pretty heavy foods big platters heaped with sides i also see reviews that mentioning things that at least sound interesting boar burgers whitefish hoagies etc when i went today i was kind of surprised to see an incredibly limited and boring menu some burgers chicken sandwiches fried apps and food that was served in red plastic baskets with no sides or garnishes or the pickle listed on the menu the food was ok we ordered burgers and chicken sandwiches none were very large or particularly tasty sauteed mushrooms were burnt and the large side of fries was ludicrously undersized and overpriced what we ate would be decent in a dive bar but seemed underwhelming in a place where they clearly spent so much money and effort on decor service was friendly but extremely slow despite the overpriced fries the total damage for four was pretty low i cant imagine going back though nor can i understand the appeal of this place star actually equals zero stars by far the worst service kitchen staff i have ever witnessed minutes later our burgers arrived ordered burgers not one burger was correct three separate trips back to the kitchen to fix the burgers and guess what still wrong on everyone one paid for the drinks we had and walked out im sorry but how hard is it to dress a burger reading off of a order slip ou and by the way there were still empty tables so no excuse for being busy will not ever ever go back dropped by and really enjoyed the atmosphere the food was decent will be back to try a beer disappointing summarizes our visit to bb this evening the food was mediocre at best my brother in law ordered the treetop steak and received literally just a burger patty it was hilarious and sad the only saving grace was leslie our excellent server shes the only reason im giving this place stars what happened guys you used to be good the menu is half the size it used to be and nothing was good im sad went to buck and badger for dinner last night before a comedy club show we got there an hour before the show the comedy club is a minute walk from buck and badger we were seated pretty quickly the server was very friendly and took our order quickly heres where it gets bad two of us ordered pasta dishes the server comes back to inform us that they are out of pasta we are pretty laid back and understand it was probably a busy for day for them so we order something else we waited over minutes for our food to arrive and they only had of our orders correct we were already running low on time and now we had to wait for the correct food they came back and had one of the orders wrong again since we didnt have enough time we decided not to say anything here comes the worst part one of my friends ordered a steak we are both sure that what she received was hamburger shaped like a steak it was not fleshy but rather had the texture of ground beef this was by far the worst experience ive ever had at a restaurant and we wont be going back ordered two philly cheese steak sandwiches with fries the waitress brought one sandwich with sweet potato fries extra according to the menu and one fish fry we sent the latter back and split the sandwich while we waited for the other one have you ever heard a cheese steak sandwich loaded with jalapenos my companion cannot tolerate hot food but jalapenos just dont belong on a cheese steak sandwich clearly the kitchen screwed up so that sandwich was a disaster finally the second sandwich came sans jalapenos it was average then the waitress tried to charge us the extra for the sweet potato fries we didnt order she took that off the bill along with one of the sandwiches fair enough but this place is lame never again we tried buck and badger before a show next door at the overture center theres a bar room and a dining room the ambiance is north woods cabin with lots of light wood the restrooms are shared with the ivory room in back the bartender greeted us immediately when we walked in and then a waitress quickly escorted us to a table she handed us the menus which i got a kick out of the cover is a heavy wood panel which makes the menu seem like it will be large but really its a small assortment of appetizers sandwiches and entrees for the most part the prices seemed quite reasonable there is a fairly extensive drink menu our server was friendly though not always prompt we werent that hungry so we decided to just go for appetizers and had the cheese curds and boneless chicken wings the cheese curds were excellent a decent portion light breading gooey insides we opted for blue cheese dipping sauce rather than ranch and they were quite tasty the boneless chicken seemed a little pricey for what you got we ordered the smokey bbq and a side of blue cheese the bbq actually came on the side rather than being on the wings itself which i was fine with my partner felt the chicken tasted like processed nuggets but i felt it was ok the menu said it came with carrots and celery which we had to ask for i was not wowed by any of the food but i did appreciate the ambiance the friendliness and for the most part the reasonable prices on the menu we went here for trivia and while its a nice space with a good tap list oh my god the food how do you screw up frying ive had better fast food cheese curds and better store brand ranch dressing than whatever they gave us service was friendly but a bit scattered it wouldnt be a dealbreaker but jesus that food was awful we walked out glad we hadnt placed well in trivia because the prizes were gift cards and that would mean wed have to come back maybe we still will because trivia was fun but im not touching their food good location place is clean food was edible but unimaginative bar fare executed in a below average way realize that service is in the eye of the beholder but it took ish minutes to get food at lunch when the place was dead given the numerous places to grab pub grub in the area i would probably pass on this place for food an acceptable place to grab a drink tried this place when it first opened and thought it was nothing spectacular food was dry plain bland etc portions were small considering the price service was alright again nothing spectacular my initial thought was theyre new theyre working out the kinks or something along those lines i also figured since it was on state they would bring a good product to the table being such a prime location so i for some reason elected to give it two more tries the second and third times mimicked the first time i wont be back buck and badger is my go to place for trivia which they host with geeks who drink on tuesdays and thursdays they tend to have some specials for beer which is great on tuesdays a tallboy of pbr is and they typically have one draft on special for the food menu is fairly short and seems to change somewhat often for awhile they had decent chicken wings replaced them with turkey wings then brought chicken wings back to the menu thank goodness my favorite meal has been the sweet potato crusted chicken sandwich which has a nice crunchiness to it without feeling totally disgusting and fried i had high hopes for the fried pickles appetizer but was burned literally the pickles are fried in spears and after many mouth burns i found that they seem to never cool off cutting up the spears wasnt really an option without losing the breading in the process lesson learned service is fine not fast by any means but they get the job done the ladies restroom has two stalls one of which always seems to be out of order in some way this could be due to their sharing bathroom space with the ivory room which sees a lot of rowdy weekend traffic overall buck and badgers atmosphere is cute and cozy and i love sitting near the fireplace in the wintertime give it a whirl wish i would have looked at yelp before i dropped my money here the dining area wasnt very busy my husband and i commented that as we watched the massive crowds outside for maxwell days that should be have been our clue and we found out why service was slow took at least minutes for my husband to get his beer he ordered took a good hour maybe longer to get our food they had about options on their menu i ordered the mad town mac attack with pulled pork for an additional the mac and cheese was disgusting it was noodles not fully cooked with some crappy cheese sauce poured over it like the cheap cheese from a can that gets served with a pretzel i could have bought kraft in a box and been happier the pulled pork after i was through eating it i found a bunch of burned up tin foil go somewhere else}

{36988, Peepshow, 3667 Las Vegas Blvd S The Strip Las Vegas NV 89109, we have seen la reve crazy horse mgm and been to vegas at least times we paid extra to sit in vip thinking it was a big theater and it really was not dont pay extra for vip you are way too close to the stage i would recommend the dollar tickets orchestra let me repeat you get nothing more out of the show sitting in vip the free drink is stupid as well now to the show review i really like that its a variety show dancing live music live singing and all done very tastefully i thought it would be a cheesy naked type show and it really is not i think its great for a couple or a group of friends before hitting the clubs or an after dinner entertainment piece the show is about hours and fully entertaining i gave it stars since im the idiot who paid for vip this is not cirque but a solid show and very entertaining also if you have not been to planet hollywood this place is remodeled and is high energyvery modern this show is ok big stage good songs and fun dancings but i think ticket is overpriced con this show is not for a guy who wanna see many boobs most of girls on the stage cover their boobs during the show pro this is one of las vegas adult shows you can enjoy with your girl friend you wont be sorry to your girl friend hehe she will love this show too wife liked the show more than i did music and dancing were both decent but all i can say is i didnt get it show starts out with the star falling asleep and then it starts into a kind of risque version of nursery rhymes while supposedly having an alternate story of finding true love it just wasnt very cohesive and you might wait until the playboy chica holly madison goes away she was stiff and not very entertaining thankfully as the star she isnt in it very much rumor is that carmen electra is going to replace her which would be a hell of a lot better in my opinion i liked it i really liked it total ta show and thats why i decided to bring the husband to it i was able to get rd row seats for via travelzoo holly madison is so much cuter in person and all the dancers bodies rocked i liked the alice in wonderland theme set to modern sexy music this is definitely a vegas type show topless and entertaining and yes holly madison did take it off too p s kudos to all the dancers having natural boobies i think hollys were the only surgically enhanced i went to the july th show last minute with friends the ticket person said that the only tickets available were front row which i bought since my friends were seated there as well the place wasnt even full as we settled into our seats i saw a savory looking character seated behind us and giving a big hug to the secuirity guy he either got him in or came in on his day off yet it gets better the idiot kept yelling hola behind us throughout the entire show he even yelled a couple of the performers names he continued this behavior throughout the entire show people kept looking back at him and some even left it took security minutes to finally deal with the situation and i think it was solely because he was friends with the head of security it was a good show soured by this experience the only thing that made up for it was when holly came off the stage and stood behind my friend rubbing herself on his head let me get to the point if you are coming to the show simply to see holly madison then you are probably better off buying a playboy mag you will see more of holly she completely disappointed me and thats the only reason my aunt and i came to the show was for her in total she is in about minutes of the hour and half long show she really really cant dance but she is way cuter in person i truly believe she is only in the show because the producers needed a name to add to the show the rest of the cast is very talented all the dancers male and female have great bodies and are very talented dancers actors and singers my favorite part was the milkshake sequence the theatre is very small and intimate if you pay for the cheap tickets and walk in and notice empty seats in the front speak to the male ushers they will most likely hook you up with better seats if you seriously have to see holly madisons tatas in person then go ahead and shell out the ticket price other than that ehhhhh for holly yayyy for the rest of the cast try to get seats in the middle of the theatre was my first burlesque show it was pretty fun the girls were sexy and the theme was well done holly madisons completely void of talent though good thing is the other chicks are hotter and more talented than her so i knew nothing about holly madison before seeing this show in fact my girlfriend decided to pick this show she knew about holly yeah we picked up tickets for around off so they were pretty reasonable the theatre itself is quite nice its not too big but not really tiny i think the seats we got were perfect because we were close enough to the stage to see details but far enough away to see everything the mc was great the singers were really good music selection was good the skits they did were also pretty good the girls were hot as hell now i feel really bad for the cast holly madison is completely talentless she is not funny she cant sing she can barely dance she looks good though and i guess that was enough with her name to get her on this ticket there was on fan who was acting like a stalker screaming her name to the point security was on hand just in case overall this was a pretty classy well done show i dont think id drop the money again to see it but if they can hold the cast for a new show once the talentless one is gone id certainly go see them again we paid like for two tickets to this show and honestly it wasnt even worth that first the seats are really really uncomfortable unless you are a twig i felt bad because there was this big dude and he had to sit on top of the chairs secondly there are poles by where you have to get into your seat so it was hard to even get to the seat now the show iteslf yes there are topless girls but the whole thing was kinda hokey and not very sexy holly was on for like minutes and they guys that were supposedly supposed to be the girls love interests were clearly gay and not really believable it really wasnt anything special and i feel bad for the people who paid full price also if you wanted to meet holly after the show it was what a money hungry you fill in the rest she should want to meet her fans and i really lost respect for her after that dont waste your time or money on this one this show was pretty much a joke we heard the hipe and saw all the signs and figured it would be good it was a super cheesy production i am glad we got our tickets pretty much paid for after going to a stupid time share thing we would have been very very upset if we had to pay for this show both my husband and i really liked this show my only gripe was that the seats were super uncomfortable sucks they didnt change them out when they converted the theater from the stomp setup to the new setup and awkward to get into aside from the crappy chairs the show was really fun we got the row right behind the banquette seating dead center amazing seats so close we could see stretch marks on some of the girls lol anyway fun music pretty good dancing and holly so pretty its true shes not in the show that long which i was bummed about but oh well if theyre going to be switching out celebrities every few months then it wouldnt make sense to have them in the show the entire time lots of marks and choreography to learn in a matter of days it would be difficult for anyone shoshana bean peep diva was amazing great show fun cast and yes my husband and i suckered ourselves into the meet and greet with holly worth every penny were big holly fans oh i was disappointed about the guy that got picked being a plant i agree with another reviewer dont pick someone that looks that unique pick a guy that looks like every other frat boy steve and i went to vegas for his th birthday and this was one of two shows we saw while we were there the other was love i bought these tickets in advance of our trip after weighing our options for a burlesque show and trying to decide between crazy horse paris and this i figured that chp was probably too artsy to be enjoyable for my husband so i went with this knowing it would be considerably cheesier but faster paced and more fun im glad i did he and i both loved it we had great seats centered right behind the banquette seating and right at the end of the catwalk portion of the stage i admit that holly madison was terrible she cannot act tell a joke sing or dance she looked uncomfortable throughout the entire show until the very end when her talent for stripping really shined through shoshana bean the real star of the show is an amazing talent strong solid vocals great dancer and definitely brought some great comedic moments to the show the rest of the cast was also good great dancers and generally just really entertaining performers the casting was really varied in terms of size but all natural i think except for holly we loved it for what it was but its not a show wed be dying to see again either what a jolly good time who doesnt love a lil peep now and then we took our foreign friend to this show and he was alllllllllllll about it singing sexy women costumes breasts and even sexy men im actually proud of aubrey who knew chandelier girl would come so far recently saw peepshow with my wife we sat in one of the tables for at the very front of the main stage we have not been many vegas shows so i cannot say whether it was a good or bad as far topless tease shows go the show was cheezy and kept us very entertained and laughing for hours we both enjoyed the experience and well worth the cost of the tickets be forewarned the cocktail service sucked dont take any chances and get a good buz going before you get to the theater they also had some hoochie at the entrance posing with you for pictures that you could buy at the end of the show dont bother wading through the line to see the pic it costs bucks i saw peepshow with a few friends last sunday i never heard of it but my friends girlfriend wanted to see it there was a lot of boobage most of the women were not attractive though the star aubrey oday really blew up physically after making of the band she use to have a nice body but is now too chubby to be the star of a striptease show holly madison the co star has a really nice body but has not performing talent booked tickets for the peepshow before reading the yelp reviews after i read the reviews i was kind of turned down saw it anyways with my gf and damn it was a good show great performance from all the actors in the show i have to say you people that give it bad reviews are too stuck up if you want to see hot girls go to a damn strip club this is not a erotic porno show for you horny bastards great and cute show i say cute because of the twists on nursery rhymes it is creative just the right amount of sexy and has a couple of scenes with a hot man aha not just women although they do dominate the show as they should i love that there is live music and live singing i went when the part of peep diva was played by shoshana bean but heard from someone that it is great with aubrey o day what was really suprising is that unlike the star of the show at luxor not mentioning any names is that holly madison does remove her top although i would go see this show just because of her it is very entertaining even without them go see this show this was my first vegas show id ever been to i wanted to see it because i love the girls next door obviously i wanted to see holly thats why im sure majority of people bought the same ticket i did as far as the show goes as a whole the music was enjoyable the individual skits were entertaining the girls were great and holly did an ok job performer not so much but she was cute and fun to watch the seating was great i dont think there is a bad seat in there the price of the tickets were overpriced but they do give military or law enforcement discounts which helped greatly this show really surprised me i went with low expectations and came away thrilled it is well conceived fast paced and very entertaining the singers are marvelous and an overall good time it is a little skewed to youth so i expect that younger folks especially girls next door generation will appreciate it more than older folks but was definetly a good time for all this was a nice little show of not overwhelming skill the songs are a mixture of originals and pop hits like that annoying milkshake song there were three female singers and one male none of whom i recognized from anything but all were competent vocalists the peep dancers were good with nice choreography and costumes and without giant silicone cans the weak spot of the show was holly madison she doesnt sing and isnt given much dancing to so the show starts off with a sappy framing device that portrays holly as a clueless sack who cant find love or catch a man which seems ridiculous given what we know of her and the fact that half the male audience yelled her name and encouraging comments toward her bosom whenever she was on stage it was not all boobs all the time tops were removed a good bit into each routine and not at all in a salacious way it was almost innocent there are three featured males in the show a dancer an adorable little patsy and a rope acrobat in wet skin tight clothes you see a male butt which some of the audience males may not have been expecting i was super disturbed by only one routine which featured dancers in a tank of milk or milk and really it was just the milk i objected to overall it was a cute little show and i thought the tickets purchased at the half price booth in the coke bottle were an approximate valuation of the return of the show i agree with another reviewer the chairs were quite uncomfortable with awkward armrests if you want to see lots of breasts go to a strip club if you want to see really skilled semi nude dance see crazy horse at the mgm but not when carmen electra is there as the tickets cast twice as much for the name only if you really just want to see holly madison watch e or buy one of her old playboys because really she is barely in this barely oh ha i get it i debated on what to give peepshow somewhere between and stars there are some good and bad things here mostly bad lets start there they obviously need to make this show start at not they were still seating people up to about then annoying we saw this on friday night so not sure if its just timing or what but the crowd was the most annoying ive ever seen there were a row of or guys a couple rows ahead of us who heckled yelled and screamed the entire show that same group of guys and just about half the rest of the audience got up repeatedly during the show to get drinks or go to the bathroom or whatever the hell they were doing shouldnt the staff not let them back in holly madison might as well have not been in the show she mostly stood around on a corner smiling and swaying on her feet really she didnt sing dance or anything showed her ta tas in a couple shots but that was the extent of her job now the pluses its hard to think of many because of how annoying everything else was the singing and dancing was all right the milk bath was just kinda weird overall it was a fun experience but i cant say how great it would have been were it not for everything else my oh my oh my what do i give peepshow i have thought and thought about this and if i could give half stars i would give it stars but since i cant i will bump it up to stars my debate on the rating is as much about how planet hollywood runs the show as the show itself so here i go the good the show is fun it is a loud crazy high energy hour that gets the audience going also i really like the lobby i know silly but the corset on the ceiling and the peepholes everywhere really work the bad holly madison omg i didnt expect an oscar worthy performance but the girl can barely get a line out she ran into at least dancers she looks like a deer in headlights terrible except for showing her rack she is one totally out of her league the showroom itself the seats are too narrow and the ushers insist on cutting off access to upper seats and making everyone go up the same way which is just crazy not to mention they dont actually show anyone to their seats and let me tell you this audience needed help i have never seen so many people who couldnt find their seats and ushers did nothing the showtime their policies on seating donny clay does a show at p every night and peepshow does a p show every night now let me ask you does that sound like enough time to clear clean and seat between shows it isnt note to planet hollywood move the fucking showtime you idiots it results in everyone cramming into the doors with minutes before showtime and scrambling to find their seats and i already bitched about the ushers and the seats then there is the fact that they dont close the doors they allow people to get up and come and go as they please during the show so during an h show we had at least people get up countless time to refill drinks translation we never had a clear view of the stage wo someones drunk ass not blocking it plus the heckling was out of control you couldnt hear the show half the time with drunk off their ass men hooting and hollering like they were at a strip club yuck and the ushers do nothing they are useless the show the show might be good if you could hear it over the audience there are spots in it that are particularly fun the emerald bikini pole dancer the whole pink number however the distraction of the audience and the lack of any skill by the main attraction holly make this show a bit of a joke it is truly a star show it passes the time but it isnt a great show i agree with diwata p if you want an awesome burlesque show go to the crazy horse you wont be disappointed to be fair there were some things this show had going for it some of the performers were very skilled both at dancing and arousing me with their ample bosoms but overall i left feeling a little disappointed i was so excited to see holly madison but for most of her time on stage she was literally sitting with her back to the audience watching other girls with more stage presence it was amazing to me that she has been the headliner for this show for so long and she still seemed painfully uncomfortable on stage it was sad i think she would have curled up into a little ball if only her enormous breasts didnt render such a move physically impossible overall this is one to miss there just wasnt a whole lot here that was special my husband and i decided it would be fun to head to peepshow for my birthday i wasnt quite sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised the show itself was quite entertaining there are fun songs and dance as well acrobatics it was quite tasteful and a lot of fun to watch i do agree with other reviewers that holly is definitely no actress but i didnt really expect much on that end the other performers were awesome though and it was a great time great show let me start off by saying i have never been to any kind of strip show my wife surprised me with this on a recent trip i didnt know what to expect but i have to say that it was very classy and creative at the same time it was very sensual i thoroughly enjoyed it and will go back a nice cabaret of songs and dance with a mediocre story line but with some fun and funny aspects audience participation is one of the funny parts with a surprise at the end for one of them the girls are all a sight all talented and they all look like theyre having fun i wont lie i think i felt like i had a some fun too if youre staying in ph and have a discount for tickets go its just fun go with low expectations and you will surprisingly have have fun enjoy d part campy entertainment part hot mess first the good the music its actually pretty great singing and the songs were catchy i kinda wanted the cd but they didnt sell it the costumes they are cute very girly the bodies of some of the girls holy cow it felt very much like a victoria secret fashion show these girls are beautiful and have legs that go on for days now the bad holly madison girlfriend cannot actsingdance basically she just stands there i guess thats enough to sell tickets but cant they get a big name that can actually sing or dance kinda boring every act is the same after an hour everyone in the theater started getting antcy checking their blackberry etc not worth the thank goodness we bought the tickets from tix tonight otherwise i would have really wanted my money back if you go to this show i suggest not having alot of expectations and having a couple drinks beforehand you may enjoy the show a bit more i had a buy get coupon so my fiance and i decided to check this show out because of holly i knew it was going to be bad right from the start when the show started minutes late i have never been to a vegas show that started late and it only lasted about minutes long there is really not much to say about the show the singing was not bad but the songs were the dancing was not bad but it got boring very quickly youd think there was a theme to the show little bo peep but there really wasnt and if you think holly was the star youd be greatly disappointed she was barely there for the first of the show she would come out stood there and then faded away holly finally was on the stage in the last minutes or so but poor girl can not dance nor act she pranced around and finally removed her top showing her ginormous boobs unless you really want to see holly naked otherwise pick a nice strip club to go instead youll get more for your bucks there it is all about expectations i saw this show last night with the wife a friend of ours and the sister of our friend for some reason the wife and our friend were under the impression that the show would be sensual and burlesque like crazy horse paris at the mgm well as many reviewers have mentioned its not i am sure the wife would give me crap for a star review i think shed probably go with a but the show completely met my expectations it was cheesy high energy and full of boobs as just about every other review states holly madison really cant dance and she doesnt do much at all the show is really all a huge build up to the very short dance number that holly does topless at the end of the show there were numbers in the show that were more entertaining than others i e pink but most every dance was the same thing with different props the singers werent bad though the male singer was a bit unconvincing i think this would be a great show to start off a night on the town it would also be a good one for a bachelor particularly for those guys not really wanting a strip club experience or bachelorette party this show is all contemporary vegas a facade of glitz glam and is a psuedo celebrity starring flash bomb stars while in vegas i wanted to watch a show i love watching the shows here and am a big fan of musicals as well however the bf isnt quite as interested in shows as i am he fell asleep during a cirque du soleil show and couldnt even remember which one it was i figured that watching a strip show would keep him awake if not entertained we are also both fans of holly madison from the girls next door so i wanted to see her performance we didnt really know what to expect from the show other than the fact that the girls would end up stripping i knew that the storyline was about little bo peep trying to find love however the storyline is just a very loose way to try and tie together all the different performances there is live singing by a trio of girls and one guy there was a lot of energy to the show from the lights music and overall loud ness the dancing was fun to watch and the girls were all good performers while the show was entertaining i was trying to determine how all the different fairy tale characters all fit into the overall theme of finding love while i understood the beginning and end of the show like i mentioned earlier the middle seemed to just be a series of different girls dancing to different songs maybe i was just trying to read further into a show than take it for what it is a fun entertaining high energy show the lower score is due to the fact that hollys part in the show is pretty small for the first half of the show she has a couple lines and then runs around the stage watching the other performers i expected her to be front and center for a lot of the show considering how much prominently her involvement in the show is advertised i just expected to see more of her in the show and no im not talking about seeing her as in her stripping more if youre a fan of holly expecting her to be performing for most of the show youll probably be disappointed traipsing around the stage wasnt what i had in mind i wanted to see her dance the bit of dancing she does in the middle and in the end of the show wasnt enough holly in my opinion it was still an entertaining show however and i still enjoyed the show it was my first adult show after all i saw this show in dec of and there was still a lot of hype about it i saw it with my boyfriend it wasnt the best vegas show but if u like singing and dont mind it being sung by a man with a high pitched voice then i say go for it other than that i could have gave my boyfriend a better peepshow in our giant hotel room save the money and get a playboy magazine youll see more this is an hour of my life that i will never get back i have been to many vegas shows and i have to say i cannot figure out why this one is still running no i know everyone wants to see hollys boobs well you have to wait almost the whole show for that and if you can make it that long thru this train wreck of a show you are a better person than me dont get me wrong there are a few good parts the main guy in the show has an amazing voice some of the pole work was very impressive but the show itself is absolutely ridiculous i thought there would be a point to show but apparently there isnt the milk bath grossed me out the routines were ridiculous i have one friend that leaned over during the show and said i dont get it did that car just burn off her clothes yes its that ridiculous what does a car have to do with little bo peep anyway i didnt go into this with high expectations and my expectations were not met at all apparently word has spread that the show sucks because the theatre wasnt even full i say skip this and see another cirque and im not a huge fan of those either i feel like if youve seen one youve seen most of them but id much rather have gone to love or viva elvis i have never been to a strip show before but being my first time it was great the music was really good overall a very entertaining show i would have wished holly would have done more then her little parts she has in it but the rest of the cast was great i would definently recommend to go and see it this show was all over the place except in bad which it almost stayed at throughout ive seen better looking and just better dancers at other shows i only enjoyed one segment josh sings with a girl in green the rest were just poor adolescent excuses disguised as ideas for the show josh one of the lead singers has a great voice and can really sing hard to not like him but he is mostly wasted in this show holly is barely in the first half of the show and i was a bit surprised that she still seems stiff on stage like its her first performance frankly if you just want to see her boobs which is the big and very brief ending you are better off just looking her up on the internet if you really want a sensual experience go see zumanity if you want to see hot women dance go to a strip club youll get far more for your money and entertainment then here i think if you are drunk it might be stars like really drunk and high too yeah you should definitely be high thank god i only paid half price i swear this show was created by someone whose daughter is a stripper and they didnt want her doing the stripping gig anymore so they tried to clean it up and put it with the big name and big tits of holly madison the show was cheeseball and a half the whole premise is lil bo peep falls asleep and has dreams about all these women in fantasy land who are trying to land a man ick the singing is pretty good but not fantastic there are only two people in this show with real talent the one girl who wears green and comes out and does some real pole tricks and talent and the other is an audience member timber he actually does rope tricks and is strong as hell he was hot and knew his shit holly left things to be desired she cant really dance and her hair is complete straw over processed and might as well be an entire weave she has a very pretty face though i would not recommend wasting your money on this gig i was even in one of the vip seats with a table there was a bachelorette party there that looked like they wanted to eat my beau alive with a fork and knife crowd gross theater gross the women who are in this show have pretty rockin bodies and some probably do have real talent on the pole but its not a traditional burlesque show so i found it too cheesy without any stellar performance behind it i was one of the lucky yelp peeps to get free ticket to see the viva elvis show at aria and norm k one of the yelp elite member and overall great guy offered one of his extra ticket to peepshow so i was able to go check it out for free woot anyway lets get down to business the peep show theater is located inside planet hollywood which i am not familiar with and the website does not seem to offer a floor plan i drove and parked in the miracle mile garage which is probably the best way to go if you have access to a car while visiting las vegas once inside the miracle mile shops which is basically shaped like a circle just walk through the mall until you get to the entrance of the casino of planet hollywood after that take the escalator to the second floor and you will see the peep show theater which is very prominent and difficult to miss they have some basic rules absolutely no photography or video recording inside the theater you are advised to turn off your cell phone and remove the battery from your camera they say that they will come after your ass if you are caught filming or taking pictures or if you uploaded the video to youtube so post it to facebook and only share it with your friends p premise for my review i didnt read any reviews prior to seeing the show and have only seen the promotional videos playing on the big screens on las vegas blvd i have only seen cirque du soleil shows and jersey boys i like holly madison when she was still hefs gf so the good music is better than i had expected and one of the backup singer is pretty hot herself is she a filipina even compared to the peep show dancers songs were catchy dancers all have pretty nice figures and some were just super nice very impressed with the abs of steel on the rd little piggy the milk performance inside the giant tank was pretty cool it will be very difficult for me to drink milk and not remember the sensual visuals in the future did i mention that one of the singer is very pretty and has a knock out body rope act by one of the audience was cool but nothing spectacular relative to the ones performed in cirque du soleil acts the not so good holly madisons part in the show very limited in scope mostly looking pretty and walking around the stage while the peep show girls performed didnt care for the blinding light near the beginning of the show when all the dancers were being introduced premise of the show is kind of weak but i guess it is like watching soft core porn in that you watch it for the suggestive sexuality in this case the topless nudity and the plot is an afterthought the singers never joined in the topless portion of the act hey i can dream too therefore my rating is stars mostly because i still am a fan of holly madison but it would be great if her role in the performance is increased i have been wanting to see this show for some time this would be the final act in seeing all the topless shows in las vegas finishing this task though a chore would be my crowning achievement enter a friend who offered to give me two tickets yes the price is right and im set to go my wife is not a late show person so i met a fellow yelpie tony t at the peepshow theatre at planet hollywood last night i was not disappointed the premise of the show is a bit weak i guess with a show like this i really didnt plan on going for the story line so this wasnt too much of a drawback holly madison is gorgeous her role is limited to brief appearances to move the story along in the last scene we get to see the real madison and its worth the wait the music is quite good there are some very good singers on that stage the feelin good number is very well done the scene with timber is excellent his strength is amazing finally the one scene that was the best for the night was the giant milk bath the three ladies in the vat were quite good this part of the show was quite clever and it was staged beautifully it brought a big smile to my face got milk id go again to see this show the ladies are quite pretty and the vibe of the place is so las vegas edit after reading tony ts review i remembered i wanted to mention being totally blinded near the beginning of the show when the dancers stand in front of a huge peepshow lighted display that is so bright you are literally blinded for a second then the dancers become dark figures in the bright light our first show in vegas my wife liked it and i almost fell asleep holly madison was barely in the show it is pretty obvious that she doesnt have the skill of the other dancers she also is getting really thick no wonder hef wasnt into her anymore nothing against her personally but the fake breasts fake tan fake smile and fake hair are a little much she looks good for a mid s lady from vegas i went to see holly madison at her best topless you only get a glimpse of that other than that i found the show to be entertaining i enjoyed them gettin the crowd involved the other girls knew what they were doing but its very obvious they all have a fall back job in stripping if the show closes i really enjoyed this show i was weary at first because of the bad reviews but i had such a good time my friends and i were laughing throughout the show its definitely a treat for both men and women our guy friends thought it would be a femmie show but its so sexy topless girls splashing in milk pole dancing and riding a pony swing blindfolded awesome i felt that the show had the same intentions as cirques zumanity but peepshow is wayy better music is fun too they take a twist on music we all know and love yes holly madison was a huge disappointment but whatevs shes still cool in my book we got tix at the coke bottle tiks booth that morning for each and they werent bad at all still in the mezzanine and in perfect view of everything for a lot cheaper than what it normally goes for id definitely watch it again the wife watched the girls next door editorial side note bridget marquardt all the way and now hollys world since i can hear the tv while doing so i guess i also watch it by proxy while in vegas the wife expressed interest in seeing the show and we happened to obtain a coupon for tickets the show itself was disappointing and all over the place much like the other reviews here let me tell you why the good and bad for a show called peepshow staring holly madison there is hardly any holly when holly is on the stage mostly just standing around looking pretty she seems a bit awkward and out of place the funny thing is when she is on stage my attention fell to her and i would forget there were other performers on stage she does look incredible even if she wasnt my favorite gnd the shows plot is a mess ok i get that holly falls asleep and is dreaming that she is transported into the nursery book she was reading as little bopeep i was expecting a recreation of the various nursery book stories with the various girls what i did get was a mess of a production that had little to nothing to do with the premise of the show ie wtf milk shake number and do we really have to hear that god awful song twice in the show the seats in this place have to be the most uncomfortable thing i have ever sat in think coach airplane seat but narrower best part of the show was the setup with the audience member timber that part was actually laugh out loud funny josh can sing feeling good a personal favorite and he can belt it out the other singers trio of women are really good as well ginuwine pony really lol all in all the show was just meh ok i dont think i would recommending it to anyone unless you are a die hard gnd or hollys world fan and just want to see her ill still give it stars boo on you yelp reviewers my daughter and i went to see the show last night and loved it we thought holly was adorable and looked amazing why cant you all say something nice about her we didnt expect to see merly streep for god sakes it is a vegas show we were very entertained and got exactly what we expected hollys sweet personality comes over on to the stage go see a broadway play if your expectations are so high ps we saw enough of holly too she did all she needed to do it needs to be said holly madison cant dance and she apparently cant sing as she doesnt even make an attempt in peep show despite her complete lack of talent she has a cute personality and apparently her name draws in the crowd fortunately there is very little of holly madison in this show and what is left is pretty great all of the numbers minus the awful car scene with the singer screeching through the song are fantastic the nudity is kind of an afterthought which is a good thing you can tell that the choreography and music were given a lot of thought the host of the show dont know her name and josh strickland make this show i would see it again just for his voice he is truly an amazing singer and so sexy some audience interaction was pretty hilarious too overall this show was really entertaining and i would definitely recommend it definitely look for a deal on tickets i got a sweet deal maybe i would have felt differently had i paid full price for tickets lame routines and mediocre dancing im sure dancing topless was their aim to distract viewers from noticing the sub par dancing holly never speaks a word and this black chick and white dude do all the singin and talking for the view would be pretty good but for the view is hardly worth going for still for dancing tits is debatable i couldnt understand why everyone was so pumped to see this show and even more so when holly showed her boobs or someone did something sexy sorry fake boobs and small b cups just didnt impress me save your money go see la reve at the wynn amazing just like the wynn i would give this awful show zero stars holly madison for the majority of the show makes it out on stage for a minute at a time story line makes no sense at all its full of cheesy musical numbers and a lame audience plant holly makes the big reveal and gives her big dance number at the end of the show and it doesnt redeem it at all a quote from my husband was i never thought i would be bored of boobs i would advise anyone from spending their hard earned money on this show i can think of a million different ways i would have liked to have spent our always always look for discount tickets i got mine at of face value and still had great seats other reviewers hit the holly doesnt do much and ill agree but she looks more like a real woman than i had possibly imagined and it was a fun show overall some burlesque stuff that you want see at a strip club and parts of the show are hot josh strckland is the true star of the show if hes still in it the show is still worth seeing peepshow was an ok show i wouldnt have spent full price on a ticket which i didnt but i would have paid something it was a bit slow in the beginning and the plot was a bit dull but who needs plot in a topless show my thoughts exactly my favorite was ms petes number when i was watching her i realized that she was my favorite dancer from the now closed forty deuce either i have an eye for talent or half naked women lol i also enjoyed the milkshake routine i thought the tub o milk was used in a very smart way holly madisons part was a joke she barely was in the show which was fine by me since i was never much of a fan however i will give her credit for being able to get on stage and bare it all when all the other girls have amazing dancer bodies coming from northern california where there is quite a bit of entertainment options i was somewhat spoiled in the frequency and affordability of incoming concerts and performers so once i moved to vegas i felt like i knew what entertainment was i was so very wrong it was like being a kid that has been at fat camp all summer long enjoying all the fun activities while munching some celery and then being given a welcome home party at the local piggly wiggly overwhelmed not only was i completely overwhelmed with all of the choices the prices made absolutely no sense at all once i got to know a few people i began to here the buzz of all the shows on the strip one of them happened to be peepshow now when your walking down the strip after a few beers okay i meant to write a few too many beers and your wife sees you looking at the peepshow advertisement and simply says i wouldnt mind seeing that the drunk guy paranoia kicked in my subconscious began asking myself is she serious the answer is yep learning that a very good friend of mine at my place of business has a wife that is a independent executive casino marketing representative for all of the harrahs properties and she is very very good at what she does this was a very intriguing piece of knowledge i am not a taker so it never crossed my mind to ask for any comps or special treatment of any kind but last week was a little different the wife is having her birthday and i figured why not take her to a show we would like linda that is the harrahs rep and myself made a trade my services for her services and let me tell you it was more than worth it our seats at the show were close enough that it made us feel like we were in a old school pac bell commercial it made you just want to reach out and touch somebody waiting for the show start the cocktail waitress came and took our order whiskey on the rocks please as soon as i took the first few sips of the drink the bright glow of the peep show brought the room to life the girls in the show are all fairly attractive woman and all do an amazing job throughout the entire show now like many of the other reviewers has mentioned you would really think that holly is going to be all over that stage shakin that thang but that is not the case she hops around looking cute for a majority of the show and about minutes prior to the end she frees the prisoners and at that point you would think the crowd was a group of bounty hunters looking for there first bounty that theater erupted with cheers the vocalists were all absolutely amazing i have to say they pull off the live singing better than some other acts i have seen i think the show is pretty good and would be an amazing break from any gamblers binge how can you go wrong with a cold drink and nice set of stage props in your face all kidding and prison jokes aside i think this show is worth seeing it does have a somewhat struggling story line but the stage effects and overall performance was awesome also as a side not if your a player and need a harrahs hotel rep to help you plan your trip and make things easier on you so you can enjoy the finer things in vegas like seeing holly madison hop around the stage dont settle for less contact linda pierro and tell her your buddy raymond said she is the best www lindapierro com and that i recommended peepshow vip seating yay well actually we were supposed to be in the first row but there were people sitting in our seats because we showed up late we got placed at the vip tables instead which were right under the stage so im glad we showed up late i missed the beginning minutes of the show but i think the whole plot is that little bo peep holly gets talked through by the peep diva into becoming a more sensual confident person so she can get herself a man the show takes you through a bunch of fairytale plots and it was okay its a peepshow so you dont really need much of a story line i liked that they had audience interaction through out the show it kept you in the loop and interested its hard to believe that holly madison is the star of this show considering she barely appears dances and never sings i think she had a total of maybe lines if that but she is a celebrity and obviously the reason why the whole theatre was packed the main male lead vocalist josh strickland in my book is the true star of the show he has an amazing voice and is sexy as hell and on top of that has amazing stage presence and charisma i kept waiting for scenes with him in it its really too bad he swings the other way if you dont mind that the star of the show doesnt really perform come see this show there is definitely a lot of topless women and if that is what you want to see this show is it along with great songs that makes you want to sing along youll become a fan tip purchase discount tickets because i dont think its worth full price even better if you know a local have them purchase it for you its bucks for them just spend the weekend in sin city and i wish i had stayed in planet hollywood instead of the luxure hotel i spend the entire time in planet hollywood the atmosphere is great the food is great and they have the peepshow which is my favorite show in vegas if you are in vegas i recommend you to see this show its worth your money and its very entertaining i have seen the show since its inception and multiple times as the cast changed i have to say it is a pretty good show i love the singers and josh strickland is a good male lead for a show full of titilating performers as i have said ive seen it since kelly monaco and mel b were the stars they did a very good job when they introduced holly madison to the cast it was a great addition when aubrey oday was peep diva she added a spunkier attitude to her role we saw the current limited edition run of the show with holly madisons friend angel porrino from what we saw she did a very good job she has more rhythm than holly thats for sure i also appreciate how they change the contents of the show to be fresh every time either by adding more singing parts for their cast or a change up with the songs they perform to showcase the headliner the show is always a contender for a burlesque show the fresh reinventions and the performance are worth the money to go and see it this show was llllllaaaammmmeeeee i was sooo disappointed and totally wish i would have looked here before going to see peep show if youre looking for a sexy or nude show go see x burlesque or zumanity the rest of the reviews here are pretty right on except i thought joshs singing was a little adam lambertish more like screaming and really bad everyone else here is being too nice this was a great way to end a fabulous weekend in vegas i did not know what to expect i first thought holly was going to do some serious dancing and truly be the star of the show not so she briefly came out for each number but the real stars were the professional dancers and singers you go josh its all about the music we all enjoyed the music and had great seats close enough to see holly and some of the cellulite nothing wrong with that i do have to say that she needs dance lessons and stage presence there were numbers that brought us to our feet we had to remember that were not in a club here glad to see that the ladies were all natural except for holly but shes the playmate in the scheme of things if someone wanted to see the show and dragged me out with them id probably come out to see it again i only read playboy for the articles interviews i would say peepshow was a fun adult vegas show because jackie and i have seen the e girls next door show a few times on tv holly madison is the prettier of the girls albeit all with a little help of a plastic surgeon enhanced we went on a monday night so the seat auditorium was half empty no worries but it would have been nice if they allowed us to move down closer to the show our tickets were fees i had my expectations of peepshow and it was cool with the nursery rhyme spin offs all in all it was entertaining we had our favorite skits and showgirls girl on the pole and the girl on the bear rug was gorgeous btw holly is barely in the singing and dancing part shes kind of just a hostess through the show you get to see holly topless yes along with most of the other girls too gals there are two guys that also share the stage if youre wondering well the girls i went with liked this more than the guys its not what its billed to be honestly if you want to see naked girls just go to a strip club this was just a big waste of time and the star of the show holly madison doesnt really do much except walk around and talk i was bored derek such a fun experience i went with my friend holly madison is in the majority of the show you do get to see many boobs the girls come in all different shapes and sizes it was nice to know that they didnt just pick size dancers a great time this is a entertaining burlesque show that has holly madison as a side interruption holly madison truly has no talent she cannot act she cannot sing and she even has a gut compared to the rest of the dancers my favorite dancer is the girl in green she is by far the best pole dancer and can accurately perform all the numbers with ease the second is the teddy bear dancer well she can dance and sing really well the show is for a fun light hearted evening and not for the people who are looking for deep plot or great acting is just for fun not a show that will leave you thinking about the ending cough up the and have a good time dont expect more than that your in vegas baby good for kids oh yea bring your kids and get them started on the birds and the bees a little earlier in life to reduce future confusions peepshow starring holly madison more like peepshow and a little of holly for a ticket i would have thought she was really a part of the show and i know the title should give it away but really how many breasts can be hanging out when they came out they said there would be some men so the lead male singer was pretty hot and the lead female had an incredible voice the show so not all that i could not figure out the story line at all so holly is looking for love and then some fairy tale stories thrown in with some singing and dancing and topless women they could have kept their tops on and it would have been better i know it is vegas but come on holly never sang or danced she just pranced around in her robe which almost seemed like she was very self conscious of her belly because she was always holding it strange strange strange not a repeat guest i will be this was about i enjoyed the girls next door and was curious where holly would take this she did well even though she didnt have a huge role in the whole thing but could definitely use some poise and dance lessons the storyline was all over the place but it didnt phase me too much after all you totally go see a peepshow for the storyline right the main diva and the trio of diva singers were pretty amazing my only gripe peepshows normally barely lets you see everything and the mystery and the almosts are sexy and erotic but to be all bare all and jiggle them around is more stripper than peepshow it loses its allure overall the show was enjoyable taking a risque spin on some old nursery rhymes with strip teases dancing and music maybe they should rename it substarring holly madison alright so this show had everything you could want girls dancing in a giant tub of milk struggling vocal artists just waiting for the moment to try and steal the show and a d list celebrity what more could anyone ask for actually it wasnt the worst but i am sure glad we didnt pay for tickets the best part was with timber that in itself earned it the third star for me perhaps our experience was because holly was out this week but from other reviews it seems as if that wouldnt have made much of a difference this show was silly the story made no sense the whole appeal was that the women were walking around nearly naked for youd have more fun at at actual strip club in minutes than the whole hour and a half of peep show the positive parts were that the singing talents were quality and the jest with the boy timber was comical but its just topless ness everywhere and poor story line not to mention that holly madison needs to hit the gym maybe its because i had really low expectations for the show maybe its because i like tits and ass but i thought this show was pretty good much better than i thought it was going to be plenty of other reviews trash holly for being talentless and fat the former is true her dancing seems stiff and lacks any sense of rhythm our seats were close to the back row so i couldnt get up close and personal with her but she looked good to me but again its all about expectation she looked better than i thought she would make no mistake though shes curvier than almost every girl in the show and has the biggest rack all the dancers look really thin athletic and natural the show itself was cheesy but entertaining some of the dancing was good some skits funny and the singing was good for the most part there was one girl who did some cool pole tricks there were some parts that fell flat but for the most part it was enjoyable if you want nothing but ta go to a strip club if you want a sexy and seductive show you might want to check out something else if you want death defying stunts see a cirque show but if campy entertainment is your thing give this a shot great show not to expensive holly madisons role is so great great experience well we visited peepshow last friday night and it was pretty good holly was great everything i expected from her i was a little disappointed that josh wasnt there to perform but his understudy was good the story was a little hard to follow at first but overall it was pretty good my husband enjoyed the nudity we would go again but i would probably just do the meet and greet with holly holly barely speaks and dances in this show she doesnt sings at all the rest of performers are good the shows premise is cool youll see boobies a few dozen of them a few times during the show theres a striptease in the show thats pretty cool a skit with the milkshake song that puts school milk cartons in a while different light and a scene with a big white teddy bear thats cute it was a good show not worth the though those were the cheap seats too id say for the expensive seats would be ok and that josh guy wasnt there i was looking forward to him maybe the shows dynamic was different because he wasnt there i saw peepshow on our last night in vegas i had been looking forward to seeing this show ever since i found out i would be going to vegas i love holly madison and the girls next door so this show was a must the show was great like previous reviews people mentioned holly was more of an accessory than the star when in reality the headliner of a vegas show like this is generally more of a teaser and doesnt appear in the whole thing knowing this before you go is a plus having said that holly was adorable and even prettier in real life which i wasnt expecting the segments that stick out in my mind were milkshake pony and the one where a girl made her way across the stage dancing around various stripper poles cant recall the song she danced to also anyone else who saw this show did you recognize one of the dancers as being on a former reality show the tall brunette in milkshake one of the three main dancers who was on the right i know she was in something else and i just cant put my finger on it please let me know if you have answers all in all even though i really enjoyed the show i had to take away two stars for three reasons the first one being the merchandise sold wasnt very good options were limited tshirts were overpriced and the material was so thin the hoodies seemed to be made in mens sizing but for women so i couldnt find one that fit and i was willing to pay the price if it did we ended up getting a magnet shotglass and postcard none of which had prices marked on them so we had to keep asking the not very nice sales girl how much everything was very disappointing complaint number two is the seating holy cow ive never sat in seats so narrow my boyfriend who is about lbs soaking wet even felt cramped complaint number three anyone who watched hollys world is familiar with josh strickland hollys friend and the male singer of peepshow however he was noticeably absent they did have a replacement and i will say his voice was amazing but i was looking forward to seeing josh almost as much as holly so it was a bummer that he wasnt there i have to admit that i had no idea who holly madison was before seeing this show but i had some clients who were dying to see it so i bought the best seats that were still available which werent vip but the next section up the seats were good even though they were one of the front rows on the second level the dancing and choreography was ok the singing was good but i agree with all the other reviews that holly was pretty much useless i would have thought this show was pretty good if i had seen it in atlanta ga but it definitely was not up to vegas standards holly showed her boobs a couple of times and strutted back and forth across the stage a few times but other than that the show could have gone on without her if seeing holly is your only reason for wanting to see this show then you are going to be disappointed oh and the whole nursery rhyme theme with the boobs just didnt go together it was actually kind of creepy the audience member timber was very talented he was a great actor and was pretty convincing as an audience member then he did some rope tricks in the bathtub scene that was cool the girl in green who plays ms pete pretty much made me turn gay for about minutes she was awesome although the third little piggy who danced to brickhouse might have made me turn a little gay too and lest i forget the milk scene was cool i will give them that it wasnt horrible i was just disappointed in it for ticket for ticket it might have gotten a higher rating because my expectations would have been lower i would recommend seeing another vegas show holly madison is the name point on the headlines for this but she is just pure cameo the singing and dancing was ok and overall it was worth the money for vegas style entertainment enough comedy mixed in to make it fun for everyone my best friend and i were going to vegas for her bday and shes never been before she really wanted to go see holly madison because of her show and i said i would go along i like holly but she cannot dance i thought the story line was stupid i dont particularly like seeing topless girls but the dancing was really nice and i enjoyed the music i rate this a bc i got the ticket for dollars at the half price ticket place i would rate this a if i paid a full fare on this holly madison does absolutely nothing in this show she doesnt even seem interested in being there she just prances around shes much thinner in the poster ad too oops did i say that i got free tickets to this through a friend of a friend of a friend that works at the planet hollywood ticket booth cool after seeing this inane show and thinking of the people that just paid to see this show not cool holly madison looks gorgeous but you only see her a total of like minutes combined in this minute show you only see her ta tas a total of like seconds max boo tip from me the ushers at the theater are pretty laid back and there are parts during the show where they pretty much black out the theater to make transitions on stage this is where you can be ghetto fab and get up upgrade your seat rows ahead of you be good to yourself enjoy the limelight while you can holly the only reason this show is getting even one star is because of josh his voice was amazing i wish i would have been able to see him in a show that was actually worth seeing though this is the most horrible show ive ever seen i was more mad about wasting my time than wasting the money there was no story line and you only see holly for a couple seconds the whole audience looked more confused than entertained i would definitely recommend seeing any other show in vegas dont waste your time with this one should be renamed peep show feat josh strictland he and the female lead singer totally keep the show going the dancers are all really fit athletic and convincing holly simply shuffled around the stage clutching her robe shut and looking insecure by all means she is not fat that being said though the rest of the cast made her look really amature she needs to step it up and rock it out like the others do especially since its her show nothing against her but dancing is just not her thing for me on a positive note the comical relief of timber is also a highlight and holly was very cute there because she looked a lot more comfortable long story short confusing story line but whos going for the story right great singing and overall fun show just go into it thinking its a peep show and not the holly madison peep show not the greatest show but hey it was free and what is up with this holly madison chick is she supposed to be part of the show because i waited all night and she never made that min appearance everyone talks about but whatever because her friend was way hotter anyway good thing about the show is they have a cool hostmcsinger who kept the crowd involved its fun when you bring a bunch of friends or else it would have been a star for me choreography was ok nothing really special and they danced topless half of the time so if youre a guy thats unfortunately never seen many titties in your life well maybe this might be a star show for you josh strickland the male singer was really the only talented singer there without him this show would really have gone downhill there were plenty of seats still left so make im sure you can find great deals on tix instead of having to pay full price for it because its definitely not worth the full admission you want partial nudity that comes with real talent and entertainment i suggest you watch zumanity or if you just want nudity this is vegas im sure youll find a strip bar around the corner somewhere upon reading other reviews i wonder did we all see the same show i can see if your drinking too much you may not catch on to the story of the show so here it is the story is of a beautiful women unsure of herself in the ways of romance sex appeal etc this journey thru her dreams and finding that self confidence its based on fairy tales red riding hood little pigs bo peep holly madison i for one will never look at those stories the same way again d both my husband and i really enjoyed the show the energy was great the music wonderful all the women beautiful and the dancing well put together all the vocals were outstanding and i just love josh i would buy his music love to have all the numbers he sings in the show yes its topless sexual and fun loved joshs version of pony and timber was awesome its not humping down and dirty grinding if thats what you want then go to a strip club or call the number on all the cards passed out on the strip if you want to enjoy sexuality beautiful women good music and have fun its a must see by the way holly is in it quite a bit not just minuets and is topless twice i would go see it again and recommend it saw the show on thursday night show looked as if it was sold out didnt see many empty seats tiers of prices we went with the rd price st being most expensive doesnt really matter what seats you decide on no matter where you sit your going to get a good view the show alot of dancing and singing josh hollys friend was outstanding very good singing and put on a great show most of the girls were beautiful topless nudity timber was awesome i see people complain about holly not being in the show much but come on now yea its her show and all but people come just to see her in general she isnt going to be out on the stage all night topless i mean she has her own show on e wifey watches it religiously she was in the show on and off but enough to the point where i was satisfied especially at the end oh my she is gorgeous and what a great ass lol tips arrive mins early there is a bar just to the right of where you enter they are strict on no cameras restrooms are near the bar and you may get up if needed in the middle of the show to use them i would love to see the show again i saw this show when i first moved to vegas and it was the first vegas show i had ever seen i sadly paid full price during some drunken decision the show was half full and i did not know what to expect the show is primarily musical topless adult nursery story show it also features holly madison every now and then showing her boobs overall the show was decent but not worth a ticket also do not expect to see holly much because she is only in of the show to show to show them tatas as much as i dislike using text speak peepshow can only be described as wtf was that after meeting and taking a cute pic with holly madison in the am she said so herself that it was cute shut up i figured the only logical thing to do was take in her show i fooled myself thinking it could be more than it actually was really holly just walks back and forth onstage tossing her jugglies around and giving the audience a couple of peek a boos for our time and yes theyre nice if youre wondering there was lots of singing and dancing and there were parts where it was pretty good but most of it didnt make sense the scene with timber was entertaining but for the most part it was just odd i mean its a supposed to be a sultry and sensual update on nursery rhymes kid fairy tales topless girls in a show loosely based on little bopeepred riding hood little pigs and others thats odd in itself i dont know what any of these people are talking about peepshow was amazing after reading these reviews i didnt know what to expect but i still wanted to go because i love holly i was definitely not disappointed at all holly was on stage for the majority of the show and she looked great josh has an amazing voice and the rest of the cast was hilarious and were all extremely talented dancers you should all ignore the people below because the show was definitely worth going to and i would go to see it many more times love holly and peepshow omg this show was one of the best shows in vegas im sort of cheesy i like holly madison and think hef is a fool for letting that one go but her show is definitely a must see in las vegas in the planet hollywood hotel and casino lots of energy and a lot of fun purchased one of the inexpensive seats and tipped one of the hosts a bill and voile we got a seat up close and personal could reach out and touch one of the dancers if bf wanted to it was great from start to finish if you do not like nudity then dont go but this show is very tasteful funny and one of the better ones in vegas i loved the show maybe because im a big fan of holly and love the girls next door and hollys world it was so surreal for me to see her on stage in person i really liked the story of the show its a great show for a couple to see because it caters not only to men but women too for the storyline my favorite scene was the girl in green who was dancing on the pole i take pole dancing at the gym and its pretty hard so i give her stars for being so athletic and sexy at the same time i went with the boyfriend and we both agreed that was the best part of the show josh strickland has a great voice hes like the christina aguilera in her peak of las vegas you do get to see holly a lot at the end and shes topless but i wish she was more active in the show especially because she seems like she would be the lead based on posters and billboards i would say everyone has somewhat of an equal role if anything when you watch the show you can tell who should be the lead of the show the girls are super skinny i can understand why they would want holly to loose weight compared to them when i when to see her show i thought her body was fine especially for the men who dont like super skinny girls the show was good but if you are going to see holly madison dont bother she really doesnt do anything seemingly her name is on the show to truly sell tickets only props to the supporting cast love the show josh did a good job timber was a funny part holly looks hot and topless its a lot of skin in show we enjoyed the show and we recommend to go see the show worth it doesnt matter where you seat youll get a view i didnt know much about holly madison but my girlfriend for some reason watches her on tv and wanted to see the show it is a ridiculous juvenile story and a jumble of odd dance numbers and lousy music i think it was supposed to be erotic or sexy but its just an excuse for women to hop around topless holly looks to have an iq of about but shes attractive enough im not sure what talent she is supposed to have another woman acts as the hostess or emcee shes dressed like a reject from a science fiction show on cable worse she talks in an urban slang and thinks the f word is a classy way to add to spark to a sentence so she only cheapens an already half sleazy act it is really a bland lowest common denominator presentation if holly wasnt on tv and the dancers were clothed the theater would be empty save your money i want my bucks back dh and i have been to see quite a few risque vegas shows and this was the most disappointing please take your money and see something better maybe a cirque show or fantasy at the luxor the audience participation part of the show was a cast member and the only highlight was the hostess lead singer she was amazing as for holly though any girl with a decent body a blonde wig and a set of fake tits couldve starred in this we had a great time would see it again in some ways it was what i was expecting in others it wasnt my husband i went to celebrate our yr anniversary we also met her after the show she is wonderful would recommend for anyone to watch the music was the draw of the show by far the skits were cute and hot holly madison only makes small short visits on stage so if you are going solely to check her out you will not be satisfied when she is on stage she is so cute skipping about she is slender yet jiggly at the same time love that beautiful women in this show as well i would see it again but bext time get vip seating my milkshake brings all the guys to the yard yes i want a milk bath warning if attending this show make sure you get vip only otherwise you will be stuck in the back with all of the other punished school kids like i was horrible save your money the worst show ive ever seen i enjoyed the peep show more than many cirque du soleil shows that ive seen at vegas especially love i am not a fan of holly madison but i liked how they changed the fairy tale story of red ridding hood three little pigs and bo pee but my favorite is still zumanity it was a cute show but for those that only heard holly madison listen to the striptease part of the description i totally didnt realize that it was just act after act of girls in sexy outfits taking it off not even dancing all the time i wasnt offended or grossed out as it wasnt trashy looking at you pussycatdolllounge i just couldnt believe thats what i signed up for i sat in the nd rd row on the right side so i had a good view of a few girls up close and holly as she sauntered by its true she doesnt dance until the end of the show but she does show up to play a small part in almost every scene it was really exciting to see holly in person being a fan of the original girls next door i had been waiting for the milk scene after reading the reference so many times i think i watched in a little bit in shock haha enjoy i had a beer down in the casino before i headed into the show so i cant comment on the in house drinksdrink service wanted to do a show wanted to do a show that was adult ended up watching peepshow good show mix of alot of various entertainment comedy acrobats magic lots of singing dancing acting hot girls and nudity in a tasteful somewhat tease manner eyecandy for the ladies as well not totally just a mans show for all girls or so worth seeing holly madison is damn gorgeous in person go peep it out and find out for yourself i just moved to vegas and had been watching hollys world since the beginning so i could not wait to see peepshow im a huge fan of holly josh and angel too my review is bitter sweet josh is the real star of the show holly has no talent she does nothing except show her boobs twice i caught myself yawning like times do not pay for meet and greet this was the biggest waste of money ever my husband was sweet enough to surprise me with meeting her and it was very disappointing she was wearing a pink baggy sweat suit with her hair in a bun ok people why do i look better than holly i was expecting her to come out in costume at least so i could have a cute picture everyone gathers at the front of the stage you wait for her to come out toast some champagne stand in line and wait for your turn for her to say who do i sign the photo to and you get one shot with your camera i was really bummed i wish josh would have come out instead i got a better picture with the poster in the lobby holly clearly did not want to be there she looked bored and was totally fake the show needs to end too she was just going through the motions i just moved to vegas and my girlfriend came out to visit so my wonderful husband got vip tickets for peep show we had pm seating so no meet and greet at this show but we still enjoyed the beverage service and drinks were good our seats were awesome all the girls in the show are beautiful josh is amazing i did read here that some people didnt like the show but we both really enjoyed i guess you cant please everyone boobies lots of boobies i really wanted to see this show because i loved watching holly madison on her reality show hubby wanted to see the show because of holly and the all the boobies the show wasnt too bad the singers were good dancers were good holly was literally eye candy for the show she didnt do much she popped in and out in every scene but she did sing and that was just ok this is my first boobie show that ive ever seen so i cant really make any comparison but i did enjoy the show we had great seats and i bought hubby a program with holly as the centerfold gosh every single girls were so hot and holly was amazing and beautiful as always i expected more from her but what can i say she not a dancer nor a actress but overall i think everyone did a amazing job this show was awesome i received comp tickets and wasnt aware that it was a topless review but i rolled with the punches we sat in the front row and had a great view the dancers are all really fit and toned and i left vowing not to touch another carb to put myself on some sort of dancer workout ladies if you have any insecurity about having your man watch hot chicks dance around you might want to leave him in the casino holly madison doesnt do a lot of dancing but in all honesty the womans a reality show start not a professional dancer she pops on and off stage for cameos while the other dancers and josh do their thing overall it was a great show and i would recommend it i dont often write reviews i only write when i disagree with other yelp reviews or if there are rarely any reviews for the subject i am going to keep this one short and sweet i am a big holly madison fan i think she is gorgeous to be able to see her in person at the show was a real treat the show was very entertaining and i highly recommend it other reviews avg stars for this show well i think not this show really deserves a stars but i will round off and give it a helpful tip if anyone is planning to see this show be sure to book it early to get good seating and might as well get the vip seat for a little bit more money because you get so close to the stage that you almost get to touch the performers i loved peepshow because of all of the poor yelp reviews i went in with low expectations ive been a follower of the girls next door for ages and hollys always been my favorite i have to agree that it was a treat to see her perform even if her role wasnt a huge one i squealed a little when she appeared josh strickland is one amazing vocal artist i was completely blown away by his performance and id hate to imagine peepshow without him im not even sure they could pull it off he carried the entire show and i adore him for his vocal power loved the music loved most of the acts never got bored and found myself rockin out with the upbeat music my husband really liked the show as well opt for better tickets as the lower priced seating is not comfortable the usher directed us to the wrong place at first and we were sardines in a can we moved to our actual seats which were much better honestly id love to see this again so that i can see holly sing what a joke i guess i watch too many dance shows because i was not impressed it was not at all entertaining the dancers were not synchronized with each other their dance moves were very simplistic and it just did not look professional as for holly i now know why she is single not only is she stupid i am basing this off of the girls next door episodes this show shows how talentless she is all she does is stand there and giggle the show is not at all done sensually or sexy it is more like a stupid comedy a more appropriate title would have been opps theres my boobs dont waste your money i would have been more entertained by a high school musical not the movie my husband and i both left after thirty minutes of enduring this pathetic show and walked out laughing because we couldnt believe that we had wasted our money on this we would have been better entertained by burning our money this was an amazing show holly looked great and did a really good job the other women were all beautiful talented and amazing my favorite was mrs peter if you like burlesque then this is a must see show i would definitely go to see it again our seats were so close and amazing best show for bachelorettebachelor parties dont go here if you are shy about nudity because you will see plenty of it my girlfriends and i went to this show because we got free front row tickets my friends cousin carolyn pace was one of the dancers shes the asian one she was awesome by the way too bad she isnt there anymore i was very surprised about the content sometimes i felt like i was in a strip club and other times i felt like i was in a comedy show they had a variety of different musical acts and they got the audience involved as well my only problem with this show is with holly madison this girl barely does anything her name is the reason why people go but shes doesnt really do anything except stand around dancing and singing are not her specialties i think they only hired her to put a famous face in the show i wont give away a lot but the story revolves around holly madisons dreams a dream sequence gives you plenty of creative ideas for the show i saw a girl on a bear skin rug a girl on a horse and of course a girl on a pole both guys and girls would get a kick out of this show because its more entertaining than a strip club plus you get a lot eye candy guys will thoroughly enjoy it im sure girls dont go if youre a prude you wont enjoy it we got a great deal for our seats i went to holly madisons website and theres a link to get the tickets discounted we got ours for off but i just checked the website and now it looks like its only off we sat at row i and the seats were right in the middle of the stage and we were probably only about less than feet away from the stage we got to see everything really up close i think holly madison is suppose to sing a song but she didnt sing that night because she had lost her voice i would have liked to see that performance from her the other singers were great lets face it im a saucy girl who loves getting dirty with the ta who cares about the story line i get to see hollys cellulite thank god shes normal sexy wet man bodies and omg the swing i had to excuse myself during that one hott at times i had to compare my tatas to theirs and overall felt like i had two perks up on them this show is definitely not for the timid my two girlfriends and i were the obnoxious girls screaming at the top of our lungs while our other two slightly more conservative friends were hiding their faces away from us lmao after reminiscing from this show i think i need to excuse myself again my wife and i bought vip seating tickets for her brother and fiance as birthday gifts we were both scepticle about peepshow based on previous reviews we were so wrong we purchased bottle service for twice we seemed to be the only table odering table service come on its vegas and bottle service for plus tip is cheap i could not believe how cheap the other vip tables were being the highlight of the show was that our table was singled out could it have been because of the bottle service and my bro in law was taken on stage and holly fondled my hair as she walk blindfolded off the front of the stage the definate highlight part of the show was josh singing pony great voice and the female pole dancer she has some serious skills and knows how to work that pole we got hollys attention and got her to look over and smile and wave at our table with just a little bit of yelling and screaming it works try it get vip seating its worth it every show we see in vegas we attemp to get vip seating why not its vegas the only downfall was of the guys from the audience one being my bro in law another guy and the last was timber who made it prety obvious that he was part of the show even after or i lost count screwdrivers it was pretty obvious holly is beautiful and i can definately tell the difference between her and the other girls in her show and a few other topless shows in vegas zumanity being one grade a choice thats why good ol heff chose her i am really glad that we bought our tickets at one of the discount ticket places because this is the worst show we have ever seen in las vegas even with the reduced prices we still felt grossly overcharged for this hour wreck holly madison does not do much during the show just walks around and attempts singing and dancing for a few minutes despite the fact that she has been doing this show for a while now she still looks awkward and stiff whether or not she is chubby as others have said doesnt matter to me what does matter is that she cannot perform at all the rest of the dancers are not exactly synchronized and their routines are nothing special the singing is pretty good but after a while this show just drags yes you get to see boobies but it was boobies for boobies sake the storyline makes no real sense the highlights of the show were timber and the pole dancer in green i wont say more for those who are still going to see the show ultimately i think that for the price one can see a better show i recommend zumanity p s the ushers can be real jerks dont you dare even glance at your phone before the show or think that you can sneak in even a piece of candy how on earth is this show still on i went two years ago with friends it was terrible why oh why do people pay for this you will get far better value for your money by placing it all on black love holly holly gets stars she also actually got naked which surprised me if you have a bachelor party vip seats are way worth it holly i believe is the only reason why this show has lasted not impressive especially for vegas standards and ill say why but hopefully without giving the show away one of the dancers couldnt even do a whole split a good part of the choreography was just a lot of girls walking around topless on stage and if that was what i was after i could just go to a strip club and i bet those girls actually know what to do with a stripper pole which brings me to my next point i actually got excited when i saw the stripper poles but sadly only one girl really did anything with it and she was not very talented she didnt or couldnt even climb the pole herself she needed a boost up i have taken pole classes at s factors and everything she did i could have done also i really thought there would be more of a storyline it was kind of all over the place hollys friend justin got parts in the show which made the girl audience go wild he was a very talent singer and i would say better then the girl lead i really expected to see angel after seeing justin p this show was cool but not for plus its more like a show but like i said if you have a bachelor party its optional but i would probably get buzzed first as it is less likely for you to be disappointed then the show will probably be worth it there are definitely plenty of beautiful young girls getting topless there were also super strict about you using your phone and this was the only show i saw in vegas that had to look in my purse and told me to turn off my phone the show was amazing so glad i went the dancers were hot the singing was awesome the skits were great especially the guy who sang had a beautiful voice killed the song pony the show was funny and entertaining was a little sad that holly madison didnt do much during her own show except for a few singing and dance moves but still stood out as the best and not because she was topless something about her highlights is that the theater is small so no matter how far you sit you still feel like your a few feet away read some bad reviews but def disagree go watch and see for yourself awful dont waste your time and money on this burlesque rip off ive seen burlesque and cabaret shows before and typically there is some talent and humor involved although a couple of the dancers were somewhat talented peep show was not funny it was depressing and pathetic and hard to watch seriously people just say no attended the show today and loved it i went there before reading any reviews to be surprised holly as the main headliner doesnt do the majority of dancing singing but reels the audience in with some charismatic performances the rest of dancers were superb with original music amazing singing and magnetizing choreography their numbers were all very entertaining and not raunchy even with alot of boob show its a burlesque type of show what do people expect i liked that the majority of the performers were a la natural except for a few of the girls that had obvious voluptuous chest like holly we got the tickets a few months in advance and got a great deal to up grade to vip seating where the girls were a few feet from us we had to turn a few times around as the girls are all over the stage one of the best performances for me was the dancer working the pole thats some upper body strength and made it look so incredibly effortlessly loved the show holly is so gorgeous lots of ta and beautiful bodies the whole show is a stimulation to the eyes the show is a sultry spin off to the stories of mother goose great dancing and the singers were good too the would be awesome for a bachelors or a few couples us that want to see some burlesque fun for new years i persuaded the hubbie to go to peepshow with me i have been a holly fan since girls next door and was way excited i got a discount on free upgraded tickets from a third party website for about each with all fees the seats were amazing rd row dead center if purchasing tickets keep this in mind the banquets are as far down in vip as i would want to be there were vip tables and i noticed so many had to crane their necks to see other partssides of the stage there are walkways so regardless of where you sit behind vip you have a pretty decent seat now for the show it was upbeat entertaining and definitely worth the price some reviews mention holly is not in it much but there are more than a handful of scene worthy and topless albeit for fellow holly fans my unexpected favorite was josh strickland his voice gave me chills cheaza and quite a few of the other girls were great some were just ok the brunette who the holds he bear and sings on the floor was not a favorite nor was little red riding hood visit the peepshop afterwards for fun holly merchandise p s head to the heart bar after peep show some of the dancers from peepshow hang out there and are total sweethearts this was a very good vegas show i went into this show blindly my friend got me and my gf free tickets so we figured why not it turned out to be an excellent show we were sitting in the nd row from the tables in front excellent seats the show is based on fairy tales with a twist all of the women are beautiful and the dancing and stunts are good it is mostly a topless show there were several couples that were there together mostly middle aged couples probably looking to have a good time this is really a great show i wouldve paid to see it and i would see it again this was a fabulous show the costumes set storyline music and dancers were all great emcee is amazing and charismatic you will be amazed how gracefully these dancers glide through their stunts and i call them stunts because dance routines make it sound easy holly has a minor role but does kill it in teddy bear song and there is no doubt all of these girls have to be in shape loved the costumes and the storyline too wasnt impressed with josh while many people write about him and his wonderful singing talent my boyfriend and i thought he sounded like christina aguilera yes a girl we bought our tickets that morning at the half price ticket place and were pleased with our seats which were in the back of the first tier i wouldnt want to sit too close because you will miss all the acrobatics and aerial dances definitely worth it despite buying the tickets from a discount ticket booth i felt robbed and want hours of my life back this was a dollar show at best other than having a rocking body holly has no talent couldnt sing or dance nothing the storyline made about as much sense as any porno not anything coherent singers were good but again they were singing about fairy tales literally little miss muffet bo peep and the big bad wolf the one saving grace was when they pulled people from the audience to the stage there was some good comedy value there the show dragged on and on i literally fell asleep someone suggested zumanity as an alternative to this dont bother i fell asleep there as well if you are a woman this may have a little more appeal not sure why but my wife enjoyed it i was somewhat disappointed in the show childrens fairytales and burlesque dont quite make the mix you dont see much of holly bought middle tickets in the last minute and they gave us a free upgrade with seats close to the stage expect a lot dancing and lots of singing i didnt know this was a topless show so once the tops came off the guys in the audience were cheering loudly and up only loved loved this sexy strip tease show from holly madison we had vip seats at table right under the main stage we got to see everything so closed up some of the dancers even talked to us a hot girl used our bottle water to splash on her chest so sexy drinks are around each and they are strong they have specialty peep show cocktails too i had peeptini so yummy i liked it a lot that most of dancers have natural boobs and their dancer bodies are just sooo hot and some male dancers did some strip tease too all performers were very energetic and professional they brought some hot guy from the audience he actually was one of the dancers too but he acted so good they had so many themed performances costumes very creative this show started with a short film of holly she performed about only minutes in the entire show most of the time she just stood there and acted sexy but she did went topless stripped down to just a sexy g string so i was ok with her performance i like her a lot she is so pretty overall i loved this show very entertaining and sexy loved those hot natural dancer bodies plus hollys hotness amazing all the staffs were very friendly and helpful perfect for a sexy yet romantic date night entertainment it adds a little bit spice to your vegas trip for sure ps no cameras and phones are allowed in the theatre very strict have to turn off phones as soon as you enter the theatre what a snooze fest i actually got a deal on expedia and ended up paying about per person for vip front row seats and i was quite disappointed i love holly madison from the days she was on the girls next door to her own reality show she makes a very entertaining realty star but i cant say she can act sing or dance the story line was alright playing into different childhood tales but it wasnt engaging i literally felt like i was at a strippers club with live singers it wasnt a stage performance it was plain and simple stripping i went with my boyfriend on we had bought tickets online in advance vip table we were pissed to find out that you have to wait in line with the people that are buying last minute tickets because they have no will call booth we really liked peepshow it kept us entertained the whole show we were really close to the stage right next to one of the runway things i really recommend a vip table holly didnt have a huge part but she showed her boobs so my boyfriend was happy lol holly is like a barbie type i know other people were saying she needs to hit the gym but i think her body was hot she would look wird all toned stuff shes just not that type most of the dancers were extremely talented and the lead singer was hilarous it was a fun show the drinks are quite expensive they take forever to get we were halfway through the show before our first one arrived they were pretty strong drinks though the waitress we had told us our total so we paid then she came back saying we owed more money interupted the show again so we thought that was pretty unprofessional all in all it was a good show we thought it was worth the money but we love holly first of all the usher was really rude the show does not start till pm and one of the usher kept harassing me at pm to turn off my cell phone when i aw trying to figure out how to turning it off there is really no point on that because this is the adult show topless and the simple annoucement will do and they did like all other shows secondly what a horrible show the plot is bad and not to mention holly madison cannot sing act or dance for the entire minutes she shows up minutes top this is absolutely waste of money even though we only paid for price if your intension is to see holly madison topless fake btw you will be enjoying about minutes of that bite at stratosphere is a much better topless show and cheaper than peepshow i would not even give one star and that is how bad it is this was our first show in vegas during our wedding honeymoon week my wife wanted me to book something sexy for our first night in town and after doing alot of research i came up with peepshow neither of us knew who holly madison was but after seeing her up close in this show we both agreed she is hot i ordered vip tickets months in advance so i was pleased to find out we were seated at table front left center they warned us ahead of time we might get splashed and we did by milk and bathwater no biggie it was all good some people suggested sitting back farther to see the whole show but we had no problem being so close a few times during the show we had to turn left or right to see some of the show that moved out onto the catwalks that go into the crowd a few rows but not a problem another nice thing about being so close is we could hear some of the things the performers were saying to each other and us and a few times the girls were practically on our table very nice the show had everything we wanted singing dancing choreography a storyline comedy and most of all hot sexy dancers showing boobies lots of boobies my wife thought the guys in the show were hot too some people say that holly doesnt really do much in the show but i have to disagree we thought she was the central focus of the show and she was on stage involved in most of the acts ok so she wasnt the lead vocalist or the storyteller still she was the peep in peepshow drinks were expensive as expected i forget how much i spent a nice couple next to us bought us some really strong shots because we were newlyweds the waitress was not a distraction from the show and let us settle our tab when the show was over highly recommended ill admit if i didnt have such a strange fascination with holly madison this would be an easy however she makes it interesting despite her short stage appearance time first things first if you are going solely for holly id advise you to skip this show as she is only in it for a short period of time however she does manage to make her presence worth the admission price alone however i do love burlesque shows and so ill admit this delivered the goods for the most part despite being heavily flawed the highlights are easy holly of course the hilarious peep diva the female singers the special effects and the songs despite being styled like generic radio pap i absolutely despise the milkshake is pretty funny too with the gigantic tub of milk though it had me wondering where they got all that milk from timber was pretty funny as well and them painting him with pink was priceless the downsides two words josh strickland i have no idea who he was originally but his lady voice was so distracting and it took away from the show hearing him slaughter feeling good was depressing suuun in the skaaaaaahhhh yeh know what i meaaaan ugh i have a feeling he was lip singing an auto tuned vocal track i noticed several suspicious robotic shifts in his voice the pink song was utterly lame and unintentionally hilarious too a song about someone being obsessed with pink get real also i think the show has run its course at times it seemed a bit tired like people were going through the motions not that it was bad its just tired if you can get discounted or preferably free tickets do go but otherwise skip this and see zumanity much superior show instead sigh i really wanted to like this show there were aspects of it that i did like but i didnt leave thinking wow that was so good or that was worth the and i didnt even pay the first part of the show all you see is hollys back but no worries her boobies will come out later overall i really liked the green pole dancer the chosen guy was really awkward cute nn most of the girls surprisingly had real boobs ive never seen so many boobies in my life i suggest just waiting for discount tickets the night of or before the show we watched it christmas weekend and the row in front of us was completely empty first time ive ever been to a burlesque type show in vegas i actually liked it i wasnt expecting anything much we actually thought it was just a strip tease and no show well lets start from the beginning aubrey o day does have some singing chops but wow has she let herself go so the whole idea is its a burlesque show with a storyline yes you get to see naked women the songs were contemporary and there were a few guys in the show so its not just for men its definitely geared for both sexes i did enjoy it and would see it again on our first trip to vegas my wife and i were celebrating our year anniversary we had already purchased tickets to o it was a great show but i really wanted to see something a little more adult in nature my wife wasnt really up for it but after hearing a few couples say that they enjoyed the show she said she would go we happened to be there when holly was on vacation and angel was in her place this didnt bother me because i think angel is very attractive and did a great job the show was not that full maybe because of holly missing or that it was a sunday you wouldnt have known it though the cast did a great job there are plenty of topless scenes and a few pretty good stripingtease scenes there was interaction with the audience and they really tried to keep everyone into it some of the singing wasnt that amazing but the dancing and acting was right on par for this type of show if you are wanting to see a provocative show as a couple but not feel too dirty after seeing it this is a good one to go see this is the first show ive seen in vegas im a fan of holly madison from watching her on the girls next door im happy to see that she is doing well for herself and having fun the story costumes are fun and there is a lot of creativity in the song and dance im a captive audience member and was surprised by a few of the cool things they did im glad we didnt get the vip table seats and got the nd row instead i dont really like being below the stage and looking up so take that into consideration if youre contemplating vip we bought drink each at the bar before the show and they were tasty something like a washington apple with sour apple pucker cranberry this was a fun outing for a double date and i enjoyed it i also think it would be fun to do in a group of ladies during a bachelorette weekend do i feel the need to see it again no probably not its a one done thing that i can say ive done vegas trip do not go to this show with any expectations for anything other than topless women and acrobatics the women are beautiful and capable of amazing flexibility lets just say that on the other hand the humor is raunchy which they warned us about and not a bit funny which they didnt the attempt at a story line is a shambles it involves odd and unclear connections to some randomly selected childrens fairy tales the music appeared to be pre recorded since no musicians were visible or acknowledged and im not entirely sure the vocals werent pre recorded either and heres the part that finally killed it for me the lead actress not holly ended the show by literally demanding that everyone in the audience rise up and give the cast a standing ovation never before in my entire theater going life have any performers ended any show by asking the audience to give them a standing ovation how pathetic as far as holly madison her role isnt minimal and shes onstage a fair amount but it is very tightly scripted and controlled with none of the spontaneity that we all loved about her in the girls next door a little audience interaction or qa would have gone a long way and whoever decided not to trust her to just be herself for at least some small part of this production is a fool in fairness a lot of people seemed to enjoy the show but the couple in front of us walked out before it was over and we were tempted to join them i have been to many shows and of all of them this is my least favorite there isnt very much talent and no clear storyline if you are a guy and want to see naked chicks i would suggest zumanity because you get that plus talent my friends who came with me had never been to a show in vegas and they werent very impressed either i would honestly choose this show as a last resort we actually did because everything else was sold out this is my first show ever in vegas and im soooo glad i went im a huge fan of holly madison from the girls next door and seeing her performance in person was amazing she played the role really well and very cutesy well as cute as you can be topless the show is much more than a strip tease burlesque show theres singing and a story line to every performer the singers were amazing btw josh from hollys world love my favorite was the green dancer i cant remember her name and theres also male dancers audience interaction so its definitely not a males only type show i highhlyy recommend checking this show out p s if you dont want to pay full price because you a dont think its worth it b on a budget or c would rather save money for alchyyy i recommend buying the tickets at the tixtonight booths we got our amazing seats for just compared to the usual something something full price cool show for men or women holly madison ass is wonderful make sure you get a front row seat all the girls are beautiful most of them have natural breast and the music and dancing is good come early and grab a bite t eat at the strip bar next door fun show to check out either with your friends or with your wife or with whoever holly madison is most of the show and does a great job by the way your better off giving your money away to the street performers the lack of imagination creativity and talent mostly on hollys part is very palpable or it might be that i just have been spoiled rotten by all the great shows that ive seen here in vegas in all years that ive been coming here what threw me off the most was what happend to an audience member next when she made the mistake of snapping a shot dont you dare take a picture because the gestapo will come and hunt you down specially if during the middle of the show holly and her sidekick stop the show to announce that someone took a picture and they need to go get them i was sadden appalled and embarrassed for the lady that got almost dragged out of her chair to be confronted by by the gestapo securityushers that they have after witnessing what was going on for minutes and sitting down on a half empty auditorium i couldnt get over the fact that someone could get treated this way in front of the audience i understand that there is regulations but to humiliate someone that is paying your salary is not the way to handle this kind of situations i couldnt wait for the show to be over pulled out my cell phone to check what time it was and guess what occurred next i was confronted by one of there gestapo security guardsushers and was forced to turn off my cell phone immediately after that occurred i had no choice but to leave because because of personalbusiness matters my cell phone needs to be on at all times i have seen about shows and have never witness such a lack of respect for another human being hollyside kick you guys still have a long way to go and dont deserve to be a demanding bs im sorry to break it to you but you are not anywhere near an icon status if i could give this negative stars i would i was a huge fan of holly madison and dragged my friends to see this because i just knew it would be great wrong holly has no talent and she looked awkward and uncomfortable the whole time there was zero story line and i just started laughing halfway through because it was so terrible we got these tickets for free that should have been our first clue and i still felt like i got robbed also we went on a saturday night in the middle of spring break and the theater was full im serious i think that says a lot just dont waste your money your time or your dignity go see o instead i was a huge fan of holly before this and i left feeling like i got punched in the face by the harsh reality that reality stars have no talent who would have known terrible i just saw this one let me start off by saying i am never one to obsess over celebrities and never really paid any attention to holly madison nor did i know much about her except she has a past with playboy after seeing this show i have no idea how she has her own show in vegas to be honest with you she doesnt do or say much the first minutes of the show and just kind of stands around if this was her first show it would have been more understandable but she cannot act looks awkward on stage and more importantly has absolutely no stage presence this next next part may be harsh but i am coming more from who she is surrounded by on stage so keep that in mind the girl needs to lose weight yes it may sound harsh however when you are the star of the show topless several times and surrounded by women that are in great shape it just doesnt seem right in addition the male dancer the wolf was questionable at best for having a main part in a big show in the strip i just thought they could have casted a guy that was in better shape and find a better dancer lets be honest thats not that hard to find there were some good parts to the show and overall i would say the show is entertaining i didnt walk out disappointed or sad that i wasted money on the show but i would have been upset if i paid full price for tickets the show isnt very creative at all i wouldnt pay full price for tickets just buy them from the discount ticket booths on the strip we sat in the section right behind the vip section and the seats were great the theater isnt that big so there are many really good seats theres only so many ways you can show someone taking off their clothes the unifying theme is weak at best and holly madison is pretty terrible the girls are all beautiful and talented dancers but over all the show just isnt fun if you are looking for an adult show that is worth your time and money see zumanity the show was ok we had a good time but for the price it could of been way better holly probably comes out times max like minutes maybe less my husband loved it because you get to see a lot of skin i liked the show very much i agree with others who say that holly madison was a disappointment but the show was very good i enjoyed the singers and dancers very much what a lame show holly has no talent no acting no dancing other than a beautiful body and she doesnt have to say much so thats almost a bonus the supporting singers and dancers did a great job and would have been better off without her i got about minutes of laughs out of the show but had to fight falling asleep for the rest of it there must be better shows in las vegas to spend your money on as a huge girls next door fan i dont regret going to this show or to spending top dollar to get seats so close that i could have reached out and touched holly had i wanted to get tossed out of the show but the show itself was just okay holly isnt that talented and thus really doesnt have a huge roll in the show the other performers are very talented but i didnt love the show only the experience of seeing the celebrity if youre a holly fan i would recommend seeing it but only if youre willing to spend the money to be close enough to really see her my rating is average because i believe this show is just average it is just dancing singing a little audience interaction but mostly nothin too special about h madison the real credit goes to the back up singers the diva dj of the house and the male singer man can they sing i was a little tired going into this show and coming off ka which is impressive by the way but i take each show with a fresh perspective and this show was just well not worth the money maybe for a head instead of or or i mean anyone can see girls dancing topless to music and colorful lights but over all it was nothing special h madison barely doesnt do anything i think she is just there to sell her name to the show no offense she is freaking gorgeous dp seriously all the dancers get stars holly gets star as she clearly looked awkward smiled phoney did not display any warmth at all to the audience she got this multi million contract just for looking pretty sleeping with hef who gave her a name i loved girls next door holly expected more from her even her headlights looked weird as they point sideways where as the dancers were beautiful real the lead singers were all good so other than bringing her name i dont think peep show will miss holly meh maybe i was tired maybe i was hungover or maybe the show just didnt live up to expectations expected to see more of holly throughout the show but i agree with the other reviewers the cast was the star of this show and holly was the proverbial cherry on the top worst vegas show ive ever seen i went with a girlfriend for her bachelorette party last year some time and it was by far the lamest vegas show ive ever been to i like peep shows just as much as the next person but this one was awful vegas topless shows are usually very entertaining and attention holding for the cost this show is definitely not worth it tickets are overpriced because holly is in the show and quite frankly her topless is nothing i need to pay to see i have the internet most of the other girls in the show have real breasts you know the kind that move with them which is a positive i believe that the premise of the show was good and could have been done more artfully and tastefully than the current version i think the show has entertaining potential that said the lines were terrible the only redeeming part of the show was i think little green riding hood i dont know but she was the best performer she did a number on pole and was relatively talented the music and singing were terrible at best the dancers were not synchronized a huge waste of a night in vegas great show good music and they have some amazing looking performers i got upgraded to seats closer to the stage so i have a nice view and i had a very fun time i am a huge holly madison fan and would definitely see it again my husband and i was in the vip seating and loved it this show is for both men and women you will all enjoy it there are so many beautiful women to watch and men too that have great talent then dont forget holly madison she sang a song and she was great they all did a great job looked like they were having fun and it was very entertaining this is by far my favorite vegas show it was cute enjoyed the show holly is beautiful super entertaining and a really fun and funny show we sat in the front row right behind vip and it was great i loved the costumes and the humor in the show really made it worth it i came here with the wife we found a deal to get the tickets for pretty cheap so it seemed like a good idea the theater was not too full we had an empty seat to on both sides of us and right in front which was great to have the extra leg and arm space we sat in the back section the crowd was pretty much made up of couples like ourselves the show itself was pretty good i can only compare it to zumanity when it comes to topless shows and i enjoyed this much more better storyline not crude and i enjoyed the music there were some slow parts here and there but overall not a bad show its holly madison if you are already a fan as i am it is an entertaining show she is not known for her singing or acting ability so watch something else if thats what you want josh is amazing the dancers and other singers are talented its a cheeky show enjoy i really wanted to like this show ive been watching holly since her girls next door days and was excited to see what her life had become in vegas the show isnt actually all bad it has its funny moments however few there may be but overall its borderline cheesy yes the girls are topless but its all cheesy yes i said it again remakes of common songs with average choreography and starring holly madison is false advertisement yeah shes there shes suppose to be a main character but she doesnt really do too much i dont regret going especially since we got discounted tickets off of travelzoo but i dont think i would recommend it seeing hollys last show is dec th i had to see it this past trip to vegas i can see where other reviewers say that holly has no real talent but i think that part is played up even more in the shows story line she comes off innocently sweet and sexy josh is wow amazing the host was great and dancers are sexy enjoyed the show we had second row seats so we got to see everything up close and personal maybe too close my friend was shocked at how holly looks from a few feet away and was convinced that it wasnt her for awhile the singing and dancing of her fellow performers is impressive this show is fun if youre drinking but i would never pay full price for it great entertainment for men and women loved the dancing singing and sexy ppl will go back again we hadnt planned on attending this show but picked up one of the mini vegas magazines from the backseat of a vegas cab and found a for ticket coupon where we went online and got to pick our own seats you can also get this deal at the half price ticket booths along the strip although using them wont allow you to pick your own seats as for seating the most expensive seats are at the very front and are tables with drink service i dont recommend these because most of the time people sitting there had to turn their heads backwards to see the girls dancing behind them because the stage extends outwards in the middle and sides when looking at a map of seating to pick your seats behind the tables is a big chunk of seats with middle left and right section these are the best and are where everyone was sitting we were dead center of the middle section rd row and could see everything perfectly right and left sections also offered a great view behind this chunk of seats is another chunk further back but only about people were sitting there and right above that chunk is a balcony which was empty my husband and i were pleasantly surprised at how entertaining the show was having seen and hated mgms crazy horse i can see peepshow was much better and sexier the dancers are in fantastic shape and are all natural excluding holly of course the theater had really great sound and the dance numbers were cool the singers were also very talented unfortunately i have to say holly was the worst part of the show shes not the star but appears occasionally to act dance sing and show her breasts sadly she doesnt excel at any of these except baring her breasts in fact whenever she appeared the show seemed to slow and get a bit boring this may be why her last show is in december the show even had some really funny moments at the beginning of the show they tell you there is even eye candy for the ladies but this couldnt be further from the truth there are only two guys and they are short and not as toned as the women dont expect thunder from down under type of men overall the show wasnt superb holly was a letdown and the women could work harder on being more synchronized with their group dancing but we enjoyed it and i would recommend it if you are looking for an adult show plus for tickets makes it an even better deal this show is so bizarre it tried to have a storyline which didnt make any sense and at points was completely laughable the dancing was like a high school cheerleader routine some of the dancers were amazing the pole dancer hands down was the best part the person from the audience was hilarious but majorly disappointing when he turned out to be part of the show too this show was a solid stars id recommend seeing this for the price we did we found tickets on travelzoo for half off which was awesome since tickets were normally typical for vegas what to expect lots of topless women of all body types duh its called peepshow not offensive at all though dancing singing story telling the whole thing is based around fairy tales some highlights funny this show included some comedy which had my group laughing hard holly she is good but not in the show as much as i would have expectedliked dancing there was lots of dancing which was entertaining ticket price on travelzoo hurry and see this if you want to catch holly shes probably not going to be there much longer my group noticed that she had a little belly on her when we were there and then days later it came out she was preggo pretty funny this is a show to see one time but probably not necessary to check out again peepshow was definitely an entertaining experience it was worth the discounted price we paid for tickets but i doubt i would venture to go see it a second time singing and dancing kept me entertained there is a fair amount of topless women but it is a peepshow and this is vegas it was tastefully done and i didnt find it very distracting the show had its moments of humor but could have showcased a little more of holly id say its definitely worth seeing especially if you can find cheap tickets and are in the mood for a fun very vegasesque type of show we were in vegas recently welcoming a nephew to his st bday and what better way to celebrate than a vegas show we scored cheap seats to peepshow and from the reviews we read in the local rag x it was supposed to be great so off we went the show is actually quite good great stage great story great story teller and some truly amazing athletic stunts the guys all appreciated the lack of clothing on the women and the girls got to see their share of backsides if i stopped here id give this a five star it really was a good show as far as vegas shows go but i cant stop i have to give one warning if you ever want to see the poster girl for dumb vacuous blonde with zero stage presence but granted nice boobs google holly madison my god she cant act her way out of a paper bag her few lines thank god sound like shes reading a cue card which i suspect is hidden somewhere on stage and she has a deer in the headlights look the entire time she has any stage time which thankfully was minimized its like the movie showgirls was real or something what was hugh thinking oh hes a guy nevermind for whatever reason shes billed as the headline she could go away and this show would go way up in quality seriously i enjoyed this show found it really creative and entertaining the modern sexay fairy tale theme was fun and also made for great costumes hollys role was during the slow parts and she basically just sweetly innocently glided around the stage barely saying anything throughout the show she left a lot more to be desired but she still succeeded in somewhat tying the show together with her presence and pretty face the dancers were hot and really good at doing whatever they were doing my favorite parts were the pole dance and the flying pony and the milk tank was silly interesting the peepshow diva was hilarious and brought a lot of energy and a great storyline to the show i really enjoyed the music a fast paced mix of classics modern hip hop always with a creative twist in the beatsvocals the male singer was fierce and he probably half made the show his voice caught us off guard in the beginning but by the middle i was entranced by his passionate melodies sat in front row very entertaining holly madison should just be a guest star if anything she doesnt dance flashes her breast like once so u can see her plastic surgery scars but the rest of the cast was great the singing was good man some of those dances got me kinda hot exlady with pumpkin n stripper poleshorse lady ughh gotta appreciate all size of boobies and booties i saw in the show it flowed well and kept me interested show was about mins long saw the show in vegas saturday and dear holly im going to need your extremely pregnant behind to sit the hell down somewhere off a stage please and thanks there is something gross and extremely unsexy about watching a visibly pregnant woman in lingerie waltz around a stage at a burlesque show just ewwww factor for me minus that the show was amazing and honestly the only star you see missing is for the very distracting mediocre performance holly madison gave while annoyingly and distractingly trying to cover her baby bump during the entire show other than that i loved every minute of the show and would come see it again once hollys replaced the ladies are crazy talented and they incorporate males into the show nicely ive seen several shows in vegas and this is hands down one of my favorite very tastefully done the two background singers were just okay but i loved the high energy and fun environment the peep diva who hosted was funny with lots of energy the brick house dancer red and the pumpkin pole dance along with the male act timber were my favorites the milk shake act was pretty good and super creative although the girl that sang during this act wasnt too good def worth seeing the show and its in planet hollywood which is a hotel that i love great vibe good food and live clubs wow i can see these new reviews are harsh my fiancee and i went to peepshow in august on his bday i bought the tickets and the meet n greet as a surprise for his th he is a huge holly fan and every summer in vegas we see her pics all over and somehow we never go well this year was different i heard holly was leaving the show in dec this was before she announced her pregnancy and i had to get tickets for my fiancee before hollys run ended the show was great way better than i had expected it to be i bought the cheapest seats there was a for deal and the theater is teeny and we were in the first rows center holly was right in front of my fiancee the whole time and she was completely topless most of the show which i was surprised by dancing talking topless by these other reviews i guess things have changed now that shes pregnant i expected her to just flash here n there but nope her top was off alot as was most of the cast josh strickland was also amazing he is such a talent and should be on broadway singing the show was very cute and we enjoyed it the best part for my fiancee is when everyone filed out of our section to leave and i made him stay seated he asked me why we werent leaving and just then an usher came over to ask to see our meet n greet tickets my fiancee almost died he was like what we are gonna meet her it was priceless in years of dating i have never seen my fiancee speechless and nervous as hell he wasnt that nervous the day before when he proposed to me the ushers take you to a section of the auditorium and give you a glass of champagne holly comes out like minutes later in her t shirt and sweats and poses with each person and each couple and chats a few minutes she was so sweet and nice and even wrote happy birthday on my fiancees autographed picture when we mentioned this was his birthday present then you exit and wait for your pics to be ready it was a great experience and i am so glad we didnt miss out as shes only got show nights left thank you holly for a once in a lifetime experience oxxoxoxox i saw the version with angel porrino and the singing and dancing numbers were great unlike the holly madison version however she does go topless the dancing numbers were really fun and surely the star of this show has little more than vignette appearances the acts are meant to represent fairytales but they are really only loosely tied to any stories the dancers are absolutely amazing and do an incredible job i really liked all of the song and dance numbers the girls were really talented the women singing were also very very talented my complaints nudity felt anti climactic and tacked on it almost felt unnecessary and at some points almost weird and often rushed during one of the final acts in the middle of singing the lead girl just sort of takes off her top no one else does and its not as if there is something leading up to it or even a change in the music or anything it seemed weird and unnecessary mid show they pull three men out of the audience and do an awesome number with one of them later on it turns out he was part of the show all along he does a whole number that felt a bit disappointing because everything that happened was only funny because you thought he was just some random guy overall it was a pretty good show the tickets are less expensive than a lot of other shows in vegas and i certainly wasnt disappointed i loved this show i have been wanting to watch this show ever since hollys world i was disappointed that i didnt catch holly madison but instead it was angel porrinowho was also on hollysworld i did not want to wtach coco who will be the star in december they should just keep angel but anyways i loved it love angel as bo peep the cast were so talented love their singing and dancing i did not know they would show some nudity but i was fine with it josh the head singer was a great singer cant wait to watch it again but i want to watch with angel not coco oh and for the tickets we got a for deal not bad at all i have seen every single performer who has fronted this show from really good to really bad but last night with coco was the best mel b was awesome way back in the day when the show opened but what do you expect with people who can sing dance holly madison was absolutely horrible might as well have taped a spot on the stage for her to stand because she had no idea what was going on sister looked like she was lost angel porrino what a doll way better as in more enthusiastic about the minutes on stage than holly was and way better to look at too i hope we continue to see her around vegas for awhile coco last night owned it thank god they put someone in the show again who could dance shake that big booty girl i hope eventually they change more of the show they changed it a little between holly coco so we have more coco dancing i agree with the last reviewer coco is the best i have seen yet man o man she can dance act is freakin hilarious and has one of the hottest bodies i have seen on stage ever and in contrary to holly this version with coco is extremely topless in the beginning and pretty much throughout the whole finale so glad they finally got a star that is a real vegas headliner we did the vip option and coco actually talked to us for a while after the show unlike holly who just gave us an autograph and pushed us on our way after secs big fan of all the supportings everyone was funny fantastic singers and the dance sets and numbers were on fire very sexy and entertaining show you can tell coco is a dancer cause man she has the moves i wanna see her on dancing with the stars next smokin hot show i went to see peep show on dec thurs night and it was a smokin hot show with coco and company i had been a big fan of holly madison from the girls next door and was happy to hear she was pregnant but sad that she was no headlining the show after reading the previous reviews i was surprised that she had a minor role and didnt even strip for peep show even though in the playboy mansion she could hardly keep her clothes on to call coco aka mrs ice t a replacement is a huge understatement the minute she stepped onto the stage until the final curtain call she had the whole audience howling and cheering for more coco she left nothing to the imagination she has such a voluptuous and sexy figure all the dancers especially the sultry ms pete were incredible the show was super fun and sexy the choreography was mesmerizing with great comedy i would definitely recommend this show better than i thought it would be stars to be exact got hooked up with tickets and thought it would be a th rate crazy horse paris it was a lot more than that i was gladly surprised at the production choreography music and even the talent on stage i wouldve preferred to see either holly madison or angel porrino but coco did just fine not gonna lie nudity certainly helped i overheard one repeat audience member say coco was better than holly and seemed more natural where holly was a more my foot goes here and the other one goes there performer its not like shes on stage the whole show maybe but i guess having someone on the e channel everyday helps move tickets for those considering buying the vip table seats save your money and just get orchestra if youre in the front of vip youll find yourself turning around to see the performers often as there are sections of the stage that come out giving the optimal view for people paying less than you did coco is great i must admit i am a closeted fan of ice loves coco so i was super excited to see her perform i went with my boyfriend and we had tons of fun we were laughing the entire time the guy who serves as the musical narrator has an excellent voice and i was in awe of the dancers skills and super toned bodies if you go in expecting a kinda cheesy burlesque show you wont be dissaponted its super fun and light hearted just dont go in expecting a tony award worthy performance after living in vegas and now going back every year to see my parents this is really the first burlesque type vegas show i do need to mention we had free tickets so my review may be reflected by this the tickets we had for a pm show on a saturday night the seats were really good were were about rows back from the stage and in the center right behind the reserved tables i always wanted to see this while holly was in it but at least we got to go and see coco my wife watched her show on e and it was not all that bad coco really didnt dace that much until the end and she really didnt even talk that much either her entrance to the show was cool and she did take her top off during the end transformation but other than that there was not much of her the rest of the show was filled with vegas show girls and guys who can sing and dance some of the dances were cool i guess i was just expecting more for some reason since i didnt see holly do all this i would assume she would do about the same as coco based on some of the reviews it was a good show but not great the beers were about an they gave you the large beer cans if you are drinking you may want to head to the restrooms a tad before the show ends you can tell in order to beat the mad rush out the doors and o the restrooms right outside the venue area the sad part was that after i waited for my wife to exit the restrooms and we headed over to the peepshow gift shop and as we were about to walk in they were closing down the shop for the night i mean you would at least think they would wait until everyone has exited the entry way of the venue not so much my wife really liked the show because of coco and i thought it was just ok i probably would not go again unless we get more free tickets just want to be honest peepshow was worth every penny paid i ordered the tickets online and scouted out a discount code we were about the th row in the center of the orchestra section i highly recommend trying to get seats there the vip is not where its at with this show since the center runway comes out and a lot of the vip only could see the backs of the performers amazing production quality and pretty ladies even some men for the ladies the only thing i will say is disliked was the star being coco my god the plastic surgery on her they dont even move anymore luckily the show is really about the other girls and coco is more of a prop to keep the rest of the story moving got free tickets didnt like it been to peepshow a year ago when the star was holly madison but seems that except for coco substituting holly show still has the same cast so decided to post a short review even based on last year experiences as advertised if not to count zumanity the only adult revue that is almost a major production show given inexpensive tickets definitely deserves a visit the performers are very talented except for holly cannot comment on coco and skillful could have been cuter but what to do at this level the girls are already cast based on skills not just looks i also liked that the individual numbers were connected into a story something that i think zumanity should do too saw the one with coco the showing showed up late and inebriated out my gord its was ok nothing to really run back for the ending was cool it was more like an erotic fairy tale childish story they do bring you drinks we were in the front row and i got the tickets comped i could complain but who would listen the best was the ending not gonna spoil it but kinda funny look like coco lost some serrious weight for this she didnt have the donky ass like she has on tv and a nice slim waist i said it before ill say it again it was ok its really more for girlswomen like a bachlorette party or something i should have read the yelp reviews before going to this show i was kicked out of the show within mins of the show starting late security insisted i was taking photos when i was not i showed them my photo albums even though its in invasion of privacy and they still refused to let me back in i saw the no photo signs but didnt see any signs for having your phone out i found this to be a poorly organized event im the one paying for a ticket i should be able to look at the time text etc if i need to i found the staff to be rude from the beginning and this has nothing against the actors just to the staff and event company fun sexy in a nutshell my husband and i went to see coco on for the show i was never curious about the show when holly was there and we gotta admit we both loved it i even got some pointers on how to shake it coco the dancers and singers are great coco goes topless twice and does her dance moves real well i would definitely recommend this to friends that want to have some sexy fun i was in vegas last weekend for a bachelortte party with of my friends from college all of us currently live all over the us and are all pretty different and we all yes all ladies loved loved loved this show first coco is beautiful i could not stop looking at her she is so so pretty in person second the bodies on these women are ridiculous definitely inspiration to hit the gym third i could sit and listen to josh strickland sing all day and all night long him and the other main a hilarious lady were a mazing i wish they could sing me to sleep every night their voices are that of a thousand angels seriously love them lastly my cheeks were hurting i was laughing so hard through the show as soon as it was over i wanted to see it again i dont know why this show only has stars becuase i thought it was just fabulous we saw coco in the peepshow and thought it was great we went to the early show and if you really want the best experience go to the private party she has after the late show is over it costs but it was the best money i spent in vegas that weekend coco takes questions from the audience there were about people they have a champagne toast and then she talks to everyone individually takes a couple of pictures with them and then signs her autograph ice t and their dogs were there and they were all very friendly and hospitable ice t is an inspiration to many and is easy to talk to the photos they take are by a professional photographer and then you can access them for free coco signed autographs and photos for me my friends who couldnt make the private party my wife kids very memorable experience you cant use your cameracell phone during the performance for a variety of reasons but this private event was memorable i would be giving this stars if it wasnt for coco or should i say cocos assets good lord the show itself was just ehhhh nothing special but when i got to see coco and her assets out in full display that gained another star in my review like i told my girl on the way out i am forever traumatized in a good way of course we both were not aware of the nudity let alone coco showing off her stuff we had vip table seating and saw her up close and very personal it was my girls bday weekend and she loves her tv show so we went after finding discount show tickets at the casino royale they have a booth where they sell discount vegas show tickets a must visit if your trying to go to any show in vegas we paid for tickets regular price ea in the vip area back to the show kinda bland and could have used more of coco in it i was surprised at how little her participation was i was expecting more of her on stage the show was only about filled on a saturday night so im assuming they are not killing it with tickets sales so keep an eye out for the discounted show tickets honorable mention purchase discount show tickets y pay full retail if you dont have too just saw peepshow this last weekend with my boyfriend and friends i had zero expectations because a friend of mine had seen it when holly was in it and had said that it wasnt that great what i can say is that this show isnt meant to be artistic the shows story line could be a little more clear but i still understood what they were getting at in each number and its still really entertaining the women and men in it are really talented dancers singers etc there is a lot more nudity than i had anticipated but i definitely didnt mind and im sure my boyfriend didnt either coco was adorable and looks fantastic my only complaint is that she wasnt in it enough all in all it was a really good time and i would definitely recommend for anyone to go too we went and saw this show on a tuesday and they had tickets for vip google that stuff we were right next to the stage and this show was great coco is very pretty and the dancing is spectacular the guys in the show do a real good job keeping your interest it is amazing what a pair of tight theighs can do ohh sorry let me talk about the show again lol i would highly recommend it they did make me coat check my popcorn that i had bought in the mall i was hoping one of my guys were picked to go on stage but maybe next time this was tasteful and calssy great couples night out makes you want to be little bo peep we caught the show last night as part of our show smorgasbord here in vega weve done at least one every day i must say i was pleasantly surprised it was entertaining and titalating at the same time think burlesque on adult steroids they did a great job of keeping us entertained with song and dance and the amazing feats of athleticism that were interwoven throughout the show were amazing some of the ladies had six packs that looked air brushed on amazing coco was a nice addition but i really dont know a lot about her i found myself wondering if the show had changed at all since its last star hmm at first i thought she couldnt dance and the others were just dancing around the star but by the end it was evident she had a few moves if her own if you are in vegas and want to catch an adult burlesque type show id recommend this one highly one major bonus is that while the casino allows smoking it is more up to date than many so the smoking was not a pain at all and no smoking in the show and no cell phones or photos boy do they make that clear we all have out dirty little secrets im a fan of ice loves coco so what could get my husband and i to buy tickets to peepshow well of course coco austin in the role of bo peep i have to say we set our expectations low having seen crazy girls at the rivera many years ago but what a surprise wow that cast can dance and sing and take it off in a very entertaining way a mix of burlesque and high energy dance with creative staging as well the show moved quickly for an hour and a half the scene to kelis song my milkshake brings all the boys to the yard was outrageous dancers in schoolgirl clothes reduced to nothing in a giant milk bath where they pressed against the glass in rhythmic unison the male vocal lead was a american idol contestant and had some pipes a gentleman that did an enticing rope dance to woo bo peep was titillating for the ladies the storyline was weak with the bo peep character inter weaved sporadically but its not what you came for right coco did her stuff with panache when it was time and whoa totally las vegas its a great show tastefully done with a sense of humor and a very talented cast fuckin great coco did her thing and we got tix for cheap see it b shes gone my husband and i enjoyed the dance performance and the singing there were a lot of boobs and im glad to see of them looks natural from small to medium size breasts it was a classy burlesque show worth seeing for the price we paid for two people this show was amazing worth every penny and i would do it all over again the theater wasnt huge so i think any seat in the house had a good view i liked the story line and the dancers did an amazing job getting to see coco austin was a bonus i wanted to watch this show from hollys world but i think coco did an amazing job i went to see the show since coco was the main star i went into it thinking it was more of a cute story with a little nudity and i was shocked how much nudity it had i read reviews before i bought tickets but i thought it was much more mellow i have no interest in watching a woman strip down to nearly nothing this was not the show to see if you are a heterosexual woman who doesnt even agree with strip clubs or sexually exploiting women i hated the show and was extremely disappointed that i paid to see this show it is an overpriced strip club dont waste time or money nice show with gorgeous ms coco thats a good las vegas show with show girls and also some jests that provide laughter in the audience the story of the shy diva is unfortunately a little sexist it also does not fit into ms cocos style i liked the show i laughed and had a good time meet holly after the show she was very nice people can be so mean about her but shes just like everryone else shes not a great preformer but she is using her assets to make her living go holly i wish coco had more stage time the dancers and the mc were all great but i came to see coco its a boobie show the guy singer sure had a strong voice like clay aiken strong and there was a fave dancer for every person skinny and tall skinny and short tall and fleshy fleshy and short blonde brunette etc personally i prefer jubilee as a boobie show because of the over the top head dresses and sparkily costumes reminiscent of old vegas i paid out the door for my tickets for seats in the middle back of the theater travelzoo discount was for tickets taxes and fees the vegas coupon book the one w vegas in dressing room lights had a coupon that was discount off regular price fyi other important info headliner in this case coco doesnt really spend nearly enough time on stage funny and sexy show something for everyones taste in scantily clad women discounts are available in local coupon books and will call open most hours so you can pick up your tickets whenever you want practically awesome show i am a coco austin fan and knew this was the one show i wanted to see in vegas no matter what so i bought front row tickets ahead of time tickets were pricy but did get a few bucks off the story line was a bit cheesy but the girls are beautiful especially coco yes its a strip tease show but its high class and enjoyable for but men and women overall i would definitely see it again even though coco is leaving in july peepshow was actually a lot better than i originally expected it to be reviews seem pretty mixed but i was incredibly happy with the show the majority of dancers were great and a couple of them green were absolutely fantastic the singing was also much better than anybody in my group expected and definitely added a lot to the show coco did great and was great to look at although its obvious she is only there to draw in a crowd shes not bad but definitely not as good as the real dancers we bought tickets through tixtonight and were very happy with them we bought the cheapest they had but it really didnt matter the show was far from full and they basically sat everyone in the front sections nobody had bad seats as the entire back half was empty i saw this show with my husband two days ago we thought it was fantastic coco was adorable and seemed to have fun in her role as little bo peep she is a gorgeous woman and a great show girl the music was lively and fun the dancers were talented and we could tell that they worked hard at their jobs this was the first burlesque type show that i have been to and really enjoyed it the music story line and costumes made this show lively and great fun if you are looking for a great show to see in vegas go see this one this show was awesomely bad its not the performers fault they were all decent and its like they know that they are in a terrible show and just trying to hold it together coco is billed as the star but really she has a minor role that is more set decoration than anything the real star is the peep diva who sings and banters with the audience she owns the stage i also liked watching mrs pete who was quite talented on the pole lower production value than you would expect from a show on the strip the worst part is the story its a muddled mess its scenes often have very little to do with each other or with the theme of nursery rhyme characters most are nonsensical i have no idea how this show got produced with such a half assed storyscript it could have been creative and clever but misses the mark in a big way its not even as sexy as it should be its more in your face and obvious we had a bunch of early twenty something frat boys sitting in front of us and they couldnt have been less impressed this show is a lot like the thunder from down under except peephow tries to be serious and fails the only positive is that i laughed a lot i didnt laugh because it was intentionally funny but because it was so terrible this made it somewhat entertaining you know its bad when the cast has to goad the audience into giving them a standing ovation thank goodness we got cheap tickets from tixtonight skip it i just saw this show for the nd time ill start off by saying coco totally blew holly out of the water here she was amazing i loved the show obviously we are not here for the plot the dancers were great and the music was fun and can i just say the girl in the green wow she must work out i think the real star of this show is josh strickland i think i watched him instead of the girls when he was on the stage gorgeous and what a voice just wow i was lucky enough to be able to attend the meet and greet after the show coco is absolutely beautiful in person and so sweet she took her time with each guest i think there were total i never felt like she was rushing to be done w the meet and greet she was awesome i say go see it dont expect a cirque type production but go with an open mind and youll have fun if you are coming here for the current headliner you may be disappointed at her short stage time if however you want a vegas style show this is great while i have not experienced other vegas shows this is much better than some alleged broadway productions if you are here for a good time and dont hang your hat on the headliner you may just enjoy yourself the gymnastic skills choreography music everything was very well done not much plot but you come for the spectacle not the story have fun if youd like a beer for you can get a fire rock pale ale or long board lager not bad great show with beautiful girls girls girls my wife wanted to go we didnt know too much about it besides coco is ice ts partner i enjoyed the show a lot more than my wife of course its weird that you will find more girls in the audience rather than guys tip for married guys this is the best chance to see at las vegas without having a fight with your wife hehe she will enjoy the show also tip buy your tickets in advance i saved on ticket master tip dont forget to pay the meet greet coco is so nice beautiful and she will sign whatever you want fyi that picture of coco and i is real she was not a wax figure the show i am so glad my girls and i watched peepshow for my sisters bachelorette party coco is freakin awesome and i wanted to see that booty in real life lol with the help of heather from base entertainment i was able to book three vip tables literally right next to the stage for girls months in advance the theatre is located inside of planet hollywood so when i arrived i was able to pick up my tickets on a saturday evening right before the show was about to start the doors opened minutes prior to the show so us ladies who are always on time we were the first to be seated the stage and theatre wasnt as big as i imagined it was big but not compared to cirque du soleil the vip tables and chairs were really close to each other and the tables were small which made it difficult since we ordered bottle service imagine a bucket of ice two bottles of alcohol mixers water and popcorn on this tiny table no bueno but somehow it worked after settling in with some cocktails and popcorn the show started i loved it i enjoyed every minute of the show the performersdancerssingers men and woman were amazing since i was so close to the stage i was able to see all the cute lingerie they had on how tone and athletic looking each of the dancers were i loved how everyone on stage interacted with us waving winking and pointing it made us feel special and it would have made you feel special too dont lie there was a lot of singing dancing hair swinging outfit changes boobies and some comedy which made the show so much fun to watch my favorite was the pole dancer and my milkshake brings all the boys to the yard performance the show was featuring holly madison but as a temporary replacement coco austin stepped in although the shows headliner is peepshow starring coco austin coco wasnt on stage as much as i wanted to her to be she made some appearances here and there mostly standing and looking hot but when she was on the stage dancing she rocked it the show ran minutes long with no intermission it went by pretty fast at the end of the show we asked one of the workers to take a picture of the group and they did so without rushing us out or being rude the next show started in minutes so they had to hurry up and clean our server was super nice and was very patient with us all girls walked out very happy we picked peepshow meet and greet again thanks to base entertainment i was able to set up a few meet and greet with the girls and coco my sister the bachelorette is also a huge fan of coco so us girls decided it would be fun to surprise her with a meet and greet the meet and greet takes place after the last show the last show usually ends around midnight so the meet and greet started around am coco came out with her doggies and we were all able to chit chat with her cheers with a champagne toast and take some pictures with her coco is super sweet so down to earth and talked a lot with us all girls had a blast great job peepshow this show was great the women are beautiful and the show itself was amazing we had seats right by the stage and a woman kept picking up her cell phone that was sitting at the table next to us they say times verbally and in print no cell phones so after her second warning she was escorted out i love that they took care of the distraction this made the experience even better i recommend this show to anybody that does not mind topless women and is looking for a smart show very fun show and good laughs lovely ladies and coco look great this was my first burlesque show i took my hubby and we both enjoyed the show coco was staring at bopeep and our seats were great we were spitting distance from ice t coco was above and beyond my expectations i loved josh also his voice was amazing unfortunately peepshow is ending soon so i suggest you seen it asap they are closing in weeks but i thought id send kudos to the shows makeover it was so bad with holly madison but so much better now coco really added what this show needed also they have revamped the flow of the show so it works much better less cheesy and more talent from the main star a good combination i wasnt a huge coco fan from the tv show but she is really something special in person and talented to boot good job catch it before it closes even if you already saw it last year it is better now i promise horrible boring and weird cheesy singing too coco was a bust she seemed dazed and confused fought hard not to fall asleep no wonder its closing soon if you must go make sure you book thru travelzoo for the deal its too bad that the productions last show is tomorrow night but im happy to have caught it prior to its departure i was also extremely excited to see coco austin i took my fiance as an early birthday surprise and we both really enjoyed the show its definitely my favorite show of its genre jubilee ooh la la etc the music was great and i loved that all the singing was live and the singers were really wonderful all the girls looked great and were very athletic we loved the ms pete and all her fancy pole work of course i also enjoyed the gentlemen and their routines ruben not so much haha i loved all the sparkling costumes how tasteful they made topless the skits were tasteful funny exciting and most importantly not cheesy all around great entertainment catch the very last show tomorrow night at there are specials for off or for when you go to their official website or ticketmaster the theater is very intimate so every seat is great i was totally surprised at how good this show was i went in not expecting much but when i left i thought it was a great show had a lot of fun and everyone i was with agreed that the show was really good id give it stars but they kept showing that one guys ass and i wasnt a fan hahaha but all in all a really good show the costumes choreography props all done very well of course youve got to appreciate all the hot bodies and boobs upon boobs of viewing enjoyment i didnt get to see coco but i got to see holly the show was good not raunchy my wife is the one that really wanted to see it and i did not mind at all the production was put together well only thing i didnt like was the seats i wish they were a little softer this is without a doubt the worst show i have ever seen in or out of vegas what a waste of money and we got price tickets the story line is horrible and makes no sense there is no relationship between the signs that are suspended above the stage and what is going on in the story the car has no relationship to the theme of fables which is lame at best the milk song makes no sense in relationship to the props at the beginning the female audience is told to expect some beefcake but the two males in the show are not that great the one playing the wolf character is not handsome at all and struts around like a goon not a man the f bombs from the peepshow diva were really unnecessary other than displaying her body holly madison is a great disappointment she cannot sing she barely speaks and her lines are horrible and i like her this is the very first show i have attended where people actually walked out two separate groups at two different spots in the show how this got to be a show in a major hotel for so long is beyond me high school students could put on a better show save your time and your money i wish we ha}

{53543, Olive Gourmet, 9832 W Northern Ave Ste 1660 Peoria AZ 85345, i love buying and cooking with flavored olive oils and vinegars olive gourmet opened up near my house right as i was running low and i needed to stop in immediately the owners are very nice and friendly the selection of olive oils they have on hand is great and the quality is outstanding i like that i was able to sample the olive oils and balsamics in the store before buying them and i frequently stop by just to see whats new fantastic store and im glad it opened when my bff when on a rave about this olive oil place that she had found i thought to myself hmmm sounds interesting but i certainly wasnt breaking any speed limits to get there and yet today i barely had one foot in the door when i realized the error of my dismissive ways it wasnt that i didnt know these things existed quite contraire but until now there was no place on the west side that one could do tastings and pairings this is essential if you are a little obsessive about cooking i dont even quite know where to begin except to say that i seriously had to control my urge to buy one of each and as the lovely couple that owns the establishment was packing up my case yes i said case i decided that this was potentially a dangerous place for me to frequent they have a selection of both nine plain which is sort of a misnomer as you can make your selection from mild to robust flavors and twelve flavored oils flavored oils that made the cut today were the all natural buttered which i have already lightly drizzled over steamed veggies and had i not known would have thought i was being overly sinful the owner suggested a light sprinkle over pop corn and i am so there with her on that one the next up was basil fresh and herby the mix of the crisp oo combined with the sweet smoothness of the basil well lets just say yum garlic was the third one that made its way in to the box this evoo will be a staple in lightly flavoring the pan on anything mediterranean or italian that passes across my stove top the organic tuscan herb is the obvious choice for dipping either crudites or crusty bread this one is so popular they were temporarily out so i was only able to sample trust me i will be back for this one the final oil that came home was the one of the three specialty oils i chose the toasted almond this one is a couple of dollars more but wow this would be phenomenal for a healthier baking substitute any kind of salad with a nutty flair fruit i swear you could drizzle this on ice cream and that leads me to the balsamics they have flavored traditional reds whites and specialties today i picked up the strawberry to pair with the basil oo sprinkle this combination over some watermelon with mint and no one will be able to resist you i snagged the white cranberry pear for its tart start with a sweet finish i cant wait to use this in my fall recipes and have already started working up ideas for holiday meals that will star this little number the dark chocolate is going to be perfect with strawberries and im pretty sure when paired with the toasted almond oil will be sublime when all was said and done i had filled up the better part of a case and had a smile from ear to ear now looking back at their website i am kicking myself for not having tried at least other items i will have to settle for creating my own combinations of flavors until i return to add to the collection the best part of all of this is that is is actually reasonably priced for the quality quite a decent value when you consider that you will be using teaspoons or at most a tablespoon to produce huge flavors and is a vast improvement health wise as a substitute for more traditional alternatives they have a punch card program that earns your free products and are open days a week i dearly hope people try this place and keep it afloat it is without a doubt my new crush i was on the hunt for fancy specialty olives to make a special olive vodka for the holidays saw this place was opened and so excited until we found out they do not sell a single olive at the olive gourmet how is this possible frankly i am shocked and oh so dissapointed i was pleased to find we have a gourmet olive oil and vinegar store olive gourmet here in the west valley for me it is only a short mile drive to this newish upscale mall park west mall in surprise i was encouraged to visit olive gourmet after reading julie ps enthusiastic yelp review and im so glad i did og has olive oils including flavored olive oils and over balsamic vinegars all are available for tasting their products are sold in attractive tall oz bottles after tasting i chose the tuscan herb olive oil it has the most delicious subtle taste of herbs i find its perfect for dipping bread and adding to cooked vegetables my other choice was the raspberry balsamic vinegar intense and smooth ive made my own raspberry vinaigrette from it so ill forget about buying prepared dressings after tasting mine betsy the friendly and helpful saleslady was a pleasure to do business with while there i sampled a wonderful lemon pound cake made from their lemon olive oil it was delicious and they shared the recipe olive gourmets frequent buyer card is an incentive to visit again my next visit will be to purchase their heavenly dark chocolate balsamic vinegar im told it is wonderful over fresh strawberries cant wait there are precious few interesting gourmet food places in the west valley but olive gourmet is one of them located on northern just west of the in the park west mall sample both plain and flavored olive oils and flavored balsamic vinegars it did strike me as odd that you sample the oils and vinegars straight and not with bread or crackers but i suppose you get a better sense of the flavor that way word to the wise do not fill the entire sample cup with olive oil or you will feel obligated to drink it all i find that just enough to cover the bottom of the cup is about right for a good taste the owners are in the store all the time and happy to help or chat surprisingly enough the prices are pretty reasonable even or maybe especially for the aged balsamic vinegars they also have a stamp card where after purchasing a certain number of bottles you get one free enjoy trying all the combinations of balsamics and olive oils hard to decided on just a few at a time glad they have oz bottles to buy for and try different flavors their hours were limited the beginning of nov due to a family emergency all is well and back to regular hours i have over small bottles that i am sending to family for christmas great stocking stuffers there are all sorts of gift packages available for your holiday shopping and gift giving great selection of olive oils and vinegars i always come to get my traditional balsamic vinegar maybe some picual olive oil and sometimes sesame seed oil it is a fun place to come sample buy some stuff and talk to the owners if youve never tried good olive oil give this place a whirl and before going crazy on the flavored vinegars try the traditional balsamic just once it is worth it ive been searching for some good quality olive oils this came up while on yelp parking was easy off to the side the lady working was so sweet i told her this was my first time visiting so she explained the different oils vinegars theres mini cups to sample everything i tried the espresso balsamic which was so amazing but i decided to go with just a plain balsamic since thats what i was needing i also got small sample about oz of the organic garlic olive oil im actually regretting not getting a bigger bottle because this stuff is amazing i think im going to be putting little bottles in everyones stockings for christmas haha prices were fair theres so many different flavors to try next time ill be picking up the chipotle olive oil which i sampled was great definitely worth a trip here to taste and purchase flavored and unflavored olive oils and unusual balsamic vinegars the tuscan oil is good enough to eat with just a piece of bread in addition to olive oils there was truffle oil toasted sesame oil and i believe toasted almond oil all available for tasting normally i dont like balsamic vinegar but i tried the coconut peach pomegranate and something else i forgot and every one of them was not only delicious but smooth in texture as well the best part is you can buy a sample size of a few ounces so you can see if you really like it and have enough uses for your selection i hope they do mail order because i dont get to az often enough to enjoy all their goodies}
{13412, Crane Alley, 115 W Main St Urbana IL 61801, i tried their shrimp pasta it was bland and had a weird taste the service was a little slow but friendly the portions are good but for the price i hoped the taste would have been a little more pleasing in my mind this is a first and foremost a bar an awesome bar with an a lofted upper level that looks down on the pool tables a bar that has more private cozy seating in the back a bar that sets up outside in the breezeway cranes alley great beer selection decent prices lots of seating it was a pretty classy addition to downtown urbana when it first opened and fooseball there are some crazy fooseball sharks dont let their meager appearance fool you i like crane alley i think i would go there more if i lived in urbana living in deep west champaign i never really feel like it has anything to offer me that i need to drive to urbana for i like their food alot especially balsamic spinach strawberry goat cheese salad ah and think the vibe is pretty nice clean waitresses cleavage unexposed no patrons likely to puke most of the time ive had really slow service there alot of times especially up in the loft large selection of good beers unfortunately everything else is bad insipid sugary cocktails and overpriced food ive rarely had anything good here the beet chips are pretty good but the wings seem to be soaked in battery acid and the tempura is just gross who fries moist baby carrots i had some good steak once but that was quite unusual come for pool and drinks leave when you get hungry i went here not long after it opened a few years back and the food was great on the expensive side for bar food but great i would stop in every now and again but not very frequently due to the prices the last time i went was about months ago i dont know what happened but the food was terrible i had butternut squash ravioli in a cream sauce and it was just awful no flavor completely devoid of seasoning and the sauce may have been the elmers paste that comes in the little tubs with the brush attached to the cap it was actually grey in color gross my husband had a chicken sandwich and it was small cold and cost about three times what hed have paid for the exact same sandwich quality wise from mcdonalds the evening set us back about bucks for a salad appetizer two entrees and two draft beers which is pricey for cu so not worth it we have no plans to go back im sad to see that this place has been getting such bad reviews this was my favorite place to eat when i lived in champaign i have not been there in at least months so i am rating it on my past experiences i have had so many awesome dinners here and i like the beer selection im gonna return next time im in town to see if its really as bad as these reviews say servers are wonderfully friendly there are approximately beers available the drink selection is broad and the bar is huge and several of the sandwiches and appetizers are delicious when youre there do try the potato pancakes in a light cheesecream sauce omg it tastes like magic i might be exaggerating but only slightly goat cheese and hummus appetizers were great so were the sweet potato fries the regular fries meh if i was better at billards id come here more often however this place has a really chill ambience where you can just relax at the bar sort of like b street billards in san mateo ca if you know what i mean went here for dinner front room has a long bar and a few billiard tables back room has seating for diners we were seated right away large selection of microbrews by the bottle crowd a mixture of families and students enjoyed the hummus dip to start we had sandwiches i had a turkey reuben and the others had burgers solid comfort food type dining the first time i came to crane alley i had trouble finishing my beer in the smoke haven that is the outside seating section of the bar im pretty sure i nearly died that night the second time i came i ordered one of their incredibly over priced martinis and it tasted like triaminic no joke when i told the server that it was awful he brought me some sprite to put in it and said it was all he could do believe it or not the sprite made it soooo much worse luckily my face was so contorted with the bad taste it convinced the server to go against bar policy and bring me something else i had to pay for my new drink but luckily he took the first one off my tab the third time i came i had the potato pancakes and fell in love yumyumyum in summation crane alley is a good place i always go back but like many places in urbana and champaign its can be a hit or miss you just have to be willing to take the chance i would however stick with the large and in charge beer menu and the more common mixed beverages the martinis are way over priced and i just never every want to taste triaminic spiked with vodka again thankyoumuch you will not find hoards of undergraduates here it might even be hard to find more than a few grad students and yet it has one of the best beer selections in town a restaurant and full sized pool tables drinking beer and playing pool is probably one of my favorite ways to hang out and this is the perfect place for it i dont know if i should let this get out much but wednesday is half off pool night i played with other people last week for a couple of hours and they charged us only each thats ridiculous its also not loud at all for a bar they have outdoor seating in the alley when its warm and the background music is usually a pleasant mix of classic rock about the restaurant dont go here during off hours not dinner i dont think the regular kitchen is working or something is off i wish they had a few cheaper more suited to a bar kind of appetizers than they do especially since their above average overall food quality would make fantastic late night snacks the guyfriends manage and are usually hungry enough to eat entire sandwiches and meals by the end of the night so they dont complain great burgers and great beers even though this place is close to the campus its far enough a way from the regular places the kids go so that is not too loud and rambunctious even on st paddys day the burger really was absolutely great even cooked to medium well it was so juicy that the first bite left a puddle of flavor on the plate oh yeah which then got soaked up by their great french fries and they have rouges kells irish lager on tap and man is that tasty great service too and the prices were just right i like a fair amount of other people think that crane alley is pretty hitmiss i love their beer selection and their bartenders are friendly we were their last weekend and their hostess almost drove us to insanity we had a group of and two tables opened up more than enough so seat us all and instead of pushing them together she sat people at the person table and then let the other sit empty at that point we were told the wait would be minutes after an hour still with empty tables we went to ask she said shed seat us in minutes and finally minutes later after bugging her twice more she got us a table the bartenders actually compted us the pool because they felt so bad that being said our waitress was very friendly though not always present but very accommodating food was ok but we were annoyed that we waited hours to be seated when there were empty tables the entire time we started to wonder if she was mad at certain wait staff members and trying to spite them by not sitting people in their sections that being said i have had much better experiences there and i hope that never happens to anyone else i like the beer selection but we went there for a birthday party where i brought a cake and they wanted to charge me a plate fee it was so absurd we had all bought dinner a bottle of wine etc it seems like they dont want groups to converge there ill go somewhere else next time this place used to be my favorite place in urbana followed closely by the office well now the office is closed and i feel like crane alley is shell of what it used to be in fact i never go out in urbana anymore one star for serving food all night and one star for never being too crowded and loud if i only have expectations to hang out with friends at night im not disappointed i loved the food about years ago but recently the food quality has declined and the service is horrible we met up with friends there they had been there for about an hour lets just say we got our food before their order was taken we were at adjacent tables outside at lunchtime bad why the third star this is where my boyfriend and i went on our first date over three years ago obviously it was a good date crane alley is wonderful they have a very extensive beer list friendly staff yummy food pool tables and a great beer garden in the adjacent alley crane alley is a good place for after work cocktails lunch dinner and just hangin out the fine young cannibal reccomends the beet chips and black bean burger id give this place stars but theres this dude named stern who always goes there jeezuz service is incredibly accommodating food is pretty darn good pool tables with a nice cozy darkness that doesnt attract too many obnoxious student types check just like any other great bar until you notice that they have dark horse crooked tree ipa on tap and theyre planning a dinner event to honor dogfish head where theyll be tapping a keg of the holy minute ipa impressive way to stock the best beers i didnt realize those vendors even made it down to central illinois oh and i almost forgot they have beet chips with a chevre dipping sauce definitely worth a go mushroom and spinach lasagna with cream sauce the noodles were nice and thin the alfredo style bechamel flavorful this was a nice surprise a bit pricy though chicken parm had a weird pepperoncini sauce on top that subtracted from the dish the marinara was not as good as the lasagnas alfredo the breaded chicken breast was crispy and cooked to perfection buffalo chicken sandwich very good huge portion i prefer to get the buffalo sauce and ranch cant have blue cheese while pregnant on the side and dip otherwise the breading gets soggy chicken is very well cooked italian roast beef the beef used was too lean it was dry and chewy would benefit from using ribeye like on a good philly cheesesteak or a well braised chuck roast that has enough fat to keep the meat tender the au jus was not very flavorful tasted mostly like oil red pepper flakes nice beer list they have beer dinners or but they wont discount the ticket if you are unable to drink alcohol e g pregnant me otherwise my husband and i would have loved to have gone to one ive been a little stingy with my stars these days and im tempted to rate this but the sweet potato fries there is just nothing like them ive been here twice now during my quarterly visits to c u the food burgers in both instances has been consistently good now i live really really close to the infamous kumas corner in chicago their burgers are so famous theyve been featured on the food network that having been said my standards are pretty high and cranes i must say makes a darn tasty burger today i had the special burger with mole roasted chilies pork shoulder and chihuahua cheese oooohhhh yes aside from tasty burgers their beer selection rocks they literally have one full page of ipas and thats just the tip of the iceberg their draft beers which i believe rotate are quality as well the place is big their outdoor alley seating is great in the summer and the service is good though i must warn you my first time in the summer was during some crayfish special tables of rowdy bikers cheered on ladies in leather bumping and grinding in their laps im not sure what was going on and i dont know if it is somehow related to the crayfish just thought it was worth mentioning chanting in that well worn beat cadence overrated overrated the food here is extremely hit or miss eating here three times i have been very disappointed twice with my own meal and all three times with some aspect of the dining experience their menu sounds good but is perhaps beyond the skill of its staff as they often fail to deliver sauces are either too thin or too thick either tasteless or too salty and every time at least one item was served too cold even when it was just of us if you are the type that likes to occasionally order an appetizer for your entree think again many apps are really skimpy also food service can be very slow at times as i think they stretch their servers too thin they also have very few vegetarian options which surprises me based upon their clientele notice how all these comments are about food that is because their alcohol service selection and quality are all beyond reproach their prices including their alcohol prices are pretty high for what you get for the alcohol i can justify this to cover the cost of carrying obscure barley wines tremendous to charge high prices for the food is absolutely unacceptable eat at v picassos courier cafe bunnys tang dynasty the great impasta xinh xinh black dog silver creek or even siam terrace then drink at crane alley crane alley is known in town for its beer selection theyve got like rotating taps and hundreds of different bottles the table service has gotten better recently i think some bad servers quit or something the bartenders who work at night are always knowledgeable about their beer they are great at making recommendations the menu has a good variety their food specials are usually a good deal too i went in last friday with my mom the cute little hostess seated us exactly where my mom wanted to sit she can be quite difficult and our server was attentive and friendly crane alley is the only bar i go to in urbana and has the best bottled beer menu of any bar in the area in addition it will have more than draft beers at any one time from various microbreweries and craft breweries the reasons to stop by dont stop there since there is also a fairly extensive menu of tavern style food which is higher quality than what one usually comes across my favorite appetizer is crane alleys signature beet chips every table around us got this appetizer since it is one of the dishes that crane alley is most known for the beet chips come with a bowl of a goat cheese dip which has cream cheese mixed in the dip is somewhat rich and heavy and helps to bulk up what might otherwise be a rather light appetizer the sandwiches at crane alley run up to around and the main courses a bit higher than that last visit my girlfriend got a portabella mushroom burger which was one of the daily specials and of course had no meat however it was bulky enough to offset that and not be as light and unfilling as a lot of vegetarian food ends up being i got a beer battered fish sandwich which was crispy and fairly large way too much fish for the bun along with the sweet potato fries another thing crane alley is known for one of the complaints i usually have about fried fish sandwiches is how greasy they are but luckily this sandwich didnt fall into that trap the primary lure that crane alley has is its wide selection of beers and drinks which can be ordered alongside a selection of appetizers or food something some local competitors do not offer in addition it has weekly special dishes and daily specials and special beer and food pairings on set dates tickets must usually be purchased i would highly recommend anyone in the area or at the university make the effort to stop here at least once i have to agree with those holding the over rated opinion the best thing about crane alley is the drinkin they have loads of beer selection the bar is well stocked and we all got a little over appreciative of their fine scotch selections the food and service though both left much to be desired they serve typical pub food with some updatestwists beet chips why not our apps were all ok not great the service was slow like stuck in tar slow everything here is on the expensive side go for a night of trying different brewsliquors eat somewhere tastier before heading over every time i watch the how i met your mother episode best burger in new york i go off in search of something to satisfy that craving there are a lot of mediocre burgers in chambana but you wont find that at crane alley my favorite was the burger with mushrooms gorgonzola cheese and caramelized onions the patty was perfectly cooked and flavorful and i could imagine obsessing over it like they did in the episode tv related gushing aside i really like this place we also tried the steak frites with gorgonzola butter on top and those were wonderful and the beer selection is great i like trying the flights myself so i dont have to commit to a full version of any one thing the normal fries are not great nothing especially wrong with them just not great also the steak sandwich was good but whereas the steak sandwiches im used to are best shared with at least one other person this is more of a one person sandwich unless youre not that hungry be sure to keep up on their facebook page they have awesome beer dinners or other cool events from time to time i went to a great beer and chocolate pairing a few weeks ago and keep hoping there will be another my favorite place in town i started going there because i live close by the food is excellent slightly creative pub style excellent beer selection rotating taps mean youll always find something new waitstaff seem to have been turning over a lot lately which can lead to inconsistent service usually good though dont order the fish here its clearly frozen not fresh ive been to this restaurant several times with groups while theres a decent drinkbeer selection it seems like most of the time alot of the food items on the menu are not available the one thing i do love about this place is their sweet potato fries which is topped with brown sugar this is definately more of a bar snacks kind of place and not so much a sit down restaurant though they try and as far as bars go there are less expensive and better elsewhere in town many great revolving beers on tap and a delish black bean burger play pool inside or sit outside i love this joint i was concerned about crane alley as soon as i saw the menu the styles ranged from classic italian to middle eastern to contemporary americana dont let all that fool you into believing this is some kind of fusion joint it is just a confused menu we ordered the calamari as a starter it was competently fried and the sauce had a nice kick to it albeit bordering on pizza sauce we ordered the turkey pita sandwich and the chicken parm dont mistake that to mean that the sandwich was in the pocket no the fillings were served between two cold halves of pita the chicken parm was mediocre at best more likely just plain bad managed to burn the top of the mozzarella and still have borderline doneness on the breast the worst part of it all is that this place is priced like a downtown chicago eatery i will say the staff was courteous and friendly ultimately this is a bar if you want a plethora of beer and cocktail options and maybe a burger go for it if you want a decent meal at a reasonable price steer clear some good beers on tap and a couple tables for stick good buffalo chicken sandwich awesome range of food and beer and the atmosphere is nice this place has to be one of my top in champaign urbana especially in the summer when you can sit in the actual alley itself not to mention this place is great for some low key billiards and beer after dinner i want to like this place more because the service is good and the space itself is inviting i like being here but the food is mediocre the burgers are mealy and taste more like seasoning than meat nothing ive had here is remarkable and ive been lots of times since its a great place to meet up with friends and drink this was my go to place when i lived in urbana cant beat the beerfoodbilliards combo excellent beer selection with large number of rotating brews on tap food is pretty good ive had a few so so experiences but generally i am very pleased i recently made a trip back to crane alley for dinner and was dismayed by the alterations to the menu primarily the price i remember buying affordable sandwiches for around but all sandwiches have been bumped up to the to range for a falafel sandwich really those falafels are little nuggets of luxury now quality of the food ranges from standard to good though there is usually nothing here that smacks of culinary sophistication especially to justify charging for a falafel sandwich when im feeling indulgent i order the fish sandwich which is all the greasy crunchy crusted fish i could want appetizers here are decent the spinach and artichoke dip tastes like every homemade version ive sampled from friends kitchens the beet chips with goat cheese are considered one of their hallmark dishes i agree theyre good when prepared properly its a gamble because of the color of the beets i think its difficult to distinguish when theyre finished cooking i often get beet chips that taste like black charcoal when friends propose coming here for happy hour after work i just kind of dread it crane alley presents itself as a barpub but they are more like a formal restaurant that expects everyone to stay in their assigned seats as someone whos waited tables in the past i know large groups are challenging but the waitresses here look downright insulted when they realize they have to serve our table they mostly avoid our group and hope that we wont ask for anything more than one meal and one drink once we showed up at a busy hour with a group of and had to wait to be seated no big deal no one was complaining we just stood in a group and chatted amongst ourselves after a few minutes the hostess approached us obviously annoyed and said if you have a group this big in the future youre going to have to call in advance to make a reservation ugh really sadly downtown urbana does not offer many options for night life especially if you want to have a nice drink with your meal crane alley has broad appeal and is a general crowd pleaser so it is a safe option for a date or outing with friends just make sure you dont bring too many friends ive been to crane alley or times the first time i went i had the chicken pesto with goat cheese and red peppers it was so good that i keep coming back just for that its so good that i dont want to try anything else im from the chicago area so i can only visit a few times per year i was there yesterday and they just put on a new beer bitburger from germany it was on special and it was a great beer that went along great with my outstanding sandwich i had lunch with a friend at crane alley yesterday id never been there but had heard mostly good things im going to agree with that assessment mostly good i had the portobello sandwich with peppers and a nice pesto topping i was sort of disappointed when my friend said she wasnt into beet chips as an appetizer but completely excited when i saw i could substitute my fries for beet chips yay we ended up sharing the spinach and artichoke dip app it came with toasted pita slices mmmmm the food was interesting and it was good it wasnt fantastic or mind blowing but it was solid and the menu had a good variety of selections the price wasnt super cheap but it wasnt outrageous for lunch my sandwich plus beet chips which do carry a surcharge as a substitution my friends entree a bowl of the soup of the day and a reuben one soft drink and our appetizer before tip the drink menu is huge id love to come back for dinner and drinks sometime the ambiance screams youre in a bar which considering that hey youre in a bar that works it was cozy the lighting was low the booths black might be a nice place for a casual date the one aspect that shone above all was the service our waiter was fantastic he was knowledgeable about the menu helpful without being pushy or overbearing very attentive we had regular drink refills but he didnt make it hard for us to continue our conversation he even brought us an assortment of to go containers so we could keep the dip and pita chips separate what a guy that waiter deserves five stars and a large tip best place in central illinois for beer selection cannot be topped solid food too but the real reason to go here is if one covets craft brews staff are friendly as hell bartenders knowledgeable and prices arent too bad thumbs up a must hit for connoisseurs ive been here twice now and both times i had great food and even better beer their food menu is pretty extensive and the artichoke dip is amazing drink menu is huge a wide selection of beers ensure youll never have to repeat a bottle unless you find a favorite the ambience during the afternoon is great both times i came here and occupied a booth in the corner to get some work done while i enjoyed some food and a beer a little pricey but their chili is the best in the city lunch specials are always a welcome treat as well try to make it here at least once in a while i like the buffalo chicken sandwich here i also like the selection of beers and flights real chill place to go and kick it with some buddies or to start off a night best blackbean burger ever in my life i miss crane alley it was my go to restaurant in the cu area always blackbean burger no sprouts with a side of greek pasta salad even better with a bloody mary or a spicy martini theres a specific one that im talking about but i cant remember what its called they also have an amazing beer selection every time i go there are a few new draft beers definitely try a beer flight oh and the sweet potato fries so goooooddddd ive tried a few other items on the menu but after finding the blackbean burger there was never a reason to order anything else seriously the best ever million stars i eat here semi frequently because there is a lack of mid range priced restaurants in town that arent thai chinese korean etc and this has some meals that i would classify as mid range in price i e about for a meal plus tip and tax i think the food is ok but some of the stuff on the menu is just overpriced this could be the most overrated place in cu beer selection good everything else pretty bad service was particularly bad when we went and the food was not great for the price we ordered desert before our appetizers because we particularly wanted one of the options by the time we finished our main course the waiter informed us that they had just sold out of the dessert we had ordered long before we were shocked by his honesty and incompetence stopped by here for lunchdinner it was what meal does that count as it was pretty quiet since we didnt come during regular lunchdinner hours crane alley is a restaurant bar but it definitely feels more like a bar than a restaurant its very dimly lit there are pool tables and a large bar area i guess if you like barsfeel comfortable in bars you probably wont notice this i got the veggie sandwich and it was amazingly good please allow me to list the ingredients of this most tasty of sandwiches cucumber bell peppers onion tomato sprouts lettuce basil oil sunflower seeds and dill cream cheese all on two big slices of wheat bread the greek pasta salad was also tasty and overall it was a very satisfying generous portioned meal for a little under my boyfriend had a hamburger and it was huge the fries were good and he liked the burger although he said it had some kind of seasoning on it which he seemed kind of eh about between the two of us we spent about before tip and without any drinks not bad the desserts also sounded really good flourless chocolate cake mmm but we passed on that this time ill definitely be back i feel like if i had any interest in beer then this would be my new favorite place but since im not a fan of beer or bars in general thats kind of a deterrent for me completely aware im in the minority here oh well ill still come back for their yummy food i love crane alley they have a great selection of sandwiches at reasonable prices and the best beer selection in town i find the fridaysaturday specials are always creative and amazing you cant go wrong with the frequently offered beef ragout nachos but bring people to help you finish seating outside is quite pleasant except then you miss interacting with the friendly bartenders inside the service is friendly with just the right amount of attentiveness and they are nice to our dogs they have a fantastic beer list and the food is very good although pricey for what you get the service is the reason for my low score if not for the weak service i would give the restaurant either a or i went and ordered a beer that the menu stated was ounces the glass it was brought in was clearly not ounces when i brought it to the waitresses attention she argued the point finally we were able to demonstrate that the beer really was less than ounces and she took off the price of the bill i prefer restaurants who take their customers more seriously than this based on my food alone stars i had blackened tuna pita with petit salad and it was amazing as served my husband had a fried fish sandwich and it wasnt great but nothing compares to destihls fried fish the service was terrible our waitress was in a foul mood and had a bad attitude with every table in our section some of the best burgers in town they also have seasonalweekly items that are prepared using local produce other menu items are delicious and reasonably priced beer selection us decent only negative would be it can usually be loud but that is to be expected in a good location so overall the food here ive had has been really good i will say though that if you go to crane alley its not as cheap as some of the other area restaurants esp not the alcohol another thing my friends and i noticed is that if you get appetizers they normally give you way more dipping material hummus spinach and artichoke dip etc than you can use up with the pita provided you will get charged extra if you ask for more pita they always have a nice selection of beverages particularly beers but theres a cocktail list as well again just plan on it being pricey if fresh and local is important to you they also sometimes have menu items made from products of sellers you might see at market at the square in the summer in the end its a great place to go when the weather is nice and you can sit outside in the evening with your friends in the actual alley part of crane alley first off free pool till all around this place is an excellent weekend afternoon relaxation spot we stopped in this past saturday around it wasnt empty but it was far from busy and the pool tables were unoccupied if i didnt live out of town this would be my march madness go to spot second other good details i got the turkey pita which was just the right size fresh and slightly crunchy pita bread plenty of meat and delicious with guacamole the beer selection here is impressive covering a wide range of styles and breweries from around the country i consider myself fairly familiar with the microbrew landscape and yet they still had about beers that i had never even heard of plus crane alley does modestly priced flights of x ounce tasters a buck for the really obscure choices the servers were all nice and quick to help out whenever we needed them the food tastes pretty fresh ive never had something to eat here and thought it came from a can or a box or a freezer maybe it did but i was fooled it tastes clean the beer well theres a lot to choose from and thats good too however the prices sigh this isnt chicago there are a lot of places to get hummus probably better and more authentic hummus too it used to be a little more affordable and now it is a little less so especially considering the food hasnt gotten any better the service is just okay if you go when its not busy like the middle of the day in the middle of the week its great ive been on weekend evenings and the waiters seem to have more than they are capable of handling all in all its an okay place i dont generally object if someone suggests going there because the alcohol selection is pretty rad there are also pool tables so you can sit and have a good beer and play the thing that saves it for me is the outdoor seating in the summer time its really nice to be able to hang out with friends and enjoy a decent dinner and a few drinks its good its not great but you could definitely do worse in this town my opinion of the food remains the same its okay seems fresh still costs more than it should however wait service yikes its never been great but my experience last night was not awesome i was waited on by a guy with a deep v and plenty of chest hair he seemed put out by everything and not in the slightest hurry to do anything refill drinks take orders smile my party wasnt ready to order when we first arrived we ordered drinks and an appetizer we brought it and plunked it down on the table not saying a word he didnt return to our table for over minutes in other words a long ass time when we finally ordered it took a long time to come out of the kitchen i could understand if it were busy but it wasnt there were four tables sitting outside and only one other table inside sitting beside my party of three a couple of guys at the bar i have had a lot of meh experiences at crane alley and really for the food its just not worth it smile deep v guy seriously if youre gonna be slow at least be gracious people love the affable slow poke too cool for school and slow never won popularity contests pros great drinks friendly service fun busy atmosphere interesting large menu my favs are the mediterranean style mezze plate and the falafel sandwich both of which are pretty rare to find around here great specials reasonable prices good healthy options cons booth area is slightly odd in terms of interior design i wish they would revamp it and make it less claustrophobic somehow good burgers good beer need more im not usually at crane for food but eat there occasionally enjoy whatever i order the drink selection is exceptional especially beers the drafts are rotated frequently are a little pricey but not unexpectedly so overall a great place for a couple beers on the patio imo one of the only reasons to ever go into urbana this is a place i visit often when i come back to see the family a nice bar with pool tables and an area upstairs there is a nice beer garden in the alley next to the bar plenty of goodies on tap and in bottles boulevard smokestack offerings some flossmoor station two brothers dfh a really good bottle list too i believe they also have a monthly beer club that meets here as well the food is great lots of sandwiches and several other entrees that are top notch they have the best fish sandwich in champaingurbana a good burger and reuben about the only thing i have to complain about is the service the waitresses can be slow and dont always get the order right besides that a great place to quaff some quality beers in downtown urbana i love this place the food is surprisingly good since i have a dairy allergy i stick to the turkey pita club and its delicious every time also good hummus calamari soup of the day every time onion rings bbq bacon burger dont let the pool tables fool you this is a classy joint lets start with the good parts great beer and scotch list the food was good fresh and hot so much for the good stuff the wait service bad is an understatement we where seated the waitress took our drink order we got our drinks and she was gone finally we were able to get her attention and ask if we could order we got our food and she was gone again had to go find her or yell at her as she zipped by to get anything you needed or wanted even drink refills its a bar at least keep my beer full boy do you pay for the bad service you get crab cakes appetizer fish sandwich ruben sandwich beers not including tip a little steep for bar food great draft beer selection try the blackened tuna on pita bread it was perfectly done seared rare in the summer you can sit at outdoor tables in the alley i love that you can sit outside with your dog they even bring out a bowl of water for your pup this coupled with the draft beers makes it one of my favorites they have a huge selection of beers and rotation of drafts the drink menu is like a small novel if you cant decide the serversbartenders are knowledgeable and will help you make a choice i have ordered food here a couple of times and was amazed at how good everything was love crane alley huge selection of beers and they make excellent cocktails the atmosphere is mellow and causal and in nice weather there is great seating outside pool tables in the main floor along with a long bar and plenty of seating the food is surprisingly excellent bar fare i was expecting the food to be okay and was pleasantly surprised i frequent crane alley every week and my favorites are their burgers and their fish sandwich they are a bit pricey but for what you get in terms of quality and atmosphere i think it is a good deal i grew up in urbana and many times with so many great places to eat in the c ucampustown area it can be hard to choose where to go something everyone can always agree to is crane alley the food is amazing and way better quality than most bars can claim the sweet potato fries are a must try and i also love the turkey pita sandwich also a great selection of beers and full bar not to mention a great atmosphere i love to sit in the alley in the summer definitely one of my favorite spots at home the craft beer battered fish is a great deal for a quality fish sandwich they do not skim out on the filet at all and they serve it when its still deliciously hot they also toast the bun to give it an extra crunch i normally eat half and save the other half for later but i couldnt resist my plate was completely cleaned by the time we left i also ordered a small soup on the side it was the blue cheese tomato soup and that was really great too we came during lunch so there was no wait at all id imagine a long wait later on during the day first time at this place it was starting to get busy and loud near the bar area we got seated near the back they have a small gluten free menu all you have to do is ask i got bbq salmon with sauteed veg and garlic mashed potato it was fresh and delicious and well presented my wife got a side salad with a cup of soup which was ham chicken and corn chowder service was great and our server was a delight will definitely be back great location in downtown urbana great beer selection and friendly wait staff the food is also generally very good i especially recommend the spinach artichoke dip sooo yummy but sadly a little skimpy on the pita that goes w it beers arent cheap but ive never been anywhere w such a great selection pretty nice beer garden area on the side of the building as well rock solid this place will impress even the biggest beer snob in the group especially if belgians are preferred crane alley is champaign urbanas answer to chicagos hopleaf no kidding i enjoyed a gulden draak and my husband had the local option american muscle they have a fabulous albeit limited food menu and a weekly pool tournament the servers are friendly knowledgeable and there are several dining areas away from the bar and pool tables for those who require a bit more privacy my only complaint is the presence of babies kids and teens in the room one of my biggest pet peeves next time im visiting my parents in shampoo banana ill certainly return to crane alley mehhhh this place is okay nothing worth going back to my friend and i were in urbana and we decide to try out crane alley mainly because black dog was closed he said he hear it was good it wasnt before i begin the food wasnt bad per say but it wasnt great and for the price of the burger i got it definitely wasnt worth it i got the burger thinking well its the most expensive one should be pretty tasty right wrong i substituted the fries for the soup of the day which was jambalaya blah the jambalaya was actually pretty decent not amazing but it was pretty hardy the burger came out and it just seemed like crane alley was trying to do too much on one burger it had blue cheese dijon mustard bacon and a few other things that didnt go together great ive also forgot the name of the burger it was the only one over i almost gave this place stars but i felt kinda bad because it seems like they have a good beer selection and the staff is very polite would i go back probably not rather spend my money on the better places to eat in urbana champaign i would consider going back for a drink but nothing else crane alley is by far the best urbana bar well okay maybe thats not saying much but this place does stand on its merits its equal parts restaurant and bar you can get a drink or a meal whether youre at a table or the bar there are also a couple of pool tables across from the bar and when its warm out you can sit at a table in the eponymous alley next to the bar do this at night it can feel downright romantic beneath the strings of little lightbulbs crane alley has an excellent beer selection they always have a dozen or so good ones on tap and the bartenders and servers are knowledgeable enough to give recommendations i think they do beer tastings and whiskey tastings although ive never been the liquor selection is good with an emphasis on whiskey and there are a couple of menu pages dedicated to sweet cocktails i usually ordered beer here but the few mixed drinks i had were well made food wise they serve burgers pasta steaks and appetizers i was an especially big fan of the portobello mushroom sandwich a burger type sandwich with a mushroom instead of meat and roasted red pepper feta and pesto and the potato pancakes a decently sized appetizer that comes with asparagus and a tasty cream sauce my only complaint about this place is that some of the meals feel overpriced my friend ordered the hanger steak once and it was not worth of steak oh and i wish they had kept the beet chips on the menu paired with a goat cream cheese for dipping they were awesome but they disappeared from the menu sometime last year downtown urbana actually has a handful of restaurants and bars but for whatever reason most of them feel like exclusively townie haunts crane alley and black dog are the two exceptions and unless youre specifically in the mood for barbecue and are willing to wait an hour for a table at black dog crane alley is the place to go its too far from campus for the undergrads so its usually a mix of grad students and professionals you can eat a burger at the bar you can grab a beer and play pool or you can treat your date to fancy cocktails and a nice dinner in the upstairs loft highly recommended this place is horrible the waiters are rude and the food is average the waiter i had never came back and filled our drinks and was nothing but rude to me and my family the salad also tasted of dirt like they plucked it fresh out of the garden and didnt wash it i love crane alley their corn beef sandwich is top notch the staff is fantastic and the atmosphere is pretty good the alley with the lights hanging over the buildings in the summer time is pretty terrific you can sit there and sooner or later as people are walking through the conversations start everyone seems to know each other they have plenty of assorted beers and the best desert had about meals here over the years glad they are in downtown urbana great people work here good good good drink selectionbeerbooze i have not strayed to far from my faves so i can not really give a fair array of menu reviews here that said what i have had i adore if you like beer then this place is for you no really if you like beer you should come here now this place features all kinds of local beers from the il area in addition to featuring a ton of other great microbrews from across the country i wouldnt come here in a rush because you need some time to actually read through all of their beer selections there are that many it is a mini binder so come ready to read about beer taste beer and enjoy beer and then maybe even play a little pool until the pool league comes in that is since they have a league here a few days a week they also have beer samplers and i have to say that matt j and i were very impressed with our bar tender in that she not only remembered the different beers we ordered but then recited them back in order in increasing light to dark beers as well amazing that is the type of bar tender at a great beer place that you want so hats off to her the food looked pretty good here too and everyone here just seemed happy in general it is a darker bar restaurant on the inside so good for group outings or dates i would say but if you dont like beer you will be missing the main draw of this place nothing worth going back for except for the beer which was fantastic food made me think of glorified leftovers and overpriced at that i had the steak sandwich and was very underwhelmed it came on two pieces of what tasted like wonderbread and the gondolzasp was almost nonexistent great atmosphere and our waitress was very attentive dont think ill be back for the food though personally i have greatly enjoyed all of my trips to crane alley theres plenty of options for vegetarians my favorite appetizers are the hummus which is served with warm pita bread and the sweet potato fries which are dusted with brown sugar and served with barbecue sauce both are to die for the beer selection is great and i enjoy the cocktails as well overall it is a great place for happy hour dinner or for hanging out and shooting pool my two best dude pals just got married on st pattys day in urbana and we headed here for the reception lunch charming interior prompt service and tasty eats holiday fate included irish stew corned beef cabbage rare bit irish soda bread and a platter of all of the above of course i opted for the platter to get a taste of everything corned beef and cabbage was nice spotted in the irish stew mmm rare bit basically cheese on toast was horrid soggy bread with fake melted cheese on it irish soda bread classic irish stew infused with lamb potatoes and veggies very nice on a cold windy day as for drink i had my usual strongbow they dont have it on tap just in a bottle eh next best thing cant stand the taste of it out of those yucky cans my favorite date spot in champaign they have a fantastic beer menu and a seasonal chef inspired menu their burgers are the best in town in my opinion and i am yet to have something here i didnt like staff is very knowledgeable at tentative friendly and helpful one of crane alleys best features is its diversity of atmosphere you can sit at the bar and enjoy shoot some pool with your friends or you can have a more private table in the back stories of the restaurant that are quite and comfortable for having a nice meal then during the warmer months you can sit outside on the sidewalk or in their quaint creatively decorated alley that is right next to the building hence the name crane alley the ambiance out there is top notch and i would highly recommend it any time the weather is nice i just really love this place the beer selection is fantastic the food is surprisingly good the service rarely disappoints and the ambience outside in the summer is awesome not much reason to drive to champaign to drink when i can walk to crane alley skip this place at all costs i went with a small group and the service was horrible we were seated after a long wait and then told that we could not order food because the kitchen was too small and had too many orders already in what kind of establishment tells customers who are seated and hungry that they cannot order food what a joke we asked for salsa and chips and were told that we could not order anything it took everything in our power not to walk out once we finally were able to order the staff and management stared at our table and could not wait to take our plates i was not even done and told the manager to leave my plate this place is ran poorly and needless to say our group wont be back there are many better places to eat in the cu area crane alley rocks drinks are are strong and the food is great we had the italian beef and reuben and both were solid the wait for a friday night wasnt too bad about a twenty minute wait for a table but we grabbed a drink and a couple seats at the bar while we waited atmosphere was lively and staff was great their desserts are now made in house and are pretty fantastic the mint cheesecake isnt heavy and is refreshing the cheesecake in general here is way better than the cheesecakes i could find in st louis seriously they seem to have a rotating thing of desserts but if you see the carrot cake get that too its a lot more delicate than what im used to this is a great place to come for a drink and a late night meal last night we had the poutine and a couple of flights with a friendly staff this is one of our regular urbana spots to visit octoberfest here is phenomenal this place is my main go to to drink great beer every single person on the wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the beers im always looking for a good recommendation and the draft list changes so often that i rarely have a hard time choosing something new the artichoke dip and the special nachos are a must excellent quality bar food plus the more elevated stuff is good too good sized beer menu definitely my favorite place in champaign urbana for outdoor dining and drinking my favorites turkey pita sweet potato fries whatever the special hamburger is while i was a student at uiuc it never crossed my mind to go here only after i graduated and moved away did i come to like beer and realize how many opportunities i had missed in champaignurbana so when i was in town visiting i finally had a chance to go here i thought the beer selection was good but i would have preferred more options on tap because im used to the higher cost of living in ann arbor the beer prices seemed reasonable especially for flights that said i expected them to be slightly lower since its urbana and not ann arbor the menu looked great i got the porter marinated steak and was really excited because everything about it sounded like exactly what i wanted the food was somewhat disappointing though i wouldnt say it was bad but it was a little bland and just didnt live up to my expectations if i come back id probably just get a burger or sandwich service was fine our waitress checked on us just enough and food came out in a reasonable amount of time id definitely stop here again if im in the area but i wouldnt be too upset if i couldnt i had the hanger steak in my years of life ive never been more dissapointed by a meal perhaps i shouldnt have gone to crane alley hungry the portion size for the beef was laughable at the suace was bland the side of asparagus was fine the garlic mashed potatoes were decently good my friends got sandwiches at half the cost and i was definitely envious my favorite part about dining out tonight was watching my friends eat their meals the burgers are typically good service has been variable unfortunately we decided to try one of their specials which was some nachos with steak ragout sauce and roasted jalapenos with a chipotle sauce sounded amazing but as it came it was just a big bowl of chips and barely any sauce it just seemed so plain and the ragout was just a dark mush of sauce that seemed like it came from a can nothing about it was special and this cost i asked the waitress for more sauce seeing that most of our chips were very bare and later when the bill came she had charged us for the additional sauce when telling her we ordered more sauce because the chips barely had any she said ill take off the charge jesus christ she was definitely rude and hostile unnecessarily if the kitchen messed up and didnt add enough sauce you dont really need to charge the customer either way crane alley isnt on my list of placed id check out again id rather check out farrens in champaign the recent service and food option was definitely not something id want to experience again thanks but no thanks crane great beer selection havent tried the whole menu but what i had was good enough service just so so for me pretty solid beer selection nice waitstaff average food once a month beer club meetings the menu certainly not what we expected we thought it was going to be bar food but it impressed instead for the price it was above average but not amazing service was great ambience is hip bar was nice with their selection of beer id go again a so so choice for food and drinks in urbana service has always been great that being said way over priced a small cup of chili and a smaller glass of wine cost and for warning if you like del monte chili in a can than this is your place to order it was super thick and smelled like dog food not going back anytime soon went here for a friends birthday gluten free options were awesome the gluten free calamari as better than i have ever had at most places and i have never had it gluten free before the coconut basil chicken i got was good the rice it came with could have used more flavoring but the sauce was delicious the buffalo chicken sandwich my friend got was amazing i took a bite and discovered the sauce was so unique and had a hint of ranch which was so good my other friend ordered a caesar salad which had homemade croutons made from a baguette and was extremely larger definitely coming back and getting that buffalo chicken sandwich lots of unique choices all the entrees sandwiches looked good everything about crane alley is excellent the beer selection is second to none in the state best bloody mary in town the chili is excellent the appetizers are fantastic ive had better hot wings but that doesnt knock my review down really looking forward to the annual crawfish boil in june i thought crane alley was my favorite restaurant its not i just had one exceptionally good time and the rest were more faithful representations crane alley offers certain dishes for a limited time the first time i came here it was the salmon burger and oh my god it was scrumptious it was like one of the most yummy things ive ever had i never saw it again i came back here i think three more times still yummy and then progressively less so i think two of my least favorite things that ive tried here and in my life time were their spaghetti and lamb meatballs which was laughably overpriced for how it tasted and their cuban sandwich the spaghetti dish was bland and mushy the lamb uninteresting it was a comforting meal but seriously disappointing for its price and for the standards to which i held crane it sort of tasted like chef boyardee i like chef boyardee i know guilty repugnant pleasure so im not saying i absolutely despised it just not great the cuban sandwich broke my heart it really did i was expecting a cuban like you know a pressed cuban sandwich like you know a cuban well it came on a sub not pressed and sliding around in its mayo not pressed not impressed id most definitely come back for the salmon burger though i used to really like to eat here but the menu never changes it has few vegetarian options and the quality is inconsistent they also stopped having onion rings which made me sad the service is usually quite good though and they have an awesome always changing beer list unfortunately it can be quite loud and crowded on weekend evenings so it is awkward place to try to go with a group of friends this is probably the best urbana bar classy good food and drinks to go around last time i tried the pesto chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries and it was pretty decent and filling the beer selection is excellent and i love the alley seating during the summer however their food is underwhelming the steak frittes are pretty much the only thing i actually enjoy on the menu who wouldnt love french fries w hangar stack and garlic parmesan butter psa avoid the wings they are the definition of awful i live miles away in springfield but often spend a week in urbana for work when im here for nights of those nights will be at crane alley between the amazing food and the huge drink selection im all in baby love the selection of draft beer super friendly wait staff even when theyre packed very knowledgable bartenders that can help you select the perfect beverage for your taste buds love the outdoor seating for enjoying a light breeze with a burger and a beer thanks for the good times yall came here expecting a lot but realized that i should have set my expectations a lot lower first off the beer is beer its not bad the selection is great mostly bottles so you cant go wrong there though the blind pig might be a better bet overall however the food oh the food i was disappointed it started with the appetizers not looking for something regular i decided to try the pretzel bites the only thing apt about the name was bites theyre large ish golfball sized baked pretzel dough problem is the pretzel dough wasnt baked today maybe not even yesterday they take the pre baked bites and put them in the microwave oven for a few minutes and bring them out if you eat them fast youll be okay but once they start to cool they get hard like very hard they come with cheese which is cheese nothing special about it the reality is that my appetizer experience and the lackadaisical attitude when i asked about the appetizer kind of turned me off i didnt really make it past the apps being a gastropub i expected a bit more like at least freshly prepared food out of this place when im sitting at a table my appetizer doesnt need to come out at mcdonalds speed if i wanted that id have gone to mickey ds do it right and live up to the gastropub name if youre eating and drinking this is the kind of place to walk away from great menu and great food however very pricey ordered small potato pancakes that were very tasty and martinis and my bill was plus tax and tip service was great but the experience was not worth will not go back anytime soon approaching on the one year anniversary of the day i decided to stop coming to crane alley and i have to confess i do not miss it one bit crane alley is the equivalent of playing crimes against humanity with your friends you go only to humor people but you are bored the entire time and hate yourself for doing it the staff is extremely rude and the food unimaginative back when i used to drink on an occasion there was a vibe i was looking for dark dive y with the option of smoking a cig in an alleyway where i could see the stars when i got that urge crane alley was one of the options when they put out the tables and the tiny lights are lit sitting in that alley traffic passing by its easy to forget the stress of the day the problems at the other end but booze is booze and as far as ca is concerned unless youre drinking off the tap which is a good option it dont come cheap i will say this drinking here is a different experience theres a sleazy undertone stuffs dirty bartenders and even the barbacks are rude dismissive and its not because they arent making tips leave your money on the bar and theyll just help themselves had it happen numerous times to me as a matter of fact one actually wrote in her tip on my credit card once i wouldnt spend the money on the food you can find a hundred different places near to have a better meal if youre just gnoshing to keep up with the liquor thats one thing but if you want a bite with a beer try everyones favorite farrens d all together if its what youre looking for ca fits the bill there are better places out there though wait staff is amazing the turkey pita and hummas plate is my jam ive seriously never had anything i didnt love and the beer flights are such a great deal loved this place in grad school and love it still went here last saturday to watch some football and baseball before a wedding we took our time and had quite a few awesome beers as always a great selection while i felt a lot of places in the area of decreased their selections crane alley has maintained one of the best selections in cu i got as always some buffalo wings delicious and the steak sandwich the sandwich was perfectly cooked and delicious bf got the pita pizza which he said was also awesome great beer selection delicious food great place to bring out of town guests usually how i ended my bar crawls great place in urbana for drinks and food especially when the weather is nice and you can sit outside in the alley definitely a solid place to go huge draft beer selection great fish sandwich great sweet potato fries nachoschili was soso will come back for backwoods bbq on went here on sunday for the annual founders cook out showed up shortly after and was in for a long long day of drinking and eating the event started at with the first special keg of kbs being tapped at arrived right at the initial pouring got one of these extremely rare beers we found friends in the upstairs mezzanine and talked a waitress into allowing us to move a table next to theirs even though there was a sign on the door that they wouldnt seat people until the full party had arrive what is this black dog as we got seated i ordered the steak at least a pound rare locally sourced foods cooked great i can live with that kridz ordered the pretzel bites food arrived promptly it doesnt take long to rare up a steak served with some delicious veggies and something else on the plate that i dont remember steak was awesome i was really in the mood for steak the pretzel bites were pretzely and bitey served with their cheese sauce made with dirty bastard i believe it went well with the founders theme there was founders schwag on the table we left it i dont really need anymore beer schwag and if i did id just call up a rep and ask for some as i finished my kbs i ordered an all day ipa because well i was going to be drinking all day as our friends left we migrated downstairs the bar was full so we sat by another friend who was playing pool our waitress that we had upstairs kept us for the whole day and was very attentive filling our waters and letting us know when the next tapping was coming up even when we were sitting at the bar the second special tapping hit at pm it was kbs the harsher bourbon notes that were more present in the newer model had muted it was a very nice sipper no serious alcohol burn either good notes of dark chocolate a little figgy and dark fruits think a little raisin on a nice base of beer it might come across as a little chalky but still a darn good beer after we moved to the bar by another friend we had asked what the deserts were there was a chocolate cake and a cheese cake i love cheese cake well our waitress overheard us talking and put one in i dont think we were ready for it but what the heck cheese cake showed up im not not going to eat it at this time just after i texted a buddy informing him of the event he loves kbs claims its his favorite beer but he couldnt come because his wife is a paramedic and she was on duty and he had the kid i told him cbs was being tapped at and that he had hours to find a babysitter i dont think he tried well i informed him that i planned on having a tab and with the addition of the cheese cake it was probably gonna be at we ordered the cbs its flavors were much sweeter as its been aged in bourbon then maple syrup barrels not quite as chalky good maple notes would go good with pancakes at this point someone down the bar had their food delivered they got the pork belly a friggin half pound of pork belly it looked like heaven i was tempted to order that as well i was seriously very close to ordering that as well its like a half pound of extremely tender bacon i somehow managed not to get that then we left come back next year oh went back on tuesday night and had another kbs then went back on wednesday for the beer club you dont know about beer club i want to love it but cant quite yet pros beer selection extensive tap and bottle list ive had the opportunity to try some great beers here including bcbs and kbs you can order flights of beer four ounce pours if you want to try several beers ingredients locally sourced food everything has always tasted fresh i enjoy the lunch half and half option with the garden salad and soup du jour the vinaigrette dressing is tasty cons price a little hefty compared to other restaurants in town a beer will typically cost a sandwich at lunch is around i would definitely recommend bar service if you have a small party service is much faster my brother and i had dinner at sitara just around the corner and decided to chat for a bit over a few drinks before he had to move on to other plans crane alley is quite an interesting establishment it is a proper restaurant but also serves quite well as a late night bar pool tables were getting good use before pm since we had already eaten we just needed drinks no issues with us taking up a table the drink menu is quite extensive impressive i am not a big drinker but they lambic bottles i got raspberry my brother got a few beers our bill was id like to stop by another time to try out their food folks around us seemed pretty happy with their food restaurant review i really wanted this place to have the best burgers in town but it fell short of that expectation we came here as a second option after we found out farrens was closed for lunch there was nobody here during the lunch hour which was nice because i could select that chicago bears game on the tv they did end up losing however i enjoyed my meal while watching them lose i was expecting more from their menu but i went with the war pig burger this has half a pound of meat bacon grilled ham and gorgonzola surprisingly even though there wasnt that many people at the restaurant it took quite a long time to prepare the lunch i was a little disappointed with the brioche bun as it was slightly crispy the burger patty itself lacked the strong meat flavor and was a little bit chewy however maybe its my fault because it came out medium instead of medium rare the fries were nothing exciting and i should have upgraded to the sweet potato fry i think ill go back to farrens next time im looking for a burger pros not too busy friendly service and lots of tvs cons the food quality is so so in the burgers are nothing special hidden deals there was no special deals i found health code rating b food appears to be prepared clean the report indicates the restaurantbar area could be cleaner http champaign il gegov comchampaignestab cfmfacilityid crane alley is a great place for an app a burger and a beer their spinach artichoke dip crab cakes and calamari are all very good starters i almost always get their portabella burger which is very good my partner loves their reubens and says that they are his favorite in town its a great place for friends to meet up or for a casual date in the summer their outdoor alley seating is wonderful and much preferable over their indoor seating stars instead of because of higher pricing for casual bar food the atmosphere here is very casual there are pool tables and it kinda has a bar vibe there were very few people there while i was while i really enjoyed the mezze plate i ordered i didnt think the price reflected the atmosphere and service over all there was no bread served my glass of water was constantly empty and the friend i had dinner with requested to have vegetables instead of mashed potatoes with her salmon and was immediately turned down for what she was paying you think the server would have made some attempt to replace the potatoes for another side again the food was good but i will not be back anytime soon they recently updated their menu and its great i had a greek salad and added salmon and my husband got chili mac and we both enjoyed our meals the beer selection is great and changes seasonally our server recommend a glass of wine and i took his recommendation which was a great choice we will be going back more often maybe the most underrated barrestaurant in all of cu granted the food can be hit or miss but for a bar the food is generally good as i have attended many work functions here i can attest that there is something for everyone on the menu aside from typical bar fare they often have unexpected items ragout nachos falafel a main draw for me is the beer selection always seasonal with a large number of taps they have many localish beers on tap from tryptich revolution two brothers etc you can even mix and match beers for a beer flight which is always a good gimmick excellent food but very uncomfortable seating requested a booth and got a hard plywood seat so it wasnt inviting enough to make me want to stay for an extended length of time this might be the only place in c u where they charge you a fee for bringing your own birthday cake which includes some plates and forks no song or any other special treatment beyond that still the food is really good so go but not for a birthday celebration if youre planning on bringing a cake large beer selection but subpar food waiter was great and acted like he cared ordered the pretzel bites and chips and salsa salsa was not great and has a tomato paste texture when we told the waiter we were not a fan he took the salsa off and gave us hummus and didnt charge us for it would recommend always a for food friendly staff great service and awesome atmosphere the war pig and sweet potato fries are my go to meal with one of the many excellent options from the beverage list which is quite extensive btw by far one of the best if not the best in town today st patricks day they had a st patricks day menu i had a moylans dragoon dry irish stout paired with their welsh rarebit perfect combo im rarely disappointed here the beer selection is nd to none not just in the area in the entire state the chili is always excellent and my favorite sandwich now is the buffalo chicken its perfect i dont need much of an excuse to go to crane alley its always a treat and with warmer weather sitting outside is even more reason to go i dont normally like falafel sandwiches but i love theirs they also serve delish hot pretzels with cheese good veggie pasta dishes and a yum vegetable sandwiches fun and interesting beer choices half acre now on tap always great service and priced right large beer selection flights daily specials good burgers pool tables its a pretty good place to meet hang out octoberfest is pretty great in the summer theres outdoor seating with strings of lights above in the alleyway between buildings easy downtown urbana location with parking nearby open late good place in downtown urbana for a bite flight open late billiards plenty of seating but can be loud outdoor seating in temperate weather flights are now for oz beers crane ally is a great spot for food and drinks great outdoor seating ive been here several times and the food is always good a ton of drinks to choose from the service is usually good but i have a had a couple sub par servers here but ill keep going back because its one of my favorites in cu came here for lunch with a friend and wasnt very impressed we ordered bloody marys which were very good and only ill take that we also ordered the bbq wings and the chili cheese fries neither were very good at all i understand that we arent exactly ordering delicacies here but ive never really met a wing that i didnt like until today the wings were sort of fatty and the sauce wasnt very good and also had kind of an odd consistency we ended up leaving a few we disliked them so much the chili cheese fries were edible but looked and tasted like something that your mom threw together for lunch when you were a kid just not very good however our server was very efficient and they have a really nice outdoor seating area one of my favorites in champaign urbana great spirits menu featuring a wide variety of beerale and wines pleasurable laid back environment makes this one a must do for happy hour or the occasional weekend drink i like to go to crane alley when i want to just relax and unwind with a glass in my hand and talk to good friends or maybe make a few new friends all food ive eaten here has been great no complaints will go back time and time again a strong recommend this is one of my go to places in downtown urbana great atmosphere and staff you cant go wrong whether youre heading to happy hour after work or if its date night with your significant other whats great about crane alley is the welcoming atmosphere inside and ample seating so you really never have to wait for a table one of my favorite parts is their outdoor seating in the alleyway dont worry its not a creepy alley its the perfect setup for the warm weather and when the lights are lit up at night its absolutely beautiful this is truly a place that has something for everyone their beer selection is always spot on and always has something new to try every visit their food is great especially their chilli and buffalo chicken sandwich bottom line no matter what the occasion this place will not disappoint it was a busy day i called the lady i usually see to get my fingernails pulled out but she was on vacation so i stopped by the guys place who pisses on your leg for and tells you its raining but he was at his urinalysis so i decided to just go to lacys the owner of lacys got arrested so i went next door to this godforsaken turd burglar commune to get my daily dose of guaranteed disappointment it was terrible like a french kiss with a flu stricken meth mouth wench after a garlic bagel breakfast the salads are shockingly barren of any of the advertised ingredients other than lettuce the falafel is akin to balled mashed potatoes and shares a similar sharpness of flavor the wait times times are what youd expect at a place that does live butchering to plate service the fucking chicken wings are breaded who does that this restaurant employs what i call urbana pricing where each item costs more than anyone would ever pay in a city with enough restaurants to compete with each other if there is a restaurant in champaign county with a worse menu as low quality food and as consistently bad service as crane alley please tell me about it i probably wouldnt go there ever again either definitely a staple for me when i lived in urbana the bar features a huge selection of craft beers and cocktails as well as pbr pints for the frugal drinker the atmosphere is fantastic weather permitting i always sit outside in the alley but the indoor seating has a pleasant relaxed ambience to it as far as the food goes you cant go wrong with any of their burgers they frequently feature creative specials that are worth exploring their half sandwich half soupsalad lunch deal is a good option if youre looking for something lighter if youre over in champaign waiting in line for one of the hot spots there you are missing out on this urbana gem just like the name says crane alley is in an alley i think thats the coolest thing sure they have a nice little interior space but its all about that alley yall im such a sucker for outdoor dining give me some exposed bricks and strings of lights overhead and im a happy boy its really beautiful the service was stellar everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful especially when navigating around a food allergy our drinks were constantly refilled but our server was never intrusive i heard the menu was recently revamped and i was impressed with all the comfortable choices crane alley wont win any awards for the most creative or inventive food but these traditional options are made with quality ingredients and lots of care this is a place i could easily come to often the food isnt so unique or expensive that you only want it every once in a while im not a beer drinker but i hear the selection is outstanding i most definitely recommend crane alley for a low key meal with friends or a romantic date with your boo chicken marsala always good and always consistent love the margaritas too}
{4460, McDonald's, 4750 E Warner Rd Phoenix AZ 85044, why stars its mcdonalds thats why its consistent but not great but we were all raised on this stuff so its hard to hate it this particular mcdonalds is clean and remodeled service is on the slower side and one time they totally drove me crazy by not accepting a mcdonalds coupon that i got in a pats run swag bag im grateful to have it in the neighborhood this is a nice clean location has dual drive thru lanes and is insanely fast i am very impressed with how efficient they are probably the nicest mcdonalds ive been in in a while staff is friendly place is spotless and on table has video games built into the counter for the kids pretty cool to say the employees here are rude would be putting it mildly i come here frequently not because it is the best mcdonalds but rather because it is the closest mcdonalds the food here is okay at best for a mcdonalds its certainly better than either location on chandler boulevard however my major complaint is that no matter what time of day i come or if i go drive through versus inside not a single employee thanks me for my business it especially irks me because as someone who has worked customer service i always make a point of thanking the people who are providing me the service i dont think its unreasonable to expect the same courtesy from people where i choose to spend my money thus providing them a job apart from the blatantly rude service this location seems to have a problem with employees never emptying trash cans especially at the drive through i cant count how many times ive come even in the morning and that trashcan is overflowing im not sure if its a problem for the health department or not but i can tell you that its really disgusting to see birds and flies hang around the trashcan right in front of where im picking up my food food and trash literally overflow its a similar case inside the restaurant especially at the cans near the bathroom overall this is an okay mcdonalds if you just need one thats close by but dont expect it to be a great mcdonalds this place was fancy decorated nicely even filled with video games to keep those screaming kids quiet food was super fresh they perfected my double cheesy burger tons of seasoning and diced onions my only complaint is that they put both slices of cheese in between the meat patties instead of the cheese meat cheese meat setup that every other mc donalds does clean bathrooms friendly service perfect rest stop i stopped on the way home tonight it was dinner hour and pretty empty in the dining room i think there were three customers in the dining area there wasnt a line but customers had to wait because the staff was more concerned about the schedule than the few customers that were waiting we werent even recognized as we stood waiting for service staff is loud ever see king burger video i think bon qui qui might work here inside is nicely decorated but few totally sterile you could probably just bring a hose in to clean it since there are few padded seats i will choose a different one next time mcdonalds has changed so much over the years its hard to recognized as a guy with kids ive been a frequent visitor to mcdonalds all around this great country ive kept a mental list of the best and worst mcdonalds weve visited congratulations are in order to this location for finally officially taking top spot from the maricopa location on john wayne pkwy as the worst mcdonalds in existence how fortunate am i to have a beautiful house in ahwatukee next to this pathetic and disgusting excuse for a fast food joint i have waited a year to give them an opportunity to improve or change managers but whatever is wrong here runs deep it is almost miraculous how standard mcdonalds fare can be prepared to taste this bad and be this unappealing despite the obvious attempts to provide equipment and product that makes it foolproof and consistent in order to keep my faith in humanity i must assume the staff is intentionally trying to undermine and destroy mcdonalds reputation normal human beings are likely incapable of this level of pure incompetence the lobby is layered in old food and filth the employees are angry and rude the orders are incomplete or wrong and everything takes for ev er while i sit here i hear two more people ask to speak to the manager dont bother weve done that too over the past year nothing will change and i hear employees arguing with each other and using foul language none of this is unique to this visit we are done with this location permanently and will take extra time and gas to cross i to a better location please do yourself a favor and do the same one of the slowest places ive been to do they know its supposed to be fast food they seem surprised when people show up to eat at for lunch they give you some lame excuse for your order taking so long such as waiting on fries and then when you get them theyre cold or they mess up your order and you have to wait even longer while they fix it maybe under new management they might do better but i dont know maybe mcdonalds has just given up slow service with remodeled location food was hot and all but the service was eh dont think ill stop by again i ordered large fries and they didnt fill them up to the top i feel like i paid for large but got small fries absolutely the slowest mcdonalds in town all four times this month i have had to wait minutes so much for fast food this place is awesome the only bad thing about it is management which is a big deal i complained to corporate today first time i ever do this and i felt bad about it but i had to i waited in the parking lot for min during lunch time after ordering through drive thru for some cheese sticks and a hot n spicy i was gonna be late to work so i decided to go in to ask for my food i am not the kind of person to complain so i wasnt going there with the intention of arguing just figure they forgot idk as i was walking in i ran into an employee who was bringing some food out and he asked me if i was waiting for fish i told him no and explain what i was waiting for i could see in his face he had given the wrong bag to someone else so i followed him to the register again i wasnt being rude i know people make mistakes all the time and he probably just got confused because it was lunch time and it was busy as he explained to the manager what happened she started yelling at him in from of everyone in front of other employees and customers that he had given the wrong food to someone else she wouldnt stop yelling at him and repeated the same thing a few times i could tell the poor boy was so embarrassed so i decided to step in and told the manager there was no need to yell at him that i could wait and that it was fine she rolled her eyes with no apology and turned her back at me and i could tell that she got embarrassed and really pissed old because i did the same thing to her as she did to him i am sorry but this is not the first time or the second that this manager has acted so rude towards me or other customers so i got her name and called corporate office this is no way to treat you coworkers you are no better than him or any other person that works there there has to be something done and i am gonna make sure something gets done i am not sorry for this angela manager you are a horrible person and i hope you learn your lesson and you know this is not the first time that someone has complained about you worst level of customer service ever simply walked in for a bag of ice wasnt greeted hello by anyone the male employee looked confused about my request he said he wasnt sure if we sold ice but the manager claudia assured him they did she also told me they had been having problems with the ice earlier that day and said it was to the extent that she had to run next store to get ice and that it would be awhile i didnt know why this was even being explained to me however it created confusion how long was this going to be minutes hour hours so my next question was how long it was going to take she seemed to take offense to my question i guess after giving me her business struggles claudia expects me the customer to stay in limbo with my ice request so minutes after a bag of ice was brought from the back to claudia who handed it to me i simply asked her for a bag to place it in so leak all over my car and she turned away from me and didnt answer or make me feel she had acknowledged my request for the bag so i repeated the request she rudely said im getting it and dont treat me that way i was blown away by her attitude and placed the bag on the counter and asked for my money back i asked for her name and she said you dont need to know my name this manager shoud clearly never be put in touch with the public who hired her for the position clearly baffling i will never return rob b stupid ass people i order my bacon mcdouble no bun not no meat they got the stickerlabel right but they didnt follow directions got home super hungry and my burger had no meat calling cooperate immediately first thing in the mornin}

{84439, Fatty Daddy's, 1608 N Miller Rd Ste 5 Scottsdale AZ 85257, best ice cream in the valley must visit the cookie cups are to die for give it a try home of the almost famous cookie cup instagram pictures dont do it justice the cookie cup is a giant chewy macaron with two scoops of ice cream toppings and additional locally made toasted marshmellow the ice cream is soft creamy and amazing we were recommended to get their cereal ice creams fruit loops captain crunch cinnamon toast crunch i loved it only thing i didnt like was the actual cereal bits because they got soggy but the flavor was spot on we ordered cinnamon toast crunch and green tea in a red velvet macaron with a toasted marshmellow for sharing is advisable because of size but id completely understand if you dont want to oh my goodness is this guilty sugar overload but i would be more than happy to come back over and over and over the store is small and kind of hidden away in the shopping plaza behind churchs chicken the owner was so sweet and helpful the grand opening will be hosted so keep you eyes out for the ads i highly recommend this place to everyone in the area i only hope for the best for this shop mmmm yumm was driving home when i saw fatty daddys sign for the first time this ice cream shop has ice cream in at least different flavors there are multiple toppings for you to choose from which includes their famous macaroon cup i sampled different ice cream flavors all of which were delicious i decided on peanut butter on a sugar cone i had been thinking to myself recently how it is unfortunate that there is not an ice cream shop in south scottsdale and now theres one right in my neighborhood im not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing i wonder if i walk to get ice cream will i burn all the calories that i will consume from the ice cream anyhow if you are looking to try something new swing by the staff is friendly cute dining area and outside seating i understand they will be having a grand opening this saturday on best ice cream in town they always have new and unique flavors every time i stop in the staff is very friendly and let you try as many flavors as you want but the cookie cup is by far my favorite you choose a macaroon bottom as many scoops of delicious ice cream in the middle and another macaroon on top i usually top mine with a toasted marshmallow i highly recommend this ice cream shop seriously good ice cream had unique and fun flavors like captain crunch cinnamon toast crunch and strawberry moscato i went with a cookie cup must get with papago peach beer and blueberry muffin it was amazeballs not sure if living across the street is a good or bad thing this place is so good they have a great combination of unique and original ice cream flavors everywhere from cap n crunch nutella and froot loops flavors to red velvet raspberry sorbet and vanilla i their famous cookie cup with banana and coconut ice cream with a coconut macaron they also roasted a marshmallow on top of it right before they handed it to me this place is as good as advertised absolutely fantastic ice cream its great to get such a great and authentic small business here in south

have tried every single flavor if there werent people in line behind me this place is amazing their flavors are unique and awesome i tried as many as i could and every one was so good nutella cinnamon

a scoop of peanut butter ice cream and a vanilla macaroon topped with a marshmallow they torch right before handing you your heaven in a cup honestly if youre an ice cream fanatic give this place a

yourself a favor and check this place out we found fatty daddy because of their smartly placed ice cream banner on the corner of miller almeria we checked the place out last night which coincidently was their grand opening even though theyre not likely to have food trucks and a dj on a regular night we will be back we had the blueberry muffin and thin mint ice cream flavors guess what they tasted like yup right on point guys really really luxe tasting ice cream base too cant wait to come back the grand opening was something special it was great to see the community get behind and support this

saw cups with flavors like movie night captain crunch cinnamon toast crunch grape pineapple and so many individual toppings i wanted to try all of their custom flavors but there wasnt enough time or room in my stomach the shakes that they were serving looked amazing and ill be trying one on my next visit while i create my next custom cookie cup if you love amazing and one of a kind flavors of ice

and hit the spot i will definitely be a returning customer husband and i checked out this place after reading about its opening the article doesnt do it justice the ice cream is on point and ill get to that but the customer service was top notch the guy at the counter took the time to explain each flavor and even let us sample each flavor i settled on the captain crunch ice cream which tasted

get and yelpers get check this place out its behind churchs they gave us many tastes to try super delish we got the soon to be famous cookie cup which had scoops of ice cream with a macaron and a toasted marshmallow i had raspberry sorbet and chocolate sorbet it was yummy my friend enjoyed hers too the struggle between keeping your new favorite dessert place a secret and posting a star review on yelp that it deserves i choose the star review there have been so many photos of the cookie cup from fatty daddys floating around yelp instagram facebook that i had to go in to try one as soon as possible first and foremost their ice cream when we were there we were told that they invent their own flavors and work with a local dairy to bring all their creations to life this is why they have unique flavors like fruit loops cap n crunch blueberry muffin netflix chill popcorn flavored infused ice cream with a bunch of stuff it etc next the cookie cup to make one they take up to two ice cream flavors of your choice and make a sandwich with a macaron the flavors of the macarons vary but the time we went they had fruity pebbles red velvet and vanilla they also toast up a marshmallow right in front of you and add any toppings to the cup that you may want my order was for a fruity pebbles macaron with blueberry muffin ice cream and a toasted marshmallow the best part about this whole dessert was that everything was put together in layers so there were bits of all three parts in every bite the macaron was soft and chewy with a smooth outer shell the blueberry muffin ice cream was packed with delicious blueberry flavor and the toasted marshmallow added another unique layer of flavor with a gooey texture yum lastly the service was spot on we were welcomed in right when we walked in and offered samples of ice cream they were great in making recommendations and were happy to give us the time we needed to make a decision even as it was getting busy i cant wait for the next time to get another cookie cup my friends and i have been talking about have visited fatty daddys officially our th time tonight is the first time we finally had the macaron cup sundae let me just say that it was definitely worth the wait because the times we came for the macarons cup sundae they were always out of macarons since they are made fresh and only last for days dont wait too long before you go to fatty daddys the location is hard to find but you wouldnt think to find it behind a churches chicken even though its at night there is no bright neon signs you can still find fatty daddys by the amount of people who are inside this little mom pop ice cream shop tonight i had the netflix chill ice cream which includes the chocolate covered pretzel and i went with the fruity pebble flavored macaron this is my new favorite all i can say is delicious my friend who likes chocolate had the nutella ice cream with the red velvet macaron a must try you will experience a chocolate lovers delight all macaron sundaes are topped off with a toasted marshmallow made directly in front of you fatty daddys is maybe a minute drive from east mesa but if you find yourself craving something sweet dont hesitate to come to this ice cream shop the decor is cute the staff is helpful super friendly you have over ice cream flavors to choose from and you cant go to fatty daddys and not try the macaron cup sundae theres the standard vanilla red velvet macaron every day but you also have the special macaron of the month which can vary from coconut to fruity pebbles theres also plenty of topping to choose from to add to your ice cream cones or sundaes but i like to keep mine simple so the toppings dont over power the main ingredients thanks fatty daddys for giving us a new twist on ice cream positive they let you sample as many flavors as you want the almost famous cup was good but if you have tried the ice cream and macaron sandwhich at pho they dont compare no marshmellow there but the quality of the macaron is much better this place is not worth going out of your way for but its still decent if i didnt have something better to compare it to i would have given stars great ice cream with unique flavors captain crunch is awesome also got a peanut butter chocolate bday cake banana shake all great and service was awesone stop by for some great dessert the ice cream was delicious they have different flavors and are willing to let you try them all until you are positive on your decision i got the fruity pebbles macaroons with capn crunch ice cream and a gourmet toasted marshmallow on top it is mock my words to die for ice cream is over priced and they advertise macaroons that they rarely have the location is very hidden so make sure you pay attention there isnt much signage what a find try the blueberry ice cream just like a blueberry muffin yummy also had the mocha java yaya and it was wonderful this place is fantastico the hubby and i wanted a little something sweet late at night and thank goodness this place is just in our neighborhood i had the captain crunch ice cream with a delicious toasted marshmallow on top this brought me back to my childhood days when we would make smores with the kids in our neighborhood my hubby had the chocolate gelato and peanut butter ice cream he was wowed on how great everything tastes the owner fat daddy was there and we complimented his idea and ice cream creations definitely coming back wish the outside parking was more lit up holy cow what a treat hidden behind churchs and bobs bikes i love good ice cream i heard from two separate people who know my weakness told me i had to try this new place i was not disappointed the cup is layers of cookies and ice cream a slice of heaven a must try great ice cream and service we really enjoyed coming here during our visit to scottsdale we will definitely be coming back youve never had ice cream until youve had a cookie cup a fatty daddys invention i mean listen to this ice cream macaron more ice cream another macaron and then oh wait a marshmallow what to top it off they bring out fire to toast that thing my mouth had no clue what the heck was going on but it wanted more of it make sure you get in when they have macarons but even if they dont try everything its a pleasant experience from start to finish brian is the nicest guy on the planet dom will make sure your experience is more than perfect and david can think of a great combination of ice cream on the fly from the moment you step into fatty daddys youll be welcomed with a welcome to fatty daddys from that moment on youre family so lets recap try everything get a cookie cup and leave feeling like family sounds like a great experience i know i had one and will be returning this place is the real deal super nice folks and their various cookie cup creations are just phenomenal i had mine with a macaroon cookie coconut ice cream butter pecan and the signature toasted marshmallow on top was simply amazing my friend had one with a vanilla cookie chocolate birthday cake ice cream cookies and cream hers was good but mine was the bomb great place you must check it out gotta say this place sure does have a great idea cereal ice cream cinnamon toast crunch ice cream seriously amazing whats any better than that ill tell u put in between fruity pebble macaroons yup a delicious ice cream cookie sandwhich so i had seen a bunch of posts about this place so clearly i needed to see what all the hype was about i was actually pretty impressed with the ideas behinds the ice cream flavors i had never seen ice cream flavor a derived from popular kid cereals cinnamon toast crunch fruit loops and cap n crunch pretty smart they also had some other delicious flavors i personally liked the white chocolate raspberry and mangoneada they are popular for their ice cream cookiemacaroon sandwhiches which they top off with a fire roasted marshmallow they have a variety of macaroons that are made specifically for them the location was a bit hard to find since it is tucked away and not easily visible from the street unfortunately after speaking with one of the owners they are not really permitted many options as far as signage by the city because of the direction the store entrance faces and rarity of their actual retail spot this can make it a bit difficult for some patrons but they are close to a park which will make them a popular summer spot once they get their name out more definitely check them out you wont be disappointed went in here a few days ago craving something new and delicious and that is exactly what i got i shared a cookie cup with my son and he loved it the macaroons are chewy which is one of the many reasons why the cookie cup is so mouthwatering the ice creams are creamy and delicious and come in fun and exciting new flavors that you wont find at your neighborhood cold stone not only is their ice cream amazing so is their service we met one of the owners and he welcomed us with a warm smile and let us taste test their marvelous flavors he was nice enough to answer the many questions i had about fat daddys even going as far as to tell me about how he and his business partners came across the darling table and chairs and the amazing artwork on their walls this will definitely be a place i take my friends and family when they visit from ca and i will be returning often for those fantastic cookie cups cereal flavored ice cream flavor along with traditional and unique sorbet get the luck of the irish this stuff will change your life really enjoyed the favors and the staff owner was there hes the real deal first time at fatty daddys and it was amazing they have all kinds of great flavors like cinnamon toast crunch blubbery muffin netflix and chill chocolate birthday cake and so many more the girls are super friendly and helpful and the owner brian was so friendly even gave us a sample of his new flavor with lucky charms great food and great people l loved this place great place loved the different selection of ice cream awesome variety great service and great ice cream the family had peach crumble vanilla bean banana and bubble gum the toasted a made from scratch marshmallow and it was devine we passed our bowls around trying to decide which one we liked the best service was very good and they let my daughters try out pretty much every flavor in the place we are actively trying to find excuses to come back to the area to eat here again i went because of all the great yelp reviews and the cookie cup with the macaroons they were out of the cookies told to come back thursday i still grabbed the ice cream but was disappointed with the quality of what i ordered and overall what i got out of it service was great though when we walked in we were greeted by super friendly and excited staff who told us we could try every flavor if we wanted all their ice cream is homemade and they get their macaroons special made from a local bakery deliveries come on thursdays we decided on a macaroon cookie bowl which i highly recommend getting the ice cream was probably the best i have ever had you can definitely tell it is homemade we decided on their lucky charm ice cream was crazy good and got the fruity pebble macaroon which was gooey and perfect in every way this would have been enough for me to be thrilled but then they put it over the top with a toasted marshmallow love love love this place rupert grints first ambition was to be an ice cream man and he bought an ice cream truck with the money he earned from harry potter movies one trip out to fatty daddys and im an instant fan linh l and i have been wanting to stop in after seeing chris h s drool worthy pics after a great st paddys day lunch we made the trek over only to find out that they were out of the delish macarons cookies what i threatened to drive my foot through the ice cream display case and told them tables were about to be flipped luckily it was delivery day for cookies and they made a call to see where they were itll take about mins for the cookies to get here cool so we decided to wait and time flew by as we got to taste almost all of the ice cream flavors and we sang along and made up new lyrics to hoziers take me to church after a brief wait they were here macarons i made a cookie cup out of fruity pebbles macarons with lucky charms ice cream added rainbow sprinkles for more color topped with a colored vanilla marshmallow did you know that the marshmallows comes from fluff it in gilbert made specifically for them with the colorful swirls the macarons are also specially made for them from twelve cake bakery the macarons are formulated and made to their liking so if you ever ordered from twelve cake bakery it wouldnt be the same which is truly a pity because its perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside as for that ice cream whoa everything i tried really tasted authentic to their flavor and the whole shebang isnt teeth rottingly sweet it was seriously perfect so yes the cookie cup is amazing the staff especially paco is so friendly and are full of laughter the shop itself is adorable with all their bold colors and fun artwork some even for sale i definitely will be back fatty daddys my skirt flips for that cookie cup note to self get the mangonada with chamoy yaaas awesome cookie cups with very different ice cream fla ors capitan crunch apple jacks mangoniada n as well as netflix n chill a must try when u come into fatty daddys everyone greats you with a big cheesy smile oh they let u try as many flavors as you like lol nice little hidden treat shop nestled around the corner behind the fitness business in the front of the building we had the cookie cup with mocha java lemon and also blueberry muffin ice cream flavors good prices and the kids were friendly that worked there we came in on a friday night and walked in with a crowd shortly behind us my boyfriend got just a scoop of the netflix and chill flavor and honestly it was not very good however i am a smart girl so i went for the cookie cup i chose the captain crunch ice cream and a red velvet macaroon it was so good my boyfriend ended up throwing his out and we shared the cookie cup he was not disappointed with my choice would definitely recommend popping in here try your flavor a first make sure its the right one for you ordered a cookie cup with blueberry muffin ice cream a fruity pebble macaroon and a toasted marshmallow on top was so freaking good wish i took a photo of all the crazy delicious flavors they had to offer wish i couldve tried them all too highly recommend fatty daddys i was craving ice cream and wanted to share a sundae with my bf before seeing a comedy show at stand up scottsdale and after seeing sugar bowl packed with line out the door i looked up places for ice cream and found this place i asked if they are able to make a sundae but then i found out about their famous cookie cup which is either a vanilla got it very sweet and delicious red velvet or something else which i cant remember macaroon cookie layered with two scoops of an ice cream flavor of your choice topped with another topping of your choice and another macaroon with a toasted marshmallow on top like a crown it was big enough to share with my bf and one of the best ice cream treats ive ever had i got it with vanilla macaroons and two scoops of cookie dough ice cream rainbow sprinkles and caramel sauce it was divine yum yum yum yum yum we came here after a show at scottsdale center for the arts i had searched for someplace new to go on yelp of course and came across fatty daddys it was on our way home and looked really interesting so i took my fiance there the decor is not much different than most indie ice creamgelato shops it was comfortable and friendly the staff was fantastic they answered our questions with smiles made recommendations and the man who we can only imagine was the owner came out to check and make sure everything was good after tasting a few flavors my fiance had the blueberry muffin ice cream with graham cracker crumbs and red velvet macaroons but does not like marshmallow so stopped there i was trying to stay non dairy so i had the chocolate sorbet with red velvet macaroons and a toasted marshmallow all i can say is we did not leave a single drop or crumb when the owner came out and asked my fiance how the ice cream was all my fiance could say was gone the ice cream is obviously freshly made daily as well as the macaroons they were very fresh the marshmallows were tasty too i cant wait to go back and try more flavors this is the first time weve stopped in at fatty daddys but based on the reviews and pictures we were intrigued the dessert with cookie and toasted marshmallow was the only special dessert item they were out of most flavors and the one they had that we thought looked good was not chocolate nutella was disappointing to the point that my wife and i threw it away its saying something if my wife throws away ice cream we stopped at a gas station for a pint of ben and jerrys it was much better again though our only time there and it was late the staff was friendly was in the hood and in the mood for ice cream saw fatty daddys pop up on a friends bookmarked list and was having dinner down the road worth a stop ice cream flavors here are cool lucky charms cherry amareto netflix and chill and on and on very creamy and the butterfat makes for a smooth spoonful the cookie cups looked amazing but we decided to skip since we were so full from dinner raincheck its a small shop with lots of staff and a good amount of sitting area it is on the backside of a shopping area off the major road though dont panic when your nav leads you around the corner seemingly away from where the shop should be its only yards away holy moly i was blown away haha this place is hard to find and is totally a hole in the wall youd have no idea theres an amazing ice cream shop in there i am a big fan of cute ice cream shops and sometimes i find ice cream places either are adorable and the ice cream is just ok or ok atmosphere but great ice cream fatty daddys has both the decor is cute and trendy we enjoyed our ice cream next to a huge picture of steve urkel also enjoying some ice cream they have the ice cream nicely on display and have unique flavors that all sounded amazing lots of cereal related ones i tried cinnamon toast crunch and lucky charms but decided on lucky charms soooo good the best part of that cereal plus ice cream i couldnt say no to that my sister and i got it as the little sundae with vanilla macaroons and a toasted marshmallow and shared it i usually am a big eater and can eat anything no matter how much there is but my sister and i together didnt even finish it because it was so rich it was delicious glad we shared it though haha used my yelp check in too and saved some money haha only complaint my sisters friend got a mint chip scoop and there was like two chips in the whole cone a little disappointing for her but she did like the ice cream otherwise amazing and ive found a new favorite this place is brand new and me and a friend decided t check it out on a tuesday at pm they were all so helpful and willing to let us try all the flavors some of the flavors were kind of weird and disappointing such as netflix and chill but their cookies and cream was amaze balls also they were out of macaroons so couldnt try the cookie ice cream thing that they do bummer cool place though first time here and this ice cream is really good staff is very friendly and very clean the girl helping me washed her hands after touching anything that wasnt sanitary very welcoming and let me sample anything i wanted to try afterwards i got a really cool ice cream with the cookie and marshmallow definitely will be coming back saw a bunch of my friends posting about fatty daddys and had a late night craving for some ice cream so here i go we got there right around closing time but service was still excellent and they let us sample some flavors originally wanted banana but after trying the lucky charms we were hooked was recommended to pair it with a fruity pebbles macaron and i was in heaven ice cream had some unique flavors and was very rich and creamy the macaron was also perfect not hard but still nice and chewy would love to go back and try some other flavors they gave me a stamp card with some extra stamps on it so ill definitely be back awsome customer service love the the french macaroon they let u try ice cream and r not rude about it i would not call this place a hole in the wall they are in a hard to find location though their flavors hit your taste buds with full force a charming setup in my opinion go try it you will not regret it or maybe you will because you will want to go often this place was awesome fatty daddy has unique ice cream flavors and all of them are tasty many of their flavors have cereal in them i got a cookie cup with red velvet cookies and honey smack and peanut butter ice cream it also came with a roasted marshmallow on top that was warm and gooey my husband got mint and chip and peanut butter ice cream on a sugar come and it was good but he regretted not getting the cookie cup after trying some of mine they are new and a little hard to find at night they dont have any lighted signs but his is because of the strict city rules they had friendly service and the owner even came out to talk to us for a bit absolutely amazing the cookie cup with the toasted mallow go perfectly together with their ice cream wow amazing ice cream get the cookie cup worth every dollar will definately come back delish ok this place was a treat we are talking the best macaroons i have had like ever and i go out of my way to try them when i find a place that sells them if you go here try a couple of their crazy flavors like captain crunch or the popcorn ice cream then order a cookie cup they will let use a couple flavors in it a macaron ice cream sandwich with a fluff it marshmallow on top yes please there are so many options too including some very unique ones such as fruity pebbles macarons and netflix and chill ice cream the cookie cup consists of two large macarons of your choice they had strawberry vanilla fruity pebbles and red velvet when i was here four scoops of ice cream with a marshmallow that is bruleed with a torch in front of you we got ours with fruity pebbles and red velvet macarons blueberry muffin and white chocolate raspberry ice cream the entire cup was a beautiful sugary sight to behold we dug in with gusto i loved the chewy texture of the macaron with the creamy smooth ice cream and fluffy pillowy marshmallow with caramelized crust we were definitely satisfied and full after sharing it the cost was pre tax service was very friendly and warm and everyone seemed very happy to be working here i would be too if i were surrounded with all this delicious bounty the location is definitely a bit odd as its hidden in the back of a shopping plaza right next to a residential area thanks to yelp though we were able to indulge in a unique and tasty collaborative dessert we probably wouldnt have been able to see from the street ill definitely be back again for more delicious dessert this place is awesome get the cookie cup delicious ice cream sandwiched between macaroons awesome all can say is this place is legit and the staff are as friendly as they come good job fat daddys this place is so good very unique twist on ice cream i would go here everyday if i lived closer macaroons are so good and the toasted marshmallow on top will make you whip and nay nay like nobodys watching dang this place is good go here go here quick and try everything haha the place is small but clean and cute with old looking vintage ice team parlor type chairs they are friendly and helpful with explaining flavors and letting you try them the flavors themselves are interesting and the names are catchy i had a flavor called netflix and chill hilarious it was a slightly savory and sweet buttery flavor with mms chocolate covered pretzels and a bunch if other delicious flavors it was super creamy and amazing they have add ins as well as macarons and amazing looking marshmallows that they can torch on too of your ice cream genius i was able to buy a whole pint to take home and share with my hubby i cant wait to go back and get more flavors absolutely amazing i really hope they decide to open a location in queen creek we really need an ice cream parlor out here i love everything about macarons so when this place opened up i had to give it a try they usually offer different flavors of macaron that is made locally if youre on the west side she makes macarons and ice cream macaron that you can get a pho then you pick any flavor ice cream you want the staff lets you sample the different ice creams if youre not sure what to get then you have the option to top your ice cream with a homemade marshmallow courtesy of fluff it marshmallow and they roast it right in front of you i would definitely recommend getting the roasted marshmallow on top makes the dessert taste better tonight was my first time coming here and it was great the people working the counter were very friendly and very willing to help you figure out what you might like also the ice cream flavors are crazy ive never seen them before but they were awesome they atmosphere was very cool as well with all the bright colors and the paintings on the wall i would definitely recommend this place and will be going back for sure delectable range of flavors that are as fun to dream about im looking at you netflix chill as they are delicious im fearful of how dangerously close it is to my house and that ill soon become fatty daddys lesser known cousin roly poly kristy fun and friendly team will be back this place is awesome great ice cream they even have cereal flavors and those are bomb if you love cereal paco has a great personality and made our experience great super nice and great service cant wait to come back two words cookie cup the cookie cup is composed of two macaron cookies sandwiching two scoops of ice cream and topped with a roasted marshmallow you can choose two different flavored ice cream for the two scoops if youre feeling adventurous you can add on the first topping for and each additional topping for the toppings are graham crackers oreos rainbow sprinkles chocolate sprinkles to name a few the workers were friendly and easy going being an extremely indecisive person i did not feel rushed to pick a flavor right away they were really willing to have me sample all ice cream flavors since there was no line behind me i tried only two flavors and fell in love with the mocha java yaya and mint chip i was cracking up at some of the names for the ice cream such as netflix chill i would definitely try a couple of samples while having fun at it the best part was seeing the marshmallow roasted by a torch right before our eyes if youre looking for something lighter they also have scoops of ice cream available this place did not quite get the five stars for me because of the price and sweetness the first couple of bites into the cookie cup was out of this world amazing however the subsequent bites were truly sweetness overload its also treading on the pricey side for the cup i have eaten larger macaron ice cream sandwiches with great flavors for only overall this place is great for kids there is a complimentary water station by the napkins if youre planning to eat your dessert on site there are a handful of tables inside and a couple of tables outside remember to check in on yelp for off your order they also have a stamp card buy scoops of ice cream and get the th scoop free please tell me they have a cot in the back room so i can move in amazing ice cream you have to get the cookie cup or you will regret it for the rest of your life super yummy great flavorful ice cream so many unique flavors to chose from the macaron is soft and fresh with intense flavor friendly faces behind the counter too omg if you like ice cream this place is a must read the about us on the website fantastic excellent i got the coconut and peanut butter creamy and tasty service was outstanding we were looking for a fun new dessert place so naturally i turned to yelp the stars certainly intrigued me so off we went its located in a little quiet strip mall but dont let that fool you its super clean and colorful inside and has a very welcoming atmosphere the owner was incredibly helpful and nice along with his staff they were truly excited to have us there and even more so they were excited about their product which is huge they have some of the most amazing flavors ive ever seen for ice cream lucky charms chocolate birthday cake captain crunch to name a few my daughter and i each got their almost famous but soon to be actually famous cookie cup which had two homemade macaroons perfectly cooked with three scoops of whatever ice cream you want topped with a toasted marshmallow ummm yum my daughter got fruity pebbles flavored macaroons with captain crunch ice cream the ice cream tastes just like the milk from a bowl of captain crunch along with pieces of the cereal in it i got vanilla macaroons with mint chocolate chip ice cream both creations were amazing my husband got a rocky road milkshake that he said was really good he was a little disappointed they didnt have plain chocolate ice cream but he admitted the rocky road was delicious we will be heading here again i love seeing new businesses succeed and excel at what they do so many yummy options you cant go wrong great service great place just stopped here for a night in scottsdale while driving across the county and was craving some ice cream so i did a search on yelp for ice cream and found this place and i couldnt not have picked a better place the ice cream was amazing i got the cookie cup which is a must for any first time visitor if your looking for quality ice cream dont go any where else but fatty daddys you will not be disappointed although i must admit that the ice cream flavors here are unique and good it is a bit pricey especially the famous cookie cup roasted marshmallow on top of macarons and scoops of ice cream this place is amazing if you go its worth spending the on their almost famous cookie cup specifically the cookie cup is your choice of a unique flavored ice cream ive done the netflix and chill which is popcorn butter flavored sweet ice cream chocolate pretzels layered with a delicious soft and chewy macaron cookie topped with more ice cream another macaron and then a marshmallow place don top which they toast right in front of you weve also tried the delicious lucky charms ice cream and the amaretto ice cream all have been amazing the pictures really speak for themselves not though the place is unassuming and hidden away in the corner of a parking lot by a paint store my applemaps took me a bit to find the place but the treasure at the end of it is delicious and worth it kudos i wish the ice cream choices were less watery i was so confused cause this place had five stars on yelp first time at fatty daddys and even though its a minute drive from my house it probably wont be my last the two girls working were really nice and kept giving me sample after sample of the ice creams they recommended which all were really good then after picking my flavors which were the banana captain crunch and morning something i forgot the name of the last one they got my macaroon and marshmallow on top then torch the marshmallow a bit and it was ready definitely coming back so friendly and so patient as my husband wanted to sample about eight flavors before settling on one i ordered the cookie cup cherry ice cream almond macaron the marshmallow was heavenly i recommend getting one scoop and adding a marshmallow as the cookie cup was way too much ice cream kind of difficult to find but totally worth it this hole in the wall ice cream shop is fresh and gorgeous the store is lined with gorgeous art prints for sale try purple rain formerly known as blueberry muffin it is far away from me but definitely worth the drive its right behind churches chicken its hidden near the back limited seats very small inside yessssss steve urkel picture was everything haha i had the red velvet macaroon with mocha java and mint chocolate chip ice cream in between and a square marshmallow on top whoooooooo bombbbb ohh try the foot loop and the lucky charm as well amazing great price and delicious ice cream and toppings you can really tell the people who work not only take pride in their business but really love their job and their customers hidden gem been here several times and never disappointed one word go bottom line customer service is great icecream is terrible the icecream was the worst i have ever had in my life it had no flavor and was soo icy it was basically ice tried different flavors and they all tasted very artificial very disappointed as i was excited to try this place i think they have the macaroons and the marshmallow to mask the terrible ice that they are selling i would not recommend it great and unique concept this place is worth trying but i thought the flavors of the ice creams and macarons were just ok overall though a for effort lots of potential red velvet anything french macarons and toasted marshmallow are basically in my personal book for favorite desserts so when i saw that this place has all in one convenient cup i knew i had to have it i got a bowl with passion fruit ice cream with purple rain blueberry muffin with a red velvet macaron topped with not one but two toasted marshmallows the guy who scooped it said he had never stacked two toasted marshmallows before but i saw in his heart that he had potential to be a jenga world champion and he did not disappoint both the passion fruit and blueberry muffin ice cream were great but the perfect bite to me was a spoonful of the chewy macaron with some gooey marshmallow and blueberry muffin ice cream followed by the passion fruit for some contrast its amazing really great place with nice people and especially excellent sweets i love the energy and the customer service at fatty daddys we arrived about minutes to closing ooops with a group of eight the staff were stoked even if they were anxious to get out and enjoy their evening i would have never known i would estimate each of us sampled at least three different flavors before choosing our options the selection is great and if you skip on the toasted marshmallow then youre missing out my only piece of advice i ordered the morning madness and the nutella flavor the vanilla scoop was placed on the bottom of the cup rather than on top of my nutella waahhhhhh it was a rookie mistake but vanilla goes on the top ill certainly be returning the kids here were extremely friendly and even encouraged us to try each flavor what a nice change of service service opposed to the typical ice cream parlor attitude ice cream was good and is average price we will be back after a long night of laying pipeno glove was used i worked up an appetite so after walking for about miles and drinking a couple s of md i felt like a ten year old slumdog living under a tattered canvas sheet in the bowels of urban philippines holds onto a spat out jolly rancher found on the street while pickpocketing tourists and giving high five to the locals fatty daddys employees scooped my ice cream took my money and i blacked out will be coming back for more went here last night for some dessert i found out about them on yelp the cookie cup with the macaroon cookie was delicious they had so many flavor a to pick from the only thing i did not like was that the names of their ice creams were very odd and so the names were not self explanatory i got the morning mess which was a combinations of cereals i got it with the red velvet macaroons it was a lot of ice cream and only like or working at coldstone in the past this place was pretty cheap and the customer service was great they didnt have enough thawed out morning mess so the guy filled my cup up with another ice cream i asked for but he proceeded to also give me a little cup of what they had in their freezer he said it was too frozen to put on my cookie cup cookie cup was amazing i am not a big ice cream fan but this was so good i polished off the whole thing will definitely go back again place is kinda out of the way so tell all your friends about it i hope this place is around for the next years gentleman running it was so nice allowing you to sample the ice cream flavors before ordering visiting scottsdale and wanted something yummy for dessert looked on yelp and found this amazing place i had the white chocolate raspberry and strawberry cheesecake ice cream in my cookie cup i chose the coconut macaroons and it was topped off with a warm marshmallow it was delicious and highly recommend they opened months ago and its a great find such a hidden gem they have super creative flavors the lucky charms was amazing staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming that toasted marshmallow is the most beautiful think ive ever saw and it tasted great im rating it stars just for that beautiful toasted marshmallow remember you can get the marshmallow without the cookie cup the cookie cup so good the variety of their ice cream is great too lots of interesting flavors and even the regular flavors have a unique and great taste to them this place is so adorable and great the customer service was so fantastic i had mentioned i was allergic to bananas and they mixed my ice cream with new scoops on a clean surface me and my best friend came here to satisfy our sweet tooths and we were not disappointed i especially loved the finishing touch of the torch roasted marshmallow on top of our deserts this place is awesome the ice cream flavors are creative and delicious everyone is so friendly and they are really passionate about their product they encourage you to sample every one if you have a craving for ice cream this is the spot best ice cream they have a variety of such unique flavors the flavor names are sure to make you laugh too and endless combinations especially with their cookie cup option my personal favorite might be the mangoneada but i almost always end up picking something else because they all taste so good i love that the decor is fresh and inviting and theyre open pretty late with friendly service so thats a plus all in all its a great place to satisfy my sweet tooth craving ill definitely be back in for more cute little place tucked away in a small strip mall delicious ice cream and macaroons loved the netflix and chill flavor definitely a new go to place for a yummy dessert capt crunch ice cream with a toasted mallow was id definitely recommend this place if youre looking for a unique ice cream joint wow just amazing ive been dying to try this place since everybody keeps talking about it all the hype is real the service was amazing franciso helped us pick we were very indecisive go figure but he was patient and answered any questions needed a variety of different flavors and your choice of macaroon followed by a toasted marshmallow i swear i was in heaven i love it and i will be back thats a promise best ice cream in scottsdale i love this local ice cream joint their staff is so friendly gave me extra stamps on my punch card and the toasted marshmallow on top is such an added treat wow ive been here about times in weeks doesnt help that we took all the kids the first time and now the oldest literally asks every night if we can go back the flavors are amazing the first night i had the white chocolate raspberry and the coffee flavor i forget now what they call it exactly they were terrific the flavors are very strong and taste real the coffee tasted like a terrific cup of coffee with cream and sugar and the raspberry was a strong natural taste while the white chocolate did not over power the rest my husband had the watermelon sorbet and it tasted just like taking a fresh slice of watermelon out of the freezer the second time i had a homemade roasted marshmallow on top of my sundae and it was divine the smell is a little intense at first with the burning sugar but the flavor was terrific i would highly recommend seeking out this tiny gem they have standard flavors as well as creative ones my favorite name so far is the netflix and chill ive met both owners and they really seem to enjoy what they do and the people they meet this place is really good it took me awhile to find but i did find the place the parking lot is much to be desiered the place is small but decent they were extremely friendly and helpfull in letting me make a choice on what i wanted i ended up getting cookies and cream with a red velvet macaron and a toasted marshmellow yum ive never had a macaron before so this was my first time and i loved it the toasted marshmellow was to die for the outter shell it made and breaking it open to find the gooey fluff just ooze out ugh perfection i could have had of those on my ice cream and i would have been good to go i will say they are a bit expensive mine came out to which the ice cream was good but i dont think its good enough for its worth a shot and make sure you use your check in offer it was pretty good i had a mangoneada and it was a nice combo of sweet and spicy my big negative is the prices i think they are just too high for an ice cream place for two scoops sheesh i honestly dont think ill return and thats unfortunate because their cookie cup looks good i have been wanting to try this place forever and it did not dissapoint its located in the back with a dirt lot which made it hard to find at first but i appreciate all the parking we went inside and immediately we were greeted warmly and with excitement they gave us a walk through about their flavors and some of their specialties i did the one scoop with toasted marshmallow and a macaron on top first of all i love smores i love ice cream and i especially love macarons this was a beautiful marriage of everything i loved in on concoction it was original but a twist on the classic the urkel ice cream was my favorite because peanut butter and chocolate just belong together the decor is awesome because the art is so unique i mean i think i need a giant picture of urkel licking ice cream in my house now the chairs were comfortable and i love the blend of colors overall i love this place such an awesome addition to scottsdale that has its own unique flair very good but a small portion for the cost of it i order a large which was and it was more like a medium and i would price more like best ice cream ever i come here at least once a week for their cookie cup and it never disappoints staff is super friendly and encourages you to try as many flavors as you want ive never tried the shakes but my dad always gets the strawberry and swears its the best hes had good location and fantastic ice cream not possibly real ice cream had texture of vegetable oil i do not understand why there are so many great reviews i sampled six flavors and each had a mealy oily texture went with strawberry cheesecake because i thought how can u mess that one up nope same horrible texture this place was absolutely terrific my sister had seen them on social media and so we thought we would give it a try as soon as we walked in we were warmly greeted by the friendly workers who were more than willing to answer my never ending questions they were eager to let us try as many flavors as we wanted and they were super helpful in making the final ice cream decision i would most definitely recommend this place to anyone who is an ice cream lover a lot of great flavors to choose from and the staff is more than happy to let you try as many as youd like the location isnt the greatest but there is a fair amount of parking i went with the cookie cup red velvet macarons capn crunch and cookies cream ice creams this thing is beastly would highly recommend and will defintely be back again very soon im giving this stars but the person who paid for me may give it less the ice cream cookie marsh mallow combo is absolutely genius slightly expensive but honestly its pretty unique and innovative so its worth the extra few bucks great ice cream its not like mind blowing but still really good it was super cute how they presented it too extremely friendly and welcoming staff happy to support a local business that has such great people working there ill definitely come again ive had this ice cream place bookmarked ever since it opened since i bookmarked it my son daughter and mother have been here multiple times bring all their friends so i finally made it out here on the weekend with my family of course they all had to come everyone warned me that its really hidden and they arent kidding its in the back of some strip mall with a pretty big parking lot but its not even lit up dark we walked in and we have two friendly faces just standing there and welcoming us to fatty daddys everyones getting all these samples cause they looked so good i just got their cookies and cream ice cream as a mini daddys cookie cup so you get one scoop of ice cream with a macaroon on top to top this off is got the marshmallow and they torch it to be nice and crispy it was so darn good i got the red velvet macaroon everything went so well together everything was fresh and creamy yummy yummy my daughter and mom never got the cookie cup before and followed my lead they all love it my son of course had to get the fatty daddy cookie cup which has two scoops with a macaroon in between and on top of the cup with of course an added marshmallow that is a must they have seating inside and outside to enjoy this little treat it just seems like there is a stream of people always coming in non stop for a hidden gem everyone knows about this place they have friendly service with so many options for the cookie cup fresh creamy and down right good of course ill be back to try another flavor but not too often cause that would mean the gym everyday just glad its on the other side of town so i can control myself enjoy very small portions of ice cream for the i spent cereal was very soggy in the ice cream so idk its a good idea but dont turn out too good ill stick to cold stone place is a great new addition to the area flavors are inventive and unique definitely need to get a fatty daddy two gigantic macaroons sandwich incredibly delectable hand crafted ice cream check email out i think im in the minority by rating this place stars i also feel like my friends will disown me once they find out because somehow its becoming a tradition for them to go to ahi poke bowl and then fatty daddys dont ask im not sure how it happened anyway back to fatty daddys ive come here twice and i feel like these are the moments when i wish a star was possible yes the fatty daddy cup has all the wonderful ingredients up to two flavors of ice cream two layers of macarons and one toasted marshmallow but in my opinion the toasted marshmallow makes it hard to eat also the macaron was a little crispierharder the first time i went however it had the chewy consistency the second time as far as the ice cream itself im not a fan of all the cereal ones they have with the cereal pieces in the ice cream they seem stalesoggy when its in my cup i dont know it just doesnt quite work for me pluses of this place are the customer service and the loyalty points system the guys and gal ive only seen one so far are always super friendly you can try as many flavors as you want they also have a loyalty program for better or for worse where you can earn scoops to a cup depending on how many points you have at your chosen time of redemption so thats pretty nifty these aspects are ones that makes me feel like this place is more of a stars a little difficult location to find but once we arrive we knew it would be a great time the flavors of ice cream are amazing and theres a great variety we went with mini daddys and still left satisfied the price is reasonable for this decadent and clinically insane dessert and shows for a great treat during summer leaving very happy this place is really fun its tucked away in a little strip center i dont know what you call it that doesnt look like it would contain an icecream shop so you have to keep sharp eyes out to spot it for non dairy eaters like me they have a surprising amount of options the day i went they had dairy free sorbets that were so delicious i ended up getting half passionberry and half strawberry moscato yum the coconut macaron on top was sooo sweet but in a good way i liked how the outside of the macaron was crispy and the inside was a bit gooey the torched marshmallow on top put this dessert over the top there is little more that i love in this world than toasted marshmallow ill definitely be back for more sweet treats i have to update my last review the last review was when they were completely out of cookies and low on ice cream i went today and oh my so delicious and i cant wait to go back and share the experience i ordered captain crunch ice cream a fruity pebbles macaroon and toasted marshmallow delicious wife and i just stopped by awesome food great price and friendly staff highly recommended hands down the best ice cream shop ive been to they have tons of unique ice cream flavors soft macarons and top off your creation with a toasted marshmallow the guy who helped us out i forgot to get his name was super friendly and more than happy to let us try any flavor we wanted my husband and i will definitely be making this our regular dessert place the owner helped us and he was so nice and helpful awesome guy the ice cream flavors are delicious and super creative and he lets you try as many as you want i had the almond macaron and it was awesome loved the peanut butter ice cream too fun little spot with friendly help a little hard to find so keep an eye for a carls jr its right behind it next to a paint shop it doesnt look like theres something there but once you find it youll have the best macaroon and ice cream sandwich ever not to mention the service which is awesome loved it the location is their biggest struggle but the execution of delicious desserts is spot on started following hem on social media and all their concoctions look too notch its slightly tucked away in a small pointless shopping enter with bad signage but that must be overcome so your mouth and tummy can get a taste of whats going on here didnt taste anything just dove straight in went with the urkkelsp anything related to family matters circa is a must try it was perfect added a fruity pebble macaroon which wasnt my first choice but they were out of the caramel they threw on a toasted marshmallow that they bruleed right there and i was off to dessert nirvana my counterpart went with a small scoop of netfix and chill we both voted mine to be the champ but her popcorn treat was different and fun a hole in the wall location serving up unique flavors of ice cream and sorbets i had the morning mess and had a fruity pebbles macaron on top of that awesome sauce we decided to check this place out one evening and we are really glad that we did the cookie cup was delicious lucky charms ice cream does it get any better and the service was great im sold on their innovative blending of macarons ice cream and a toasted marshmallow we will be back for sure the hubs and i finally decided to stop in and try this place as ice cream in this hellacious hot weather sounded fantastic we were not disappointed we shared the mini daddy consisting of a scoop of fudgesicle a scoop of nutella a caramel macaron and a large toasted marshmallow heaven its within walking distance of our home yay we will be back im obsessed dessert is my absolute favorite in fact ive been told i have sweet teeth as opposed to a sweet tooth so when my boyfriend told me theres a new spot by his place that serves ice cream with macaroon cookies and a toasted marshmallow i was counting down until my next visit to scottsdale feeling the inner kiddy in me i had the captain crunch ice cream with a fruity pebbles macaroon and was in sugary yummy heaven its a little pricey even by my la standard think gelato prices but i think its worth it for the occasional treat ps if you skip the toasted homemade marshmallow youre a devilish monster not a big dessert person but the macaroon sandwiches are quite good i only tried the rich flavors but they all seemed very good the cereal flavors are good as well but they contain actual pieces of cereal that are a little soggy i didnt mind but my friends did not like the texture you also get marshmallow but i felt it didnt really fit in this is a small store so dont expect seating during the busy hours you just might have to eat it outside or in the comfort of your car the people working there are also very nice and patient when i went my group was just tasting flavors for a couple of minutes i would give these guys a higher rating but the pricing is a little too high for a couple scoops and a macaroon awesome ice cream and the mini fatty daddy is just enough of an indulgence without being too sweet the netflix and chill is the perfect combo of salty and sweet ice cream and the macaron and toasted marshmallow are an awesome addition definitely a must try took a while to find its hidden and it would be helpful to have a little more sign other than on the door the toasted marshmallow was heaven and the coconut macaron was even more delicious than the marshmallow i tried the fudgesicle ice cream and it wasnt great but i cant wait to try more flavor a we will totally be back for more what a creative delicious little place awesome customer service and great ice cream with cookies and marshmallow i got a mini daddy and it was great love we ordered mini daddys and it was perfect everything was fresh and delicious will definitely be a repeat customer so delicious get the cookie cup or youre not doing it right the owner is awesome a d flavors change at least once a week all employees friendly and knowledgable awesome and tasty so much better than the national chains this place is fantastic you wont find these snacks and flavors anywhere else the macarons are fresh and chewy with a crispy exterior the red velvet is a fav be sure to get a cookie cup which has your favorite flavor smooshed between macarons and topped with a homemade marshmallow charred to order my pals named the netflix chill which you have to try basically all of your movie night snacks in one ice cream salty and sweet you cant lose with lucky charms breakfast cereals blueberry muffin or berry moscato this place is serious fatty daddys is a small shop in a quiet plaza im from philadelphia and this would be such a gem with lines wrapped around if it were in the city really fun ice cream flavors and all very yummy the staff were really friendly and helpful in explaining the flavors and giving my friends and i samples i got a fatty daddys and it was so good lucky charms ice cream fruity pebbles macaron and a perfectly toasted marshmallow check in on yelp for off totally worth the price cool concept good customer service delicious desserts delicious what a unique combination with the macroon and toasted marshmallow definitely putting this on our favorites list my first time here and i had to start with the mini daddy it comes with a macaroon cookie almond flour a torched marshmellow and ice cream i tried flavors and they were all good some creative flavors here along with the classics most importantly it has the one thing every ice cream pace needs water for after the ice cream of course really like that detail cool idea behind it good flavor ice creams and sorbets the red velvet macaroon was ok not that tasty but pretty it would be nicer to add more flavors to the selection they have a hidden location but their cool idea and quality drag people here with help of yelp fudge creation was a dream best i ever tasted was tucked in almost missed it could use a small billboard sign that you take in at night to let passerbys know that you are there we almost passed it up but were determined to have a treat great ice cream some creative flavors some good some eh amazing ive only had this once while visiting in arizona but im still thinking about my foodsperience super friendly staff unlimited samples until you find the perfect ice cream flavor for your concoction the macaron was warm light and has that soft crunch when you dig into it through the toasted marshmallow toasted right in front of you with a small torch i had the mini which was not sandwiched on the bottom and top by a macaron only the top which is a perfect portion for me some may say its pricey but when you buy a macaron alone at a bakery is about or more wish i lived near by until next time fruity pebble macaron nom nom very cool little ice cream shop they have some great flavors and some pretty creative ones like captain crunch or netflix and chill popcorn flavor their signature fatty daddy was awesome only reason for stars instead of is their fatty daddy is a bit on the pricey side at over for people for their mini version i love fruity flavored ice cream and this place just hits the spot with just that that torched marshmallow tho is just perfect decent ice cream good service overpriced i was excited to try this place out after seeing the reviews i love ice cream more than the average person i tried several flavors and they were decent there were some interesting flavors like fruity loops you then have the option of adding toppings including a macaroon or toasted marshmallow for extra i added a toasted marshmallow for mine and a macaroon for the lady i chose the single scoop for both and it still ended up being just over to be honest the ice cream is just a notch above baskin robbins in my opinion i cant see myself ever choosing this place over something like cold stone its just not worth the cost in my opinion i know macaroons are always expensive but that doesnt explain the expensive ice cream itself on a scale of breyers to tillamook i give this a dryers tucked away in a little corner market is a cute little ice cream shop when i first moved to scottsdale i didnt live very far from here and i could see myself walking over here to have lovely treats and often now as you look for this place dont blink because if you do you will miss it it is not facing miller street but faces the parking lot north of the building i did say tucked away i am not a person for sweets but the kids that i took here loved it the loved the optional toppings specifically the marshmallow i enjoyed the macarons they were deliciously sweet and tasty return factor the cookie cup is like a picasso masterpiece no are alike but they are all so special really enjoyed the netflix chill flavor and the coconut macaron this is on the pricier side for ice cream and hard to find since its tucked away almost in an alley off miller road bomb af try a milkshake with vanilla bean mocha java and white chocolate raspberry ice creams almost everyone loves ice cream and yes it is pricey for ice cream but its hand made small batch ice creams and sorbets where you have options to add house made macarons and other things to your ice cream fatty daddys is hard to find because there isnt a sign at the time of this review i hear that the flavors change weekly so you might not be able to try what i had i had the cantaloup sorbet as a mini fatty daddy that means i had one scoop one macaron and the option to add a house made torched marshmallow a better value might be the full size fatty daddy because that is three scoops two cookies and a marshmallow but i went with the mini because the full size is just too much for me i thought the cantaloup sorbet was amazing because it tasted just like the ripest perfect cantaloup i picked an almond macaron to go with it and skipped the marshmallow the macaron had a nice flavor but a very chewy texture almost like gum my husband also had a mini fatty daddy with cinnamon crunch ice cream and he asked for a vanilla macaron he said the marshmallow was really good the ice cream tasted good but the cereal in it was soggy we also think they gave him the wrong flavor macaron because it didnt taste like vanilla to us and might have been red velvet stars not perfect a little pricey but unique and some flavors really rock wow just wow tasty little hidden gem in scottsdale there is absolutely nothing better than a toasted marsh mellow on top of captain crunch ice cream with captain crunch cereal bites with a caramel macaron good variety of ice creams and sorbets overall cute little shop with friendly staff i just love how cozy and different this place is they have the most inventive and unique combos too i love this please especially in this arizona heat i will be back thank you probably the best ice cream ive ever eaten and i love my ice cream the cereal flavors like fruity pebbles and cinnamon toast crunch were delicious delicious but too expensive for what it was to get full stars i loved the options and im definitely happy i ordered the ice cream with the marshmallow and macaroon however i feel like the macaroons arent as great as other macaroons ive had and for the price i think each component should be delicious on its own again im still super happy i tried this out and the marshmallow is a must wishing this was a fivestar er but man were bummed it was hard to find this place at night no illuminated signage once we found it we were pumped and the girl who welcomed us in was nice unfortunately although we were the only people there and the only people in the parking lot repeating myself here this joint was not busy pretty much everything we came for was sold out the marshmallow you see in every picture on yelp sold out what bothers me about that how do you run out of your signature item especially when its im assuming here not homemade go to the grocery store buy mallows problem solved same with the red velvet macaroons i happened to order the last one leaving my boyfriend to pick from the remaining flavors carmel was also sold out ice cream flavors were good and the macaroon was tasty but for dollars no especially with the inconvenience of ordering from a limited menu and the atmosphere being kinda meh just no this place is adorable its a small ice cream shop and the decor is so cute the employees are very nice and welcoming i enjoyed the mangoneada ice cream after sampling almost everything it was really good they have a unique twist on ice cream flavors i like the chocolate cake batter i think one of the owners like concocts different flavors on his own if you ever talk to him hes pretty passionate about his flavors they need to consider adding a few more options and i would recommend on working on curb appeal you can easily miss this place driving along mcdowellmiller i was very disappointed with my last visit the sample i got of taste the rainbow seemed pretty good but as i ate my cookie bowl i got an overwhelming flavor of key lime flavoring to the point where my friend and i had to throw it away and he never wants to come back}

{29596, Cup O'Karma, 1710 W Southern Ave Ste B7 Mesa AZ 85202, i am glad to be the first to re introduce this location to the yelp community a friend and i ventured in with only a little bit of time before a physiology exam at mcc across the street we were avoiding starbucks at any cost and the cost turned out to be showing up for our exam about minutes late the story about cup o karma was more interesting than an test on kidney function what can i say into the bean was sold for to a non profit organization benefiting seeds of hope seeds of hope is a domestic abuse and sexual assault assistance agency seeking to provide information and advocacy for survivors volunteers work the counter and all proceeds benefit seeds you can find literature on the counter and in the bathroom the place has been redecorated and is very welcoming and warm the women working there are friendly and caring since cup o karma is still pretty new some bugs are still being worked out register issues how much syrup to put in the coffee drinks etc i have had two iced vanilla lattes and one iced chai soy both were delicious i loved studying here it was quiet and not corporate they even have a few breakfast items bagels one morning and croissants another some of the drinks have crazy names although i dont remember them offhand right now one was some kind of chernobyl berry thing stop by its a little expensive but worth the cause ok so for some reason my usual wifi spotcoffee shop was not open last night or this morning weird so i was forced to take matters into my own hands and find a new place to plug my computer in and drink coffee until my usual spot decides when to reopen so i thought i had seen this place from the road its on southern in a strip mall tucked away this place is a cute little treasure its well decorated has an artsy feel to it has artists paintings for sale on the wall with some really cool couches to sit on and get your drink on theres also stainless steel tables in here as well which i love kind of a modern chic feel comfortable classy atmosphere without the stuffiness clean eclectic without being dirty or drab they have all your usual coffee shop drinks with a decent range in prices and sizes they have ice cream shakes italian sodas organic coffees and some teas as well for good measure the location itself is not large rather small but well done with ample seating and space they also have a few outdoor tables and chairs as well they have free wifi but only after you make a purchase i went with a choclate muffin since im a little overcaffinated at the moment i was given the password and login info after i paid for my muffin now here is where they loose a star first i had trouble logging onto thier network it wouldnt even show up on my wireless connection screen i asked the lady behind the counter and she was mildly helpful but she really didnt know what to do mind you i am primarily here to get on the internet okay so she tells me that sometimes the connection here is weird and said that sometimes the signal here is bad and to move tables and try the otherside of the shop ive never heard of one side of a business getting wifi and the other not so i switch sides of the already small shop for some retarded reason it worked weird now i am on the internet typing this review also as a side note they lost a few points for another reason and i will explain normally i dont usually pick upevesdrop on others conversation while out honestly i really could care less and unless its a screaming match im probably not listening when i walked in these ladies were gossiping about something someone borrowed and this one lady was pissed off about it becuase her friend that had borrowed the hadnt paid her back these two women are discussing it and honestly i just thought it was such a personal conversation to be having in the middle of a coffee shop while your working anyways i really do like this place despite the weird wifi connection and most likely will be returning this place supports the training of domestic violence victims please go here and get coffee as your money goes to a good cause well amy bs ftr pretty much covered all the bases ditto on pretty much the whole thing including the chatty employees i had a nice iced green tea and no problems using the wifi where to go with my review now the bathroom at into the bean is a unisex bathroom it was very clean the soap was not overly fragranced as some bathroom soaps are it also did not have one of those industrial fragrance dispensers i hate those i always seem to be in the bathroom when those effing things crank out their metered doses of toxic fumes the wall with the sink and toilet had an interesting finish it had a very dark grey to black wash and over this colorful squares had been stamped in a pattern the squares were in bright colors and the paints used for the stampings were metallic looking it was interesting ok i think that pretty much covers it the next yelper to review this place might want to check out the dumpster out back went here for a phoenix friday coffee night met sunny msherr austin others i cant remember because im getting old coffee wasnt too bad seating was nice prices were ok id go back if i didnt live so far away they seem to be very active in supporting feminist issues which im good with i just had an extremely yummy mocha frappe from here today i havent tried their coffee yet but will re adjust my review once i have tried it anyway i think they are backing a great cause so i dont mind spending the extra money for the products large mocha frappe was next time i will bring my laptop and hang out a while very convenient for me because i go to school across the street i love central phoenix love love love unfortunately i am living in chandler right now and it doesnt look like the coffee shops of the east valley compare to those found in central phoenix all you find are chains and the few privately owned shops still lack that urban vibe ill admit cartel coffee lab comes close but the people who work there are too snobby for their own good you work in tempe people not scottsdale after getting sick of driving to phoenix for a decent cup o joe i tried out cup okarma when i visited it was surprisingly empty even with mcc being right across the street is school in session there who knows but i was able to have the whole spot to myself the reason this place gets stars is not because of its comfortable couches or quirky art on the contemporary walls but because it is non profit cup okarma was donated by its previous owner for and it is now a natn community project coffee shop with a cause im in if youre in the east valley and are thirsty to support social change stop by and see the folks at cup okarma the cup o karma is such a neat coffee shop it has a lot of character and flair and a great iced coffee tiny little place with great ambiance i love the fact it is staffed by volunteers and all proceeds go to seeds of hope good coffee if they had a few more available munchies they would be all set really good and refreshing iced tea i stopped by to run in and grab some liquid because i was really feeling dehydrated and had a fantastic tropical iced tea it was exactly what i needed and was craving such a great place i look forward to trying the coffee friendly vibe and comfortable coaches i had a tangerine or something iced tea that was delicious and thirst busting the staff was friendly and open i went for the comedy open mic and had a lot of fun there were some music open mic participants as well seems like a good place to go to either be alone or chat people up im sorry to be the first to really criticize this place but it really was not good at all i understand that it is a non profit place and its there to help people and that is why i gave it stars instead of one the bf and i went here this morning to get our coffee fix and to try it for the coffee tour of phoenix it was a huge disappointment i ordered an iced latte and he ordered a hot latte the hot latte had no foam both lattes had a very strange flavor we had both asked for milk but it tasted like she used half and half or a milk substitute it had a weird fake quality about it further the coffee was just about nonexistent it was like when i was a kid and my mom would put a teaspoon of coffee in my milk because i liked the flavor not what im looking for at a coffee place and not what we paid a drink for we both ended up throwing away over half of our drinks because they were so bad the place has a cute look but i will never be back ugh ps it may be immature but i think its funny that they have signs all around with their shortened name cok heh heh i upped the star here because the place is a not for profit my mocha was not great barely good but im sure i will be able to find something i like what i do like is the atmosphere great people and a good place to hang very friendly and open comfortable seating and vibe id give it a try friendly service good coffee and iced tea and a great selection of hot teas along with a cool ambiance and a welcoming environment what more could you want i havent had a chance to try their pastries but they look very good and they have a nice variety of instant oatmeals try their tropical iced tea and their spicy cinnamon black tea both are excellent it is a non for profit place decent coffeelatte selections i only ordered tea there is live music most nights but it is such a small space kind of uncomfortable id rather go to starbucksand i hate starbucks what a great place and a great cause i went there last night for comedy open mic the comedians were running there new stuff by us and it was great my wife had a iced green tea and i had the pacific northwest smoothie which was out of this world good and reminded me of oregon this place would rock in oregon all of the money goes to help support natn http www natn az comhomecupokarma copied from their homepage cup o karma community cafe for a cause a project of natn provides job training opportunities for women participating in our seeds programs natn is a nonprofit agency committed to addressing the health safety economic and social justice issues related to domestic violence sexual assault and substance abuse through education public awareness and direct services all proceeds generated through cup o karma are used to advance the mission of natn please check this place out and support their cause we went to see a comedy show but we loved the place it has a great emphasis helping those who have been affected by abuse and the service and offerings are outstanding i tried my hubbys smoothie mmmmmmmm my green tea was great and they have sugar in the raw which i prefer a great place to see comedy or hear poetry and relax on an inexpensive date while helping others win win win great coffee clean environment good service laid back atmosphere the best thing about this place is the cause this is a non profit coffee house that helps women families recover from domestic violent abusive past relationships they do this by helping women gain their independence to live a life free from violence if youre searching for a local coffee house stop in drink coffee for a cause love this place warm inviting the staff who are volunteers are the sweetest people very welcoming the coffee is yummy i love hot mochas and they use ghiradelli chocolate love this place i go pretty much every wednesday to listen to paul knight playsing great atmosphere great people love the chai and mocco sp cocoa latte both hot and cold and of course love the fact that its all for a good cause they also sale crafts and other things to help raise money for natn check it out you wont be disappointed was there saturday night to listen to a friend play his music i have been there a few times the staff is always friendly and they serve a great cup of coffee i drank the latte and was warned that the four i had could cause me to lose sleep well they were right i did but i will be back to enjoy at least one more or four good nice people user friendly had a lunch meeting there staff was good to us nice and clean easy parking easy in and out went out of our way to find this place since we were close to the hospital only to find it was closed got there at pm on a monday yelp says it closes at pm a delightful enough experience at a delightful enough location its kind of out of the way but its got a good cause so i dont mind cup okarma is a simple little coffee shop just off of southern near target west of longmore its tucked back in a quiet little strip mall and it pretty unassuming the sign on the building simply says coffee shop inside there are a few tables of various sizes and a couple of boards with their offerings as a non coffee drinker im more interested in fruity drinks that seem to be ubiquitous in these parts at this time of the year i dont do tea so it was decided that a caramel vanilla shake was in order hand scooped ice cream big plus and a swirl of caramel and i was on my way the big draw here was really the free wifi it wasnt blazing fast but didnt frustrate me either middle of the road ask the barista for the username and password the restroom was tidy and the place was pretty quiet the gal behind the counter was new and was being trained by the boss who was there walking her through the ropes she runs a tight ship here everything has a very specific procedure and i was happy to see that cleaning and menu precision is high on the list they do entertainment throughout the month music open mic poetry etc theres a stage that tucks away and i had to leave before open mic night started as for the cause a portion of your purchase goes towards helping people recover from domestic abuse i dont know much more about it but there are pics under the glass in the table and more information there about how to help out i figure if you can sip your shake and help out your fellow human youre probably doing something right i like that they raise money for charity nice cozy place with good coffee and friendly employees what i like best is that the music is kept at a low enough volume to relax unlike so many other noisy places spotless restroom easy parking good cause at am after dropping the hubby off at mcc for class across the street i was just looking for a place to chill for an hour i saw the big coffee sign from southern and thought eureka uh they were closed the door and windows outside display a lot but not their hours of business and yelp claims that this place opens at am as they should if not earlier with it being a coffee establishment waiting outside confused another customer approaches the door and i decided to ask him if he had been here before he hadnt and we noticed people inside i knocked and waved an employee over who told us that they dont open until am well my fellow coffee consumer left for starbucks and i nearly went with him i only stayed because i wanted to write this review coffee isnt that great anyway but thats the only thing i purchased they wont serve it to you by french press either one last thing the gal who served me was polite but uninformed she didnt know how much a coffee refill was and had to ask the older gal working refills are the of your drink btw the older lady decided to pour my coffee while the other took my payment but interrupted her twice asking how i take my coffee she could have just looked at me and asked instead of insisting that she tell her that i take it just black lady left plenty of room for cream regardless karmas a b sometimes cool location points drinks employee treatment treat your employee better i identify with employees who are not treated well in front of customers the americano was one of the best ive had not too harsh but such bold flavor this is a non profit coffee house that supports the end of violence with women will absolutely be frequenting this coffee shop this is a cafe with a cause all the proceeds go to support the national advocacy training network you can find out more about this organization here www nant az orgseeds throw in a caring atmosphere free wi fi comfy chairs and sofas and some tasty tea and im good to get my work done hopefully theyll have t shirts soon cute little place nice people good coffee and theyre committed to a couple of social causes which is great and good free wi fi everyone is friendly and the atmosphere is grounding quaint and they have bands playing at pm during the week went on a friday night there were a couple of musical acts playing and a very good vibe in the place quite busy with many types of people as diverse as mesa gets anyway friendly service too a cozy atmosphere where i was comfortable to hangout with my son the beverages were competitively priced and generously sized the employees were friendly and welcoming dont judge a book by its cover i was initially skeptical of this place the only signage was coffee and it was tucked in a small shopping center i had expected a hipster coffee shop and gotten a sort of kitschy community coffee shop we stopped in for a quick coffee which was delicious and it turned out to be open mic night we wound up staying for a couple of hours listening to the folky lineup the music and coffee were way above our expectations and the best part is that a portion of the profits go to benefit domestic violence education this place was a surprising all around win definitely worth checking out love the cause love the coffee employees and open mics very cool little spot to relax and read a book i like coming here to get work done i do wish there were even one or two more food options because i want to support the mission i have lots of work i can do in a coffee shop but also i get hungry be nice if i could switch it up a little more anyway its comfy chill and the bathroom is neat and clean overall nice vibe im a coffee snob and i needed wifi wifi is a sure thing and quality of wifi isnt that important however a great cup of coffee is critical cok handled both cool vibe friendly barista terrific cup of their locally roasted brew and the wifi seemed as good as any ill be back great chai super friendly barista cute shop highly recommend this amazing venue is such a valuable community asset this charity run cozy room serves as the public end of an effective mode of transition for victims of domestic violence while serving teas coffees lattes desserts this cup o karma natn organization provides housing counseling and job training for victims of domestic violence this is such a needed remedial option for victims mostly women and their children to have a safe place to go get educated about the causes solutions to domestic violence acquire on the job training for marketable skills many people associated w cup o karma are survivors of domestic violence i am personally a survivor i was in an abusive marriage in the early s there was no program available in that community slo ca at that time it took some severe incidences to cause me to earnestly seek getting out which is very difficult to do wo help domestic violence is passed on from parents who were often abused as youngsters to their children or young relatives its a cyclic psychological situation abused people contribute to their children becoming abused because the children grow up seeing abuse as a normal behavior in their environs and are conditioned to become further players in this dirty game if you know of anyone who you think may be a victim of domestic violence please get them in touch with us please see the website at http www natn az orgcup okarma like follow our

{34070, Aveda Institute Charlotte, 1520 South Blvd. Ste 150 South End Charlotte NC 28203, i absolutely love the aveda institute i went for my first time a few months ago and fell in love i got a cut and all over foils for including a tip i wasnt just getting a trim i got a completely new style and it was truly the best haircut i have ever gotten i dont think i would ever go anywhere else even though they are students they are all young and know what is in style and arent afraid to take a risk the instructors are walking around throughout the entire process so there really is no fear when it comes to getting a horrible haircut an instructor also comes over after the final cut and checks out your hair and asks you a few questions about it they also use a variety of products on your hair and tell you what they are before using them the products are also amazing so i would definitely suggest purchasing those an added bonus is the free parking garage across from the salon that saves time and money it is a great bargain and i would suggest it to anyone i would however suggest you bring in a photo of the haircut you are looking into because they are students and they havent had enough experience to suggest a completely new look for you to make their job easier do a little research my absolute favorite service at the aveda institute is eyebrow wax they do a great professional job for anyone scared of getting waxed they want your eyebrows to look natural not pencil thin so trust them and let them work their magic i have been going since they opened it is a great bargain i like getting my hair colored better than cut i find that beginning stylist dont texturize as much as i like but color they can manage just fine this is based on my husbands personal experience i have not had any service done here but wanted to see his results first yes i admit i wanted him to be experimented on first scheduling was easy and got an appointment within a couple days once he arrived they were running late and asked him to reschedule for an hour later he showed a slight look of disappointment so they took it back and made his initial appointment work not sure why the fuss the salon itself was professional he took a photo in of what he was wanting the stylist listened attentively when his hair was styled it looked great i am very pleased to see a great cut the best part is that he bought some product we love aveda products and got a hair cut and spent what we would have paid for just a hair cut at a nearby salon i love saving money when i can especially for his haircuts since he goes in on a monthly basis ill go in next and see if they do womens style as well as a mens style i wish that this place offered the massage service maybe thats a future endeavor for this site this review is strictly for the esthetician services at aveda institute i needed facial badly ok ok i didnt need a facial but i sure wanted one and i didnt want to spend a bunch of cash enter aveda institute its right around the corner from me conveniently located in the north end of south end this particular cosmetology school offers a whole variety of spa treatments from hair to skincare to waxing etc after chatting with the very since receptionist about their facial types i chose the minute tourmaline facial priced at which is an absolute steal amanda was my esthetician and she was absolutely wonderful the whole process took roughly hours exactly what the receptionist claimed on the phone and i was so happy with the experience amanda took me through a bunch of different questions in the beginning to determine my personality goals of the facial and scents to go along with it it was super relaxing and my skin is quite happy with me this particular facial focuses on exfoliating and re engergizing the skin while amanda offered to do extractions if needed i chose not to for this is an amazing facial i highly highly recommend it note to those who want to score some amazing and affordable aveda services here call ahead if you work a traditional job and you need a saturday appointment expect to wait at least weeks for an available time slot be patient and kind these men and women are students at the school while you are paying for their services keep in mind that they are still learning and you will likely have to give your input to their instructors afterwards block out some serious time especially for hair treatments at a previous visit it took almost four hours from start to finish for a partial highlight this as no fault of the students it just took a long time to flag down an instructor for the various parts of the service i was visiting charlotte this october for a conference and decided to check this place out i had an all over color and hair cut it took a little over three hours but turned out great my stylist was one of the newest but the instructor was available to oversee all the critical moments overall it you know what you want and keep it simple this is a fine low cost option the entrance to the salon is on the backside of the building facing the parking garage an easy walk from the lynx bland street station weekends are super busy so either plan ahead or go during the week the aveda institute is pretty amazing amazing service and amazing prices i did end up dropping about but thats because i went kind of crazy and bought a bunch of products the haircut and style including shampooing and scalpneckshoulder massage was only my stylist was dana and she was wonderful she was super detail oriented and determined to make sure her work was perfection she was also very attentive and offered good recommendations if youre concerned that youll be a guinea pig dont be all students are well supervised and the instructors are fast to step in with guidance and a little assistance when needed but just an fyi make sure you have set the appropriate amount of time aside to come in for a haircut because the students are so well monitored they need instructor approval before proceeding with certain steps that being said expect to be here for a couple hours too bad im not staying in charlotte for too much longer if i were i would definitely return and ask for dana luckily ill be returning to indianapolis where they have their own aveda institute i have been a long time guinea pig for the price for cut wash you cant beat it yes these are students and yes there have been nail biting moments when i wondered what on earth is going to happen to my head however i dont have emotional attachment to my hair it grows and frankly dont have the budget or the heart to throw big money on something like a haircut i know im weird and genetically lucky my hair is low maintenance so this place is great for me ditto ing is that a word other reviews it takes forever but the bigger problem is i was never seen on time i personally think they need a better check in system i have waited as long as minutes only to find out the student assigned to me was at lunch and didnt know about my appointment so now when i check in i stand wait and i politely ask them to check on the student after minutes because more often than not your student is not going to show up anytime soon and they will assign you a new one my most recent haircut last thursday was eventful the original cut was barely acceptable at best my hair ended up about inches shorter than the picture i showed the guy justin and shapeless after hours i left owondering how the heck am i going to be presentable in public but am still giving it a star this is why i called the next day left a message for the instructors she actually called back a few hours later and offered me a fix it appointment next tuesday i went back yesterday and here came the wait ended up with christina instead of amy and with courtneys the instructor closer supervision my hair is now fixed and christina did well with the razor after i asked why they dont use razor to cut hair which gives great texture and faster final thought dont go here for haircut if you arent brave or will cry over bad cut skip the nail service better job done at nail salon for about the same price faicial is ok no extraction allowed i have been going to the institute for services for over two years and not once have i been disappointed in the quality of staff or final product until today my stylist did not offer me anything to drink nor a scalp massage although she didnt give off a mean vibe she did not say more then ten words to me throughout the entire process maybe she was nervous all i got was a trim and i have very short hair so it wasnt complicated i tried to make small talk to perhaps make her feel comfortable as the silence made me uncomfortable but she didnt latch on i am pleased with the cut but in the end she didnt use any product i was so surprised she didnt put anything in my hair i just wanted to check out and leave i really needed a haircut and my old stylist had moved away so i was left looking for an affordable haircut that didnt look crappythis was harder than it sounded so based on some yelp reviews i decided to call aveda and book an appointment for that day i have to say i wasnt exactly prepared for how huge the school is signed in for my appointment and was promptly greeted by my stylist lauren she was cheerful and asked me what i wanted to do with my hair and made some suggestions of what she thought would do well the haircut does take a bit longer than usual due to the instructors needing to approve everything but at least you know you arent getting a messed up haircut the scalp massage was super relaxing and by the time i left my hair was feeling and looking great the best part is the price all this for just tip aveda has now become my newest go to for an affordable great looking haircut with quality service i went to the aveda institute for the first time a couple of weeks ago and i must admit that i was very impressed i went there for an eyebrow wax but the experience was much more than that i was greeted upon arrival and the student performing my service was friendly on time and very professional my visit included a brow consultation to determine how i actually wanted my brows to look after the waxing and included aromatherapy the prices are also extremely reasonable aveda insures your satisfaction even more by having the instructor to speak with you after your service so that you can critique your experience sometimes i hesitate to book at schools like aveda im not overly attached to my hair and im never set on an exact look but i always like to bounce ideas off my stylist and when i go to a school i never know how much time theyve spent on the floor and how much input i can get without them finding waiting for and then bringing over their instructor but after almost months in this town i still havent found a stylist i love so i thought why not give this a shot i booked two days in advance and got into the am cattle call slot people milling around in the retail area somewhat impatiently waiting for their named to be called i make it a point to ask how long they think it will take it hardly ever takes that long but with the students constantly checking in with instructors its nice to be aware of how long you might be in the chair eileen was great we talked through what i was thinking i wanted done and what we could do and then came the instructor wait what seems like forever then they went over everything the formulas for the colors the cut the way the colors should be weaved in etc very thorough which is a good thing then she got to work on my million foils in the end she did a nice job i got exactly what we discussed for the first time ever though i actually was asked to stand up for my hair cut she says at her height she has trouble with the longer hair when theyre in the chair and as a student im glad she knows what works for her at the moment id rather stand up for a few minutes and get a great haircut then get home and notice the back looks a little off because she was having trouble overall steal of a price for cut and color great students and great conversation not too pushy on the products though its hard not to pick one or two up anyway and got out minutes earlier than expected they do take walk ins though it is mostly appointment based five and a half hours my god what was i thinking while the price is right i can think of better things to do on a saturday based on previous reviews i was expecting to walk out with an awesome hairdo no such luck my highlights were patchy and they left the foil on too long my haircut while it does look ok is nothing like i asked for perhaps i should have mentioned all of this when i was walking out but after five and a half hours i just wanted to get out i thought about going back for another try my hair begged me not to i went there twice for color i never came out with a glaringly bad color job but it was nothing to write home about the first time i went i actually had to ask if they had done anything because i couldnt tell a difference for the price i wasnt expecting much and would definitely recommend it to anyone under a strict budget what i didnt like was that it took five hours for a partial i just wanted to fix the roots its not like i was asking for multiple treatments or anything drastic it was a simple touch up i wanted to shoot myself after that experience i figured my time was more valuable and i would rather spend the extra to get three hours of my life where i wasnt sitting in a chair and get more noticeable results both my stylists were sweet but i thought that the instructors were pretentious bitches i also got a facial it was free they were running a special become a fan on facebook and they give away manis pedis and facials every once in a while the girl was very professional and it was very relaxing but it was what is was a basic facial they washed my face exfoliated used some aromatherapy stuff and moisturized i could have done it at home but it was free at least the experience was nice i dont know who would actually pay for that walking into the aveda institute i wasnt sure what to expect would it be one huge classroom would it feel like going to school the answer is no it feels like you are walking into a professional salon there is an array of aveda products lining the wall hard wood floors modern decor and warm receptionists i decided to get highlights and my colorist took the time to discuss what i wanted since they are students they do take extra time documenting everything so that a supervisor can review i found the supervisors to be very nice and attentive unfortunately even though the color came out well the application was lacking the colorist did not get very close to my roots and i had almost an inch of space that looked like regrowth that being said it is a learning institution i wasnt expecting perfection and i didnt pay for perfection only for a partial i called and told them i was dissatisfied they got me an appointment asap to fix the problem i had the color redone and i walked out very happy no charge for this i will be going back cant beat the price but be prepared to bring a some patience if you need something great to eat you go to a gourmet restaurant if you need something faster you may go to a fast food or quick serve restaurant if you want a deal you go to aveda institute i have only been to the spa so can only speak about the beauty section being incredibly slow by secondhand experience but i think the spa is such a great place to get a facial its almost a hybrid facialmassage and all around relaxing time completely well worth the money the aesthetician in training will do a quick survey about skin type etc which is a little annoying if youve been there countless times since they should have it on file during a foot soak and then they ask you to disrobe and start the treatment they have a variety of treatments based on skin priorities but they all are lovely ive even had the tourmaline exfoliating one during the winter which was an extra charge but still a good deal they cleanse then do two treatments on your face and do a nice arm shoulder hand massage and sometimes do your feet as well the music is usually really relaxing and ive only ever had one aesthetician i wasnt crazy about most are excellent and some of the young girls are entertaining but you can also keep quiet the whole time too in some rooms the wooden beds can creak at the end their instructor will come in for feedback the students must get evaluated on the upsell because they always bring a basket of aveda products that are relevant to your story and i always end up purchasing a couple then when you go from the quiet serenity of the spa area to the bustling loudness of the main area its a bit of a shock dont expect to be pretty when you leave because youre all clean moisturized and relaxed a relaxing hour facial and massage for sold you can do the minute one too but it hardly seems worth the short time i just wish it was easier to get an appointment i have been to the aveda institute twice the first time for a cut and highlights and the second time for a manicure it is difficult to rate them higher than stars as i liked the haircut i got and the color was pretty good however the entire hair process took hours and the manicure was sub par both times i have been greeted promptly and i only waited in the lobby for a few minutes my hair stylist was very nice and we chatted the entire time very pleasant she did take four hours and i think she left the foils on too long she processed my hair for minutes after she got the last foil in but it took her probably an hour from the first foil application though i understand they are students and id rather they take the time to learn properly than just zip through i was just going for some golden blonde highlights not my favorite color job but i think i wasnt aggressive enough in asking for a lighter shade the cut was fine nothing complicated got about inches cut off and added some layers i did show her a photo of what i wanted and she only glanced at it briefly the end result didnt really look much like the photo but i still liked it i was sorely disappointed in the manicure first off they do not cut any hangnailsdry skin from around your nails this is one of the top reasons i get a manicure because its so awkward to do it on my own and i suffer from a lot of hangnails the nail polish was very very thick and a couple hours later i saw lots of little bubbles in the polish telling me it went on too thick finally one of my nails chipped the next morning after i did virtually nothing after having the manicure i certainly did nothing that should cause my nails to chip in less than hours i will not go back as planned for a full manipedi however ill go back for my hair simply because i dont have a complicated style nor am i overly emotionally attached to my hair plus i really love aveda products and you cannot beat the price as a grad student i dont have a lot of money to spend on my hair ive been to other schools for deals but aveda gets it right everytime you should definitely expect it to take longer than your usual cut color my frequent services but unlike other reviewers ive never spent more than two hours in the salon also there have been plenty of visits where i was offered a free mini facial or hand massage while i waited for the color to process bringing a picture is a good idea especially if you want something specific i bring a picture of my bangs honestly i will probably continue to go to aveda even after i graduate i cant tell the difference in their services vs full price salons im always happy when i leave and feel like its well spent and up for the same services elsewhere also i always tip my stylist they earn it if youre an impatient person this is not the spot for you however my impatience and my frugality always battle it out and frugality wins and i go to aveda ive been a few times for either a cut or color done however they both left me fidgeting in my chair tapping my feet waiting for it to be over with since they have to ok it with the instructors ive never had my hair come out blue or butchered so thats a good thing and always been pleased with the turn out nice thing is if you find someone you like you can request an appointment with them again if they are still in school if your schedule allows try to get an appointment during the work week its much easier to get than booking a weekend appointment ok first off its a school ive had services at schools before bc im a notorious cheapie but some things yelpers you just shouldnt be cheap about like a brazilian wax just plunk down the with a trusted professional and be smooth and out of there in minutes instead i spent and a half hours of agony with a nervous student and her equally nervous instructor yanking at my lady bits at one point i think i had an out of body experience and im totally set if im ever captured and tortured for the revolution ill stand strong compadres because ive already been to hell and lived to yelp about it other than the excruciating pain the people are friendly and the environment soothing and of course aveda products are top notch so i recovered without any permanent damage but never again i was in such a rush to get out of there i accidentally left the belt i wore behind ive been too traumatized to come through and pick it back up and my belts are like children to me im sure ill be back one day for threading or a color or some kind of pamper treatment like i said theyre very professional and friendly and im not trying to dissuade anyone from going just from getting a waxing treatment done there i just need a little more time to put the last visit behind me i live in southend and walk by this place all the time i was over due for my usual cut at modern uptown usually costing between new hire cut to fledgling cut to way more than im willing to spend the aveda institute is a student school my cut cost i was optimistic surely one who is studying their craft would want to show their skill or if lacking skill at least try to show they studied up i was concerned when i walked in and saw many of the staff in hats hats at a salon by those who are practicing their work i was happy to see my stylist did not sport a fedora or trucker hat she had garland in her hair garland on a saturday morning maybe shes just artistic tis true i am an optimist not really an artist more just lazy she did a free hand cut typically a stylist will wash and straighten my hair then while wet partition using clips and cut it in sections kind of systematically ensuring an even cut cutting it free style didnt give me a whole lot of confidence in her technique at the end of the cut post drying i wasnt even she took a bit of time to even it out eventually getting it pretty close i didnt have confidence to let her cut my bangs my hair cut is fine but i will need to go to a real salon for a touch up and to get my lanky bangs under control overall it was like the kids were playing at salon not students learning their trade i doubt id go back tip tip more than i bargained for this aveda institute location offers every hair nail body treatments imaginable in addition they have spa packages when i first saw some of those prices when i first moved to charlotte i said holy batman thats low all services are performed by supervised students and i have utilized the services of the aveda institute charlotte on a number of occasions and have been pleased with the outcome but i want to fully disclose that students are the providers of the beauty services and you have to keep an open mind for example there was a student who could not do a french manicure but i got a pretty nail color and she did a good job on the flip side i got the a great min facial there on another beauty trip so get ready to get your beauty on when you arrive at this location yay i love aveda products love that we have this school i have them to thank for leading me to my hairstylist now noel who graduated is doing big things at a salon locally the place is clean prices are super reasonable the only down side is trying to make an appointment bc of the reasonable prices their hours they stay booked everyone there is really nice they arent pushy about putting extra services or products on you however yes because their teachers are grading them dont expect a quick in out appointment their customer service is terrible i wanted to buy a few gift cards from them for the holidays the website didnt allow me to move on to the next card after i took the trouble to sign up and fill out the first card it said of but there was no button to move on to the next card when i called aveda they said they cant help with that when i asked if they could just do it over the phone and mail it to me since their site wasnt workinng they said no apparently they are not capable of putting something in the mail themselves pain in the butt and waste of my time dont go there they will just do the bare minimum ive been going here for about months ive had manicures pedicures haircuts all over hair color and foil highlights for manipedi services theyre ok the past few times ive gotten students who have made it quite clear tht they do not want to be in that rotation my last pedicure was terrible i told the instructor at the end that the polish looked awful and the student hadnt exfoliated my feet at all all she said was it looked good and asked if i wanted the student to exfoliate my feet further after they were all dried and the pedi bowl was drained i declined this past weekend i went in for a hair cut and partial foil highlights i specifically told the student that i wanted a few highlights and i wanted to maintain my natural brown hair but with a few highlights to add some dimension i told her i wanted it a little chunky but not over the top i just turned years old i didnt want to look like a teenager i sat in that chair for hours and was only able to get up to stretch my legs once to have my hair shampooed after the color was done my back hurt so bad the student ran out of color times my highlights arent chunky at all theyre so fine that it makes me look like i have gray hair im trying to schedule a time to go back and have this fixed but at this point i think theyre going to just have to do an all over color to go back to my natural brown hair color its days before christmas and i dont have time for this mess theyre closed next week so they say if i dont come today im sol im waiting on a manager to call me back to see if i can just get a refund for this mess even if they did all over haircolor i still want a refund since the girl messed up my highlights so badly i will not be returning i really like this place you have to be a bit patient because it takes th students a little but longer to cut your hair but the instructors do a good job of making sure that things look good in the end its actually kind of interesting to here about all of the things that they think about going into the cut by far the best cut youll find in the city at the end the stylist are required to recommend products to you but there is really no pressure to buy them been back a few more times and the quality of the service and attention has remained steadily great new things theyve put into effect a new price echelon a few dollars more for services with students closer to graduation makes sense to me theyve extended their hours into evenings mon fri p p im sure this has helped lighten the load for weekend appointments before if you needed a saturday appointment you had to book at least weeks out perfect art ask for jordan my layers are beautiful layered cuts it feels very bouncy my first trip was in november a week before my wedding it was fantastic i have gone back several times since i have gotten my nails done my hair cut and my absolute favorite the essential back treatment the students do a good job and the staff is friendly cant beat the price todays visit was probably the shortest amount of time ive spent at this place for a haircut i might have lucked out w my appointment time because there werent many clients in the lobby nor in stylist chairs my stylist was prompt and friendly when she greeted me and gave me the exact cut i wanted with a little assistance from an instructor before checking out at the front desk i informed my stylist i was looking for a product that would deliver a certain hold and she was able to direct me to a liquid gel that i purchased right away slapped some on and love it aaaahhhh the aveda school what a little hidden treasure this place is had i written this review three years ago thats when i had my first aveda school experience i would have said it was a great salon with even better prices for their services now in i can still say its a great place but the prices for the services have certainly spiked the aveda school is definitely for those of us who dont have the energy or the funds to salon hop looking for the perfect stylistcolorist yes i color my hair and i am not ashamed to admit it i mean where can you go in clt and have sometimes people working on your hair at one time just remember this the person actually providing the service is a student and studentslow if you are there for a cut and color be prepared to be there for a minimum of hours but also know you will leave there looking pretty fabulous the only other service i have had at aveda is the brow wax which was good as well i will say the estehticians are usually afraid for hurting me i try to assure them that i am already voluntarily agreeing to have hot wax applied to my face and then have it ripped off with a tiny piece of cloth i know what i am getting into and you wont hurt me for those who are still not convinced i reassure them by saying i have passed kidney stones and i have given birth i think i can handle a little hot wax the kidney stone story usually does the trick with all that being said the aveda school is well worth the experience ive had three services in the past two days all three were exceptionally pleasant my haircut came out just the way i wanted the stylist was very professional and listened to my wishes i didnt find her to be slow but perhaps i got lucky with someone who was getting ready to graduate she actually did a better job styling my hair than my previous stylist whom id been seeing for over five years my pedicure was very relaxing and i was pleased with the way my toes looked afterward the nail technician wasnt nearly as aggressive with scrubbing the feet or massaging them but it was still very nice the hot tea was excellent id only had one other facial in my life before my one here but was very satisfied with the service they do put items that they recommend for you in a basket but there is certainly no pressure to buy them five stars considering you cant get this kind of treatment and service for this price anywhere if i had to describe my experiences in one word it would be inconsistent i had been going to aveda for a mens cut for three years and ive had my best cut there and my worst cut ever the last two have just been bad not terrible it seems that the instructors have changed and there isnt the attention to detail there once was the stylist have all been super sweet but the skill level seems to have declined i have short hair and i had a two hour shampoo and cut it wasnt a complex cut and i had pictures of my perfect cut from two years ago for them to go by i love the people but be very cautious if you are getting work done for an event it could be great but maybe not let me start off by saying that before i made the hair appointment i indicated that i had more curlykinky texture and preferred someone with more experience in straightening that type of hair the person who made the appointment stated that the person they were booking me with was a senior student and had the experience i was seeking while sitting in the chair out of curiosity i asked the student if she had any experience working with my texture and she reassured me that she had a couple of clients with similar textures to make a long story short i was there for hours while the student kept trying to straightened my hair she kept trying to get help from her teachers but they seemed to be too busy it was only after the third burn from a flat iron the instructor come over to assist the teacher was only a little bit more experienced than her student and i left with puffy hair i will never go back and suggests that those with similar hair textures do the same the first time i came here i was extremely nervous but after learning that the teachers are constantly wandering around and giving their input i calmed down the students work at a much slower pace but they do a great job ive been twice for highlights and a haircut and both times i walked out of there extremely satisfied and loving my new do both times i went i also had one of the massage students do a free handforearm massage which was a nice bonus and very relaxing ill definitely come here the next time im in town to get my hair done since the aveda institute in my hometown is nowhere near as good as this one the aveda institute of charlotte is wonderful and i love that they have evening hours in my opinion there are few things more relaxing to end a day than with a relaxing haircut and blowdry it certainly saves time in the morning too it is also wonderful that they they provide complimentary aromatherapy samples during haircuts the trainer approval sessions are also very interesting because i feel like i learn something new about my hair each time it is important to note that because this is the teaching school for aveda in charlotte the stylists are all students but honestly in my experience they are just as professional and sometimes more creative than stylist in salons who work with the same clients time after time it is difficult to develop a relationship with a stylist because they are typically only on the floor for months but for the cost quality and general experience it is still the best deal in town the only reason i do not rate the institute with stars is because the appointments always take a bit longer than i would like for a haircut medium to long length i would suggest allowing at least to hours for the appointment this is definitely not a get a haircut during your lunch hour salon but the quality and experience and evening hours cause me not to weigh the appointment length too heavy against the salon i like this place i feel like its very welcoming and the atmosphere is pretty nice you can even get a bit of make up before you leave and its complimentary there are a couple of things they could do to make it better the appts should be a bit faster they take longer than other places but if you are not in a hurry then its not a problem the waxing is not really great i had better in charlotte and thats saying a lot since no where in charlotte they do great waxing i will be going back for color haircut but not for waxing been comming here since they opened as long as you know what you want or a good idea and know these are students you are good to go this trip i had the most amazing facial ever booked another as a matter of fact way better than most full priced facials at other salonsspa i highly reccomend you have to understand what to expect your hair will be cut by a student it could be their first haircut ever or they could be about to graduate your haircut or color will be inspected by an instructor at the conclusion of the service they usually will take a few snips here and there if the student missed anything there are only a few instructors so you may be waiting it will take much longer than at a real salon what else would you expect they are students the prices for services are much cheaper than nice salons that use aveda products which are awesome knowing these facts i think you can have a good experience here i dont go here for color i dont want to risk that with a student i periodically go here for a cut though and would recommend any guy that normally uses a great clips or discount place to give it a try im a pretty low maintenance gal so hair isnt really on the top of my to do list still when i find myself seriously thinking maybe i should shave my head i know its time for a trim luckily a coworker of mine is a student here and needed a model anyway so it worked out for both of us i was told to park in the deck behind the building but the deck was completely full i used to live in south end so it was easy for me to find parking nearby but it still made me late and there was no back up plan provided by the salon when i apologized and said i was late because of the parking garage being full the counter girls just kind of shrugged and said yeah we know this is really my only gripe my haircut went great chelsa did a great job shampooing me and recommending products she got some directions and advice from her instructor about the style i wanted and we were off i had brought my kindle with me so i did some reading and facebooking and let her concentrate she got some more approvals at different points during the haircut both the instructors nearby and other students were very hospitable asking me how i was and offering me drinks it took right around and a half hours which is about what i was expecting its definitely a teaching salon so if youre not prepared for students who are learning this might not be for you but for wash and wear low drama people like myself it was a perfect fit ill definitely be back ive been going to aveda for several years and been pleased yes they are students but they are supervised and ive consistently found they really want to do a good job this past week a co worker and i decided to go together on thursday evening it was the first time i had made an evening appointment due to a new schedule the appointments are at pm and they close at pm as anyone who has been here before knows sometimes the simplest haircut and blow dry can run over two hours still we showed up minutes early thankfully they took my co worker on time it was her first time there but i wasnt taken until the women who cut our hair were part of a new class of students who attend on thurs fri and sat from am to pm thats a full day it was also only their second day on the floor with the public it really showed with the two students who cut our hair they were nervous and tired by the time pm rolled around i always bring the same picture with me to show the student but this time she didnt seem to care the instructor c with dimples and tattoos was the only one on the floor with about students there was a lot of time wasted with waiting around for the one instructor so c looked at the picture quickly and let the student start about ten minutes in i could tell the student was struggling so i asked her to call c over on how to proceed irritation seemed to be c s middle name and i could see why since the students did not have adequate supervisory coverage she was also less than professional with some comments anyway she took over and cut most of my hair ive had much better from students who have had a little more experience ill chalk it up to the less than ideal circumstances my co worker had a similar experience and the whole time felt rushed my recommendation dont go in the evenings when the oversight is minimal and they dont really allow the students enough time this is one of my favorite places to get a pedicure the products are amazing it feels like my feet are being massaged with silk everyone is really friendly and they have a dedicated area for nail care request a magazine or two sit back and relax while your feet are pampered pros a pedicure is only they use wonderful high end aveda products the nail care area is cute there are four stations it would be a great activity for a girls day out the students are soo nice they keep track of the products and oils that they use on you each visit overtime they develop a personal profile to make sure they provide you with the best service after your service they give you a little bottle of polish to take with you a gift how awesome cons students provide the service most of whom specialize in hair not nails and if you find one you like its only temporary because they graduate im gonna miss you jessica they dont use the jets during the pedicure because it would require additional cleaning to save money they cut the nail files in half or quarters some times its a bit awkward for the technicians to work with the paint job isnt as refined as other nail salons but no worries the pros far outweigh the cons they provide a service for only i also enjoy some of their beautyskin care products i am a huge fan of the rosemary mint hand and body wash one product that can be used as a soap or body wash it makes an excellent hand soap the aroma is divine i feel like ive stepped into a spa every time i wash my hands ive only used it as a body wash a few times didnt feel as silky as i like i think its better suited to be a hand soap regarding the salon ive only gotten my hair done once i wasnt pleased with the outcome most of the stylist dont have a lot of experience with ethnic which is a nice way to say thick hair but they have such good prices i had to give them a try in summary schedule a pedicure asap treat yourself to some of their beauty products and proceed with caution to the salon its easy to forget but theyre students great place to have your hair cut and colored remember they are students ive been coming here for more the years the instructors check their work the cost is a lot less then what you will be charged in a salon situation sponsoring a gala and all i know how to do to my hair is blow dry it lets be honest i can barely do that so i thought hey why dont i go to one of those blow out bars and let them handle it apparently everyone had the same idea that day made a couple phone calls and everything was booked then it hit me i wonder if aveda does blow outs problem solved not only do they have blow outs on the menu but they are also only twelve dollars compare that to the pros who charge around i got a warm cup of tea when i arrived my stylist massaged my head with this awesome smelling oil then came my favorite part getting my hair washed when i win the lottery one day im going to hire someone to wash my hair for me every day its just the best feeling while she blow dryed and styled me i enjoyed watching all the students in action they have around people on the floor its quite an operation to watch i dont think i would ever get my hair colored or cut here but this is a steal for blow outs i would also like to go back and get a pedicure my girl lemuria c recommends getting some feet pampering done here pros cheap for a haircut or blow out cons carve out at least to hours the stylists are still students so they work under the direction of educators there are only a few of them on the floor and every student needs to have their work approved before and after parking is free in the garage behind the building but it can get full i feel like going to the aveda institute is a bit like playing roulette chances that you get an awesome stylist late in their training that does wonders to your hair or you get a total newb i really enjoyed the blow out that i had it was a total steal and looked great but it took forever my stylist was nice and did a great job but i ended up being late to the event i was getting styled for hour and mins from start to finish i dont know that i would ever take the gamble on getting my hair cut here but ill definitely be back for a blow out you cant beat the price and the attention took a little longer than expected but i think its because the students are so careful and detailed i personally like the extra time and attention you get from your stylist she listened to what i wanted and offered great advice its rare to get a great shampoo head massage haircut and styling for this cheap will go again you can not beat for a hair cut that includes a wash scalp and shoulder massage students work on your locks so dont expect hollywood and magazine cover results i highly recommend getting very basic styles and cuts here i went in for a trim and only expected a trim and that is what i got the service took about hrs since the stylist checks off a step by step list to go over with you before finalizing what they will be doing to your hair they also have to get their teachers approval throughout the whole process another thing to expect is that they are very pushy with the styling products they use and will glorify it as if they are heaven sent i just let them pitch it to me since i know they are being watched over and its part of their check list to do dont be snotty or mean they have the shears in their hands hah also be careful at checkout they also have the tendency to just start racking stuff in your basket as if youre going to buy every product they put in your hair the main entrance is behind the south blvd entrance where a parking garage is located directly across from it ill definitely come back for another trim thank you to lauren hawkins who gave me a fabulous haircut and beard trim today the aveda massage was incredible lauren was very helpful going over all my options for a change in hair styles she even showed me pics so of course i chose the george clooney look we discussed aveda natural based products and the aveda mission statement i really enjoyed the haircut and talking to lauren was fun aveda is a great place to get an excellent mans haircut at an really good price i know they are in training but they are well supervised and guys dont forget to tip your hard working stylist they deserve every penny i needed my hair styled for my sorority formal i thought going to a teaching salon would be a cheaper and less time consuming alternative than driving home to see my hair dresser the student i was assigned was running late so i had to wait about minutes until someone was available i took a picture of exactly what i wanted she asked several questions an i showed her exactly where i wanted the bun and told her i wanted a lot of volume the first time she finished my hair i asked is she could change a few things and she ended up redoing it the second time she could tell i still wasnt happy she said she didnt know how to fix it and asked me what she should do her supervisor came over and messed with my hair a little but i was still unhappy i paid went to my car cried and took a picture i sent the picture to my friends and family they said i should do it myself and that i shouldnt have paid for the horrible work the student did good place to get your hair did lower prices on service means more money for fabulous products i have gotten manicures pedicures facials eyebrow waxing haircut and color i mostly get my hair done here the other services take super long and the savings arent as good they do great eyebrow waxing thats worth the time so i normally get a haircut and root touch up i always try to get an advanced students and normally can get them if the appointment is booked in advanced the student talks about any concerns you may have and what they can do to address them then they tell you what they are going to do and confirm it with the teacher usually the teachers ask them a few questions and give them a little extra guidance aside from telling you what they are going to do they also let you know the cost and how long it will take pros they of course only use aveda products which smell so good the cost is great students stylist which know the latest and greatest second set of eyes on what you are getting done cost savings allows you to get more products never have an issue with parking cons student stylist which if you get someone that is new it can take extra long student stylist also means you wont be seeing the same person for too long the course is about months it can time a little bit longer depending on what you are getting done when i visited my daughter in new jersey who is a recognized colorist and stylist she approved my aveda cut a first the massage was great too nice view out the windows except watching the cop put a parking ticket on my car wasnt all that much fun seems my cut just went over hour i have been to aveda institutes in cincinnati and atlanta so i was already prepared for the amount of time it was going to take to get my haircut done i called the day of and was able to get in when i got there i had to wait about min and then was told thag the stylist i was scheduled to have was going to be another minutes so i had the option to go with someone else since it was my first visit i didnt really mind who i had i was sooo happy with the stylist i did get lauren n she did an awesome job and was very nice well i should have known at two points i tried to leave i went in for a full highlight and cut on thursday and for what was supposed to be gloss but ended up as toner i didnt know how to express what i wanted for color i wanted darker and richer we decided on warm base and ash blond which was a mistake the instructor guided the student and we came to an understanding this was my fault the reason for the low rating was that the process took hours and the foils took hours to apply pieces broke off the hair that the student advanced described as silky before the process is now fried the student said the color shuts off bleach i asked for not bleach she said all lighteners were the same bleach does not shut off i went to another salon today for a conditioner to repair the damage pieces broke off in their hands i now have chemically induced bangs where i had no bangs the aveda instructor only came by twice once in the beginning and once at the end the whole process has killed my hair the cut was a straight on blunt cut with no hair up like when we were kids the salon today fixed that with hair up and nice edges but couldnt resurrect the damage from the hour foil the reason for the long process was for exactness of placement but the damage wasnt worth decent striping and why i gave two stars considering it was a school the hair at the top is dark with white blond and the hair at the bottom is reddish yellow i blame the school and instructors they were everywhere but not helping the senior student there seemed to be only one instructor for many students and that instructor was resurrecting a cut from another student by doing it herself i am just shocked i used to go to the aveda institute in nyc and the instructors were there all the time and the cut and color were great the price in charlotte was very high especially for the horror wreaked on my hair its just really poor i would not recommend this salon go somewhere anywhere for the price and work you can do way way better note for the institute train instructors to visit each students station at least times train students to wash the bottom of the hair if the foiling takes too long the top is not finisheddone while the bottom is teach students not to do a blunt cut along the bottom teach students to watch the time and ask for help and please lower your high prices they shouldnt be half of normal but one fourth ive gotten haircuts and a pedicure here and they have been the best ones i have ever had usually when i got a haircut before i discovered aveda institute it was never what i wanted and always looked worse so i was really nervous about a student cutting my hair but the teacher comes before during and after your haircut which makes the experience a little longer hr but you know you are gonna look good after they really want to make you happy they also use the best aveda products and give you a hand massage and tea all for depends on the timeday you go great price and great haircut i would definitely recommend now the pedicure was awesome too it was only and lasted almost an hour and half great massage and exfoliation i loved all the products they used and they also let you keep the nail polish you choose they dont have a lot of color choices but maybe they switch them up every so often i am not sure our pedicures were done in a seperate quiet room and no massage chairs but the whole experience was way better than those rip off chinese nail salons i was not prepared for the amount of time it took but i would recommend this i was nervous at first to have the student retouch my expensive ombre but she did a fabulous job thank you sue i just had my first experience at the aveda institute and i loved loved loved it ambience and decor are warm and professional but what i enjoyed very much is the customer service i had my hair cut by dona a student that graduates in december master level shes such a pleasant person to interact with as she has been in the program for almost a year she had no problem giving me advice on what style looks good on me in the end it was a little bit shorter than we discussed and the instructor did have to go over it and make a few adjustments but even without those adjustments my hair would still look great and yes if you have any concerns definitely voice it out to your hairdresser and the instructor they would make sure youre happy with your end result ill definitely come back my mom and i have been going to aveda institute to years and we love it they have flexible hours the prices are fantastic and the service is always excellent beautiful salon plenty of products which is part of the reason i went super friendly staff with a parking garage behind the building thats free on south if you can believe it i explained to the person that took my appointment and to the master student and to the instructor that my hair takes more than volume and minutes to come down for the purple i wanted no one listened and sure enough after hours of double processing purple didnt hold i understand they are the experts instructors but theres this thing where ive had this hair for years and have been every color in the rainbow please take into consideration what the client tells you just had the best experience at this salon the teachers were all helpful and my stylist kayla will be an awesome addition to charlotte stylists hair nail and spa services performed by students at a discounted rate with superior products the aveda products are some of the best so that is the upside if you are going to get your hair done here take my advice call to book your apt and ask for a master student dont get anything crazy done stick to the basics plan to spend some time they need to check everything with the instructor so it slows the process down be very specific about what you want done manicures pedicures eye brow waxing and all hair services are available i had an amazing experience here ive always been hesitant to try new salons and this totally changed my mind savannah was awesome and the prices are great too awesome prices dollars for a cut color and blow dry still on the fence if its worth it had a master student so paid a little more but she struggled to choose a color and really my hair is pretty much black not too hard to figure out just needed to color my natural highlights color ended up being too light and on the right side missed an area completely plus i asked for a very minimal trim which means the layers but i got inch nipped of the length instead nice young lady great atmosphere but pretty much got a great clips service this is my second time getting a cut and color by the student medha she is flat out amazing i am beyond picky about my hair and she really could not have done a better job i came in for a cut and blow dry this was a pretty simple cut a re shape with a trim i have been to other aveda institutes before and been thrilled this was my first time at the charlotte one my cut and blow dry took an hour and fourty five minutes way too long in addition the cut was painful i have never had a painful haircut before but she must have been pulling my hair taught when trimming or something because i could feel every strand being yanked the cut itself did not look good when she was done and it took multiple other people to come and fix it if this were not a student albeit one at the end of their program i would give this one star im disappointed as i had hoped to be a returning customer but i dont think i can be after this i came in for a cut and blow dry this was a pretty simple cut a re shape with a trim i have been to other aveda institutes before and been thrilled this was my first time at the charlotte one my cut and blow dry took an hour and fourty five minutes way too long in addition the cut was painful i have never had a painful haircut before but she must have been pulling my hair taught when trimming or something because i could feel every strand being yanked the cut itself did not look good when she was done and it took multiple other people to come and fix it if this were not a student albeit one at the end of their program i would give this zero stars im disappointed as i had hoped to be a returning customer but i dont think i can be after this got a shampoo and blow dry by molly best blow dry ive ever had i love this place blowouts for less that sign me up ive gotten many blowouts facials and a cut and id say of the time the services are fantastic ive been to other schools and they just arent as nice and the students here seem to know what they are doing or at least theyre good at putting on a professional face well first off i love aveda products as far as the institute meh i have tried this place multiple times something always goes wrong on this last adventure only went out of a last min emergency my appointment was at i dont mind waiting the few min but i didnt get anyone until almost pm the positives i have never gotten such great customer service there before usually the ppl at the front are meh but that day they were yah the girlie who cut my hair was adorable very much had to make sure my trim was exactly what i wanted horrible experience i just left after hours with four hair colors on my head the student was a master student named calvin his instructor anee said she could recommend a good saloon that can fix it i said after hours i only want out and that i hope they will not charge me for this anee accompanied me to the cash register where she left me and apparently told the guy at the check out to charge me after looking at my hair he voided it i left and i am curious if i will receive a bill in the mail looking at my hair i want to cry i need to find someone who can fix this now first let me start off by saying yes i understand they are students and they are learning but some things in my opinion are just common sense im not a hair stylist but i know its not right to brush someones hair and tug at it like youre in a rush i came in for a shampoo and blow out i have curly long hair and i had people brushing and tugging at my hair at once like it was some kind of race and i told them to please brush my hair more gently im not trying to have my hair pulled out or damaged then they both proceeded to blow dry my hair and my hair got caught around the one persons brush really bad and i heard her say to the other person were not supposed to be using these brushes and i confronted her about it and said why are you using it then and she said i didnt mean it like that long story short the instructor finished blowing out my hair and it came out ok in my opinion i booked an appointment with a mid level student but he seemed less than that im just happy i didnt get a haircut there i wont be returning to aveda tried to sit with my wife as she was getting her pedicure and the mod came over to ask me to leave saying i cant sit there due to lack of room when neither me nor my wife wee in anyway in other peoples area not to mention us having a nice conversation with the student it wasnt bothering anyone and if it wasnt taking hrs then perhaps i wouldnt feel the need to go hang with her but it was and still is if youre trying to teach these kids on become stylists then you need to also teach them customer service along with not every situation is the same and that you may need to deal with different clientele with different requests and needs despite your un posted policy you may want to take in the situation and take notice to see if it is bothering other customers or the students for what each customer pays there needs to be a more understanding quite annoyed and im sure this falls on def andor uncaring earseyes ive never gone to a school before for a cut because i have very thick hair and have had my professional haircuts end up looking like a mushroom head but i just moved around the corner and thought id give it a shot three hours later i walked out with a cut that requires me to visit another salon to get fixed tomorrow three people assisted my stylist during this visit and somehow i still walked out with split ends and a less than fresh looking cut i understand that this is a school and that it might take longer and may not come out perfect however in three hours to not have a decent or at least acceptable cut is disheartening i honestly hope this isnt the case for all that visit here but i wont be back i have been going here for a while and was always happy recently i went for highlights and was greatly disappointed i asked for my usual partial foil but asked them to retouch up my gray roots with a color i told them i use a clairol n in between highlight appointments i asked for it a little lighter in the front of my face the stylist named raye used a much darker color and put the dye all over my entire head roots only which i never asked her to do now my hair looks darker and i went with the intention of getting it lighter i called to see what they could do for me maybe just give me a few more foils in the front like i had asked in the first place the lady on the phone said that it was past the hour period but she would put the request in and someone would call back either way and let me know no one bothered calling me back im never going here again poor customer service ive come to the aveda school a couple times i have long straight hair nothing extreme medium texture no complicated layers no overly specific requests for the stylists each time unfortunately my hair has been cut unevenly and nothing like discussed i am confident it has been a fluke as ive seen outstanding work while im in there my last experience seemed to be going really well the student was friendly and detail oriented as she had never done a cut like mine long layers the educator stopped by as she competed each step the educator planned to come by to cut the layers and do some framing once the student did the preliminary work and dried my hair after my hair was dried a different educator came by to check everything before i left i wasnt shown my hair prior to being walked up to check out as they were trying to close up for the night i hadnt realized i didnt get to see my hair before leaving once home i realized my hair was still damp and my layers were never trimmed my hair looks like a choppy fluff i am so sad not to love my cuts because the students have consistently offered friendly customer service they did a really good job ill be back in a few weeks for a touch up front desk hallie was great computers were down but she handled finding our appt so nicely both my mother i came to get color and trim my mother highlights kirby was great pleasant friendly when we spoke about the things the school taught her like colors cut the hair business and even her knowledge on nutrition and diversity in hair varieties she was well educated and versed my hair color feels great my color is awesome my trim is flawless plus she blow dried my hair perfectly i wish her the best kirbys definitely some ill keep in touch with by going to modern spa aveda friendly yaaa love these products in huntersville by birkdale where she plans to begin her career xoxoxoxo from reading the previous reviews one thing i have to remind all the future guests off is that aveda is a school these are students that are learning so everyone may not have the same experience this was my first time at aveda and i loved it my appt was at pm and i left at pm pretty good timing for my thick hair i cant wait to go back for the cost its worth it for me with a shampoo and style wow it was nice to be heard by the stylist and then to see my head of thick hair streamlined into a classic but manageable style manageable in that the humdity wont find me looking like bozo the clown love the aveda products and loved my experience today i have been here times once was for a simple trim once was to fix a botched hair cut turned out nice and the other was just a few days ago and the student who is set to graduate in a week butchered my hair things i heard from the supervisor who came to check her work after politely expressing i was not happy and its shorter than what i asked and in fact too short to even fix its not as bad as you think it is it will grow out and you didnt have a lot of hair to work with just to clarify i used to have enough hair to work with it was to my shoulders and now one side is above my jawline and can barely tuck behind my ear and the back looks like a little boys bowl cut who kept holding his head sideways not only that i asked for my hair to be toned to cool down the warmth my hair was blonde and walked out with muddy brown hair that has a greenish tint in some light several phone calls and emails to the school for a refund and corrective color have gone unanswered i left crying and im not a cryer update they called and are going to correct the color and in a few months correct the cut great for a basic cut and trim i usually only get an inch or two taken off of my hair with a few layers and all of my cuts have turned out great i think the fact that there is a trainer who is constantly reviewing the students work helps a ton also love the complimentary neck massage that they give you at the beginning of the appointment with their oils its amazing at for a cut shampoo and style its a steal my only negatives would be how slow the entire process usually takes two hours for a trim and shampoo is too long i usually booked appointments early saturday afternoons when i first started going i quickly learned this was a mistake as i was waiting min past my scheduled appointment time just to be seen due to over scheduling i presume the last time i went i scheduled my appointment for early saturday morning so that i could be the first customer that my stylist had for the day and that seemed to work better i was seen within minutes of arriving and left an hr and a half later overall i think its a great value but i would be prepared to be there for a while with a lot of idle downtime well it is true you get what you pay for i came here last week to get some highlights spent two hours playing the game of lets try to put the foil on the clients hair walked out looking no better than when i walked in mind you i have golden blond hair those highlights should have been there so back i went the next day for another two hours and yep the hair is lighter all over no highlights no lowlights just light so i guess its back to the high end folks at least i will get what i asked for and perhaps better customer service you see the institute does a good job bringing in these students taking their money teaching them to maybe cut and color hair but thats about it no customer service training evident my chick had the personality of a wash rag half the time she sang off key the other half she was poking me in the eye with her tools or with her hands its too bad really since i had never had such bad service there before but the amount of time i had to spend there was not worth the price tag i wont even waste time running in to get product i can order that through the mail and they are always happy to throw in a freebie i have been having a shampoo and style by two student stylists for several months they do an excellent job they listen carefully to what you want and style it perfectly they are well trained and professional barb the students staff at aveda are all super nice and sweet they make each client feel comfortable and they do great work i got my hair and makeup done for prom and i turned out great the price wasnt bad either i got tired of paying for a mens haircut at the various mens salons around town so my wife recommended this place and i tried it today for a side fade and hard part overall i was pleased with the experience given that it wasnt a mens salon with hot towels hot neck shaves and massages the experience was different mainly because its a school with the instructor having to come by and check on the student whos cutting your hair during the initial consultation after the instructor heard how i wanted my hair cut she paused and awkwardly said well um this is going to be a bit of a challenge great i thought well all it meant was that the instructor did more of the cutting than i would imagine she would normally have to do oh well no biggie the shampoo and conditioner smelled like ginger the style and finished product looked great and for plus tip im a happy man oh and guys theres no complimentary beer but you do get a dixie cup of water when you arrive so thats exciting}

{52988, Prince Restaurant, 6795 W Flamingo Rd Ste A Las Vegas NV 89103, what a gem when youre homesick and want some home made food the cevapi are great and the service very friendly and homey cute and quaint its friday im starving in my room after playing the secret world for hrs i decided to check yelp for something different ive found this little niche near my place without pics and decided ive give it proper pictures we all know without pics were not going i parked in the back because driving by in the afternoon sunset was difficult to see really must pay attention the restaurant is cozy clean and the manager who greeted me was friendly along with the staff since this is the first time being in a serbian i asked to try their traditional foods stuffed cabbagebeef rice and no tomatoes cucumber salad with tomato and feta cheese and cordon bleubaked stuffed porkhomemade cheese and ham with sour creme along with a special homemade dipping saucebell peppers tomato garlic all hand chopped and cooked really long to make it pasty and puree appetizers are around ish and entrees are about ish overall the stuffed cabbage and cordon bleu hit the spot anyways check out the pics and if you want to try some european serbian food this is the spot stars meets my standards for cleanliness atmosphere and the only serbian restaurant i know out there so i cannot compare came here with a friend last night food was real good better than aok dont know if ill go back but wouldnt rule it out pros food was tasty service was good price was great but cons smoking inside restaurant is gross the say its mediterranean food but not like paymons its more like bosnian or serbian food amazing the cevapcici sausages are out of this world best i ever had outside of europe by far fresh bread a bottle of karlovacka beer and great service how can you loose very authentic serbian cuisine place is a little small but most hole in the wall places offer the best food and prince is no exception must try the cevape so delicious if you love european or serbian food this is gonna nv to be your new favorite spot great mediterranean cuisine yugoslavian food i ordered for the small meat plate for one person with pork steak cevapcici pljeskavica sausages french fries ajvar and salat it was good and much meat i live in the la area and whenever im in vegas i make sure to stop here for some serbian food is it authentic no but good luck getting that outside of chicago its as authentic as youre going to get in the western united states and im a big fan i love their karaoreva snicla and burek the cevapi are ok not as good as aroma cafe in la but still good my girlfriend not serbian has had the govei gulas and sarma and she seemed to like both i tried both and they were good though not as good as my moms and dedas cooking d the service has been great here every time ive gone much better than my one experience at the other serbian establishment in vegas cafe derbi on that note all the smoke is a legitimate concern and not for everybody but having been to serbia many times and not being a smoker myself i guess you could say im used to it still this place is way more ventilated than derbi even if its smaller so if youre worried about smoke while youre eating and rightfully so this is the better option i love me some prince ill be back next time im in vegas vidimo se d princes is right around the corner from where i live but id never seen it before a friend took me and my fiancee out last night we got there a little early so i pulled up the yelp reviews and i was worried about all the smoke that was mentioned but looking forward to some great food we walked in and its a dark little spot with a bar set up in the corner and a handful of tables it was a little smokey and you are allowed to smoke inside it wasnt bad though and im very sensitive to excess smoke but it really wasnt awful our serverbartender was awesome offering recommendations and checking up on us frequently for drinks the guys had a shot of a serbian brandy which i was too scared to try i had a fresh squeezed orange juice with lemon drink that was awesome i actually had two my fella had an orangina which was like a non alcoholic mimosa sparkling water with oj type of taste for appetizer we had sarma which is lamb rice and spices wrapped in cabbage i would eat this all day every day it was wonderful and the portion was enough for three of us the boys got salads with tomatoes and cucumbers which i hate so i wasnt a fan but if you like these kind of salads youd probably enjoy it the bread basket was great as well the bread was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside just wonderful and went well in the sauce of the sarma for the entrees i had cevapi sausage sandwich with homemade bread onions and a buttersour cream type sauce the sausage is veal and beef and was very flavorful not sure that i enjoyed it on the bread because it fell a part a little but i loved all of the individual aspects of the dish my fella had makedonska pljeskavica ground steak stuffed w mozzarella ham mushroom and cream cheese spread on house made bread this was enormous i thought it was pretty tasty but he wasnt fond of the cream cheese filling the meat seemed to be more of a gyro meat consistency which again he didnt care for i loved it though and thought it was great my friend had karaoreva snicla pork loin schnitzel stuffed with mozzarella cheese cream cheese and ham rolled and breaded fries slaw this was the best entree and i dont like port lol it was really tender and delicious portions were generous for the price i have every intention of coming back and frequently the best way i can describe prince is by calling it a dive bar with greasy ukranianserbian food except in a good way the decor and atmosphere are nonexistent but the staff are friendly and the food is good they have a full bar and indoor smoking patio seating available if youre not a fan majority of the clientele here are from europe so dont get offended when youre asked where youre from its not meant in a rude way but dont be a stereotypical boring american diner and get the shish kabob ask for a recommendation or pick something from the specialty entrees section and prepare to be impressed i opted for the makedonska pljeskavica which is a gyro like meat stuffed with mozzarella ham mushrooms and cream cheese between two slices of soft oily bread definitely split this order as its a giant portion and unhealthy add a shopska salad to lighten things up cucumber pepper tomato and feta with a vinegar oil dressing one of the best delicious food and lovely stuff team i am there all the time breakfast lunch diner voffee thank you sta reci nego svaka cast jedan ste od bolji restorana bio sam u utah arizona i california ali vi ste najbolji ukusna hrana ljubazno osoblje my curiosity is piqued every time i find a rare balkan cuisine spot and i make trying their food and testing the ambiance for authenticity a priority this restaurant is the size of an average cafe and kept dark and cool most days the bar at the end is typically occupied by a lot of gruff affable balkan expats watching sports and smoking something we could see but not smell from our spot due to what i assume is excellent ventilation dont let the size of the venue fool you they serve up some serious grub the sopska salata was fresh delicious and spot on the sarma was beautifully constructed but the kisela kupus had tastetexture of having been frozen not that big of a deal the sampling of beers and spirits from the region was wonderful and punctated a great walk down memory lane we left so full and happy that we cant wait to come back i come here every time im in vegas from la and its hands down the best serbian food on the west coast i recommend the pljeskavica a serbian kebab burger with kajmak its large and delicious serbs do meat right the service is good and polite and did not wait too long for the food p s not sure why people are mentioning ukrainian there is nothing ukrainian in this restaurant had been wanting to try this place for a couple years and it was well worth the wait the service is very good what you would expect at a european cafe attentive but not overbearing leisure atmosphere i was glad they had karlovacko on the drinks menu even though they did not have any in stock we still enjoyed a nektar beer its so hard to find these beers in vegas we both had the mixed meat plate first let me say as expected the portions are enough for people we could have easily shared a plate between the two of us but we were looking forward to taking leftovers home it comes with cevapcici pork steak pljeskavica and additional meats salat pomfrit and a basket of kruh everything was cooked to perfection it wasnt the best cevapcici but it captured the overall flavor looking forward to coming back while my family and i enjoyed our lunch the downside is that this small restaurant doesnt have a designated smoking area we ordered beef spinach and cheese burek french fries and cevape everything was delicious and the server was attentive but we ate inhaling unwelcome secondhand smoke from other tables probably we wont come back we never miss a visit to prince when we are in vegas best cevapi and palacinke food was awful heated up frozen pitas and cevapi that smell so bad even after walking miles and starving we could not eat the food there save your money and go to in n out instead you will have better food and service terrible experience i will never come back and neither will any of our friends and would definitely not recommend to anyone}
{13701, First Watch, 61 W. Thomas Road Phoenix AZ 85013, one word bacado bacon avocado and cheese in an omelet seems common place but no other restaurant does it so well breakfast and brunch only when i was younger i thought first watch was a local restaurant that started at this location because they had several menu items with hospital themed names and with some of my family working at the hospital it seemed like it must have been created just for them i was dashed to find out it wasnt true this is still my favorite first watch location and i thnk should be listed somewhere as best place to choke on your ham or best place to meet a single dr or something because its littered with hospital staff not that theres anything wrong with that i love everything on the menu i love how fresh everything tastes and how healty it almost all seems i didnt realize the limits of the menu until i went there for breakfast with someone who doenst eat eggs wow there goes of the menu not that a breakfastlunch place has to have tons of non egg options but if someone is looking for an alternative its pretty much just pancakes or order something from the lunch menu service has always been good though rushed at times wonder if any of these folks are just working here to meet the drs of their mothers dreams could be interesting to find out a previous reviewer mentioned ihop and dennys right on might as well mention lepeep and other bland vanilla overcrowded restaurants too all i will say is this until youve had a waitress dripping with sweat dripping deliver your food you cant complain so i guess we can complain grow up go someplace real first watch is always a reliable place to hit after a night of binging or a moderate bout of dysentery as you can always expect the food to be bland but healthful barely anything on the menu is slathered in grease which is a nice change from some of fws competitors im not totally slamming the place i actually like the combos they offer in terms of the sweet savory equilibrium thats so important to me when breakfast is concerned the retirement home style pastels are soothing too you might expect dorothy rose and blanche to sit down in the booth next to you at any moment a big fw plus is that generous seating ensures that there are barely any times when you have to wait to be seated for breakfast or lunch so if you cant get a seat at nearby matts big breakfast or the park central good egg consider this egg joint ive been times it think last time was yesterday ok so the good some good creative menu choices ah a fajitas crepe was interesting bad bugs on table straw wrapper in water star traditional food eggs benedick terribly bland and different food that fajita crepe thing also not good star hours um close at pm i give points for havening long hours and good food this place has neither star it not the worst but i cant recommend it anymore i really like this place for breakfast there is almost never a wait for a table even on saturday morning the food and service is reliable there are some healthy options on the menu as well as some very not healthy options which we all sometimes need and want for breakfast one of my close friends introduced me to this restaurant years ago as it is downtown it was awfully out of my way to go again but i always thought of it fondly now that i am only minutes from downtown i think i will be getting here more often im almost glad that there are several poor reviews on yelp because it secures my ability to wander in and get a table whenever i please ive eaten there many times nice people good food they give you your own pitcher of water carafe of coffee very nice touches reasonable prices my co worker and i were driving around phoenix looking for an ihop and stumbled upon first watch good thing we did because it was well worth the breakfast stop considering their reasonable prices good variety free pitcher of coffee at our table and very friendly service i had something called a crepegg which is a thin sweet crepe combined with fluffy whipped eggs it kind of tastes like an omelet but not really since it has the crepe batter in it but my key west crepe was very satisfying with avocado bacon smoked turkey tomatoes and monterey jack cheese i did also want to try the banana crunch with granola pancake but you can only eat so much in one sitting as far as chain breakfast spots go this isnt half bad id pick it over the good egg for decor alone which is much less country kitchen and more well this location looks kind of strange its like walking into an s after school soda fountain shaped like a der wienerschnitzel the food not mind blowing but well above average too the eggs are cooked just right and i happen to think the fresh veggies in the omelettes are about as crisp and tasty as youre going to find the coffee is on par with dennys so take that for what its worth ill take this over an ihop any day thats for sure first watch is good for a light breakfast as they really dont pile on the food the food is good though and the service is good too this place reminds me of a more refined dennys run of the mill breakfast spot you wouldnt be missing out on much if you never ate here and i only came here because the place i really wanted to get breakfast at had an hour wait i couldnt find any breakfast item that looked particularly appetizing so i went with the buffalo chicken wrap my gf ordered the choco chip pancake and a side of scrambled eggs and ham food came out nothing special taste and looks wise my buffalo chicken wrap was overloaded with lettuce and lacked a suitable amount of chicken the buffalo sauce was different than any ive ever had and wasnt very spicy the bleu cheese crumbles were good though i ordered a side of bleu cheese dressing and it came out looking like mayo i dont know if i can ever eat bleu cheese after that my gfs pancake was a ok nothing really stood out our sever was awesome though everyone inside was very friendly i appreciate good service well the food may have been a little closer to the mediocre side but the service was great i had what my gf always says as a boring breakfast chocolate chip pancakes and a side of ham and an egg the pancake was a little dry but the ham was pretty good coffee was average eggs were average but they did have some decent things on the menu i do like that they brought out an entire carafe of coffee and water so i dont get stuck paying bucks for a tiny cup o joe w no refill or trying to flag someone down for one nice but our server was great she apologized for the oj spilled all down the side of her previous to our visit it did look bad though lol when i went to pay they were the guy asked me how everything was and what i had planned today i sincerely appreciate people who enjoy their job and make your experience enjoyable in short service stars food stars we used to go here every sunday but something happened a few months ago and all of a sudden the wait staff turned over and the service just went to crap the manager did buy us breakfast once and encouraged us to return and we did then the stupidity just multiplied like bunnies and rats food is good but the staff just does not seem to give a darn about you getting your drinks or food dont waste your time phoenix downtowners go to good egg nice respectable breakfast place near encanto park it has a basic chain brunch place feel but with the friendly servers somehow it seemed a bit more homey seats are basic wooden booths and the inside seems a bit cooler and darker than youd expect for a bright phoenix morning the menu is basic breakfast fare and i had a version of the denver omelette with english muffins on the side there was also a potato side that came with it for the life of me i believe it was homefries but im not obviously it wasnt too memorable but i thought everything here was at least average prices were reasonable and they dropped a coffee canteen at my table and even refilled it when i had drank the whole thing for easy access so not a meal that youll remember for the rest of your life but there wont be any nightmares here either we made a trip to first watch on the way to the airport to take our daughter so she could catch a flight to texas i know what you are thinking why would anyone want to go to texas on purpose she really does have a good reason so off we went we walked in and they seated us right away our waitress promptly greeted us and took our drink order she introduced herself as lindsay and i am sure she is not the milkoholic lindsay from the e trade commercial she did a great job for us our food came out quickly and it was quite tasty lindsay checked on us quite a few times as we ate and refreshed our drinks we will be returning for another visit the valley needs more places that have a good to great breakfast friendly fast service and great food neighborhood favorite eggs overcooked oj watery but tasty food not greasy or oily everything just a little bit healthier than youll find elsewhere food is great service has always been slow even when the restaurant is not busy havent been back in months however the last times i have gone the service has been much quicker so i increase from stars to and downtown location is across the street from golds gym downtown so i may frequent much more this place is just fine you will have a decent breakfast their coffee is great they have lots of different flavored creamers and the food is fine we got tired of paying for breakfast at the big named hotels across the street we tried this place out and never ate at the hotels again even if the boss was paying certainly worth a trip if youre stuck in downtown for a few days a coworker of mine selected this restaurant as her birthday lunch destination when i offered to treat and what the birthday girl wants the birthday girl gets so off we went this was literally my first watch i had never even heard about this place until she mentioned it the inside is just as some other reviewers have pointed out very cafeteria like yet still cheerfully bright it definitely gives off a good day sunshine breakfast vibe we sat down in a not so comfortable cafeteria style booth and i began to scan the menu the options looked decent but boring and spanned the spectrum of usual omelet egg bacon pancake griddle wrap sandwich and salad dishes first watch also has the healthier side a portion of their menu dedicated to those watching their waistline i thought that was a nice touch the coffee tasted like warm water with brown food coloring in it very unimpressive i ordered the no an asian salad with chicken romaine lettuce yuck wontons cashews cilantro and carrots with the ginger sesame dressing on the side this salad was not impressive at all and it needed more toppings to combat the bland romaine lettuce i just picked at it throughout the entire meal the birthday girl ordered the black n blue wrap roast beef blue cheese tomato lettuce and horseradish sauce wrapped up in a spinach tortilla she was impressed with her meal so maybe i should have gotten a wrap instead however i probably wont go back for my second watch to find out overall first watch is decent the service is fast yet friendly and the food is mediocre the breakfasty brunchy lunchy menu was a step up from an ihop or dennys because first watchs food isnt as greasy so if i had to compare i would say first watchs menu resembles the good eggs menu although i think that the good eggs food quality presentation and flavor is much better if youre looking for a breakfast place open early in that general area i suggest you drive a little further up central to the park central shopping center and hit up the good egg in my opinion their salads are tastier and their coffee is stronger i happen to really like this place for breakfeast i have been going to this location and the other location for years and always happy with my meal i used to get the bubbas benny which is biscuits and gravy with eggs and potatoes but now they make it with turkey sausage so i dont get it anymore now i get the eggs benidict its good and the hollandaise sauce doesnt have a lot of lemon in it im not a fan of lots of lemon in my hollandaise the waffles and french toast here are good as well this place has burgers salads and sandwiches to prices are good i dont think they have anything over on the menu i ate there for the first time on sat morning and it was soo good we went back on sunday morning i love their food its so healthful compared to other breakfast spots in the area and the prices are comparable nice sized parking lot friendly staff i mean its just average lots of old people lots of regulars i wish i could give stars solely for our waitress in fact im going to write the manager to tell them about our awesome waitress seriously who cares about the food i want to be her bffl she was so damn nice apparently everyone loves her bc the regular oldies were hugging her and she knew them all by name i have never had such a great waitress for sure the best ever the food was neither here nor there just typical breakfast stuff but i would go back just to hang out with my new bffl i wish i knew her name but if you go here just ask for the blonde girl that everyone loves you will love her too and you will also want to be her bffl we went here for breakfast last weekend and i was pleasantly surprised the coffee is there own brand and it has a great flavor i especially like that they have a bunch of different flavored creamers the staff is very friendly and efficient you can tell this is the type of place that has regulars i also like that they have both breakfast and lunch items to choose from i had the key west crepe egg the crepe egg is a mixture between a thin crepe and whipped eggs and it was stuffed with turkey bacon avocado tomatoes and probably some other goodies it came with hash browns and an english muffin my husband had the traditional breakfast which is pretty much what it sounds like overall i would recommend first watch because its a great breakfast at a good price with friendly staff i used to come here quite often and really enjoyed it however something happened and they really went down hill i went there again about weeks ago after not going there for years and it was really good so we went there again this week again really good the food has greatly improved everything once again was delicious and the service was fantastic i am so glad that they got it together again they are only open for breakfast and lunch but i love that they are right here in the neighborhood first watch is a local chain that serves up average breakfast food this place isnt terrible but it is also not remarkable in any way the booths are made of slotted wood and for some reason they havent been updated in years resulting in sub par seating that will leave horizontal lines on anyone wearing shorts the food is ok not exciting or great just ok the coffee is bad it looks like coffee but tastes like brown water additionally they dont have fresh halfhalf they have the little individual cups similar to circle k for this visit the huge downfall was the service i wont describe this person because i dont want any harm coming to her job but if our server wasnt on meth then i dont like cupcakes hint i love cupcakes the server was jittery confused and racing around unnecessarily making things more annoying the booth near us apparently had some of the servers friends dining and they were so loud i thought i was at a club when we were seated the server yelled over to us asking us for a drink order for the next ten minutes she sat with her pals and cackled about something they were watching on a smart phone it was sketchy too because they started talking pretty loudly about sex acts and other things that arent the best fit when there are tables of kids within five feet i have a great sense of humor but am on a saturday isnt the best time to get cheeky at breakfast in a different restaurant they might politely ask the people who are yelling loudly and having inappropriate conversations to dial it down but here the server was sitting with them and was part of it interestingly all the other staff we encountered were very nice and appropriate but our server was so poor that it just couldnt save the outing our food was brought to us by a lovely server who we wished would have been ours from the start after our food was brought out our server never stopped by again it was funny however that she had to walk by our table five times to go back and sit with her friends and cackle some more but couldnt stop to see if we needed more water yes luckily my dining pal has a sense of humor and just rolled her eyes but i would be livid if i brought my mom etc there in closing i cannot recommend this place for a meal its not terrible but with the economy being so sketchy its nice to spend money somewhere that is comfortable and where youre not ignored or served by someone who likely cannot pass a drug test i took my dad here for breakfast when he came into town for the morning i actually took him here based solely on the location because it was close to my house the food is ok i had the traditional breakfast with scrambled eggs turkey sausage and potatoes the egg were just ok didnt really have flavor and were kind of dry i wonder do they add milk to their eggs if youre looking for a delicious cafediner type of breakfastlunch place with good prices then go to first watch in midtown phoenix the food and coffee and is fantastic ive never had a bad meal their probably one of my favorite places to go for eggs benedict every server ive ever had there has been on point and smiling i thought it was surprisingly cheap for how good the food was lots of variety and choices on the menu easy access and plenty of parking very consistent place for breakfast with the kids pancakes are always terrific and i like that i can order a single pancake theyre huge if youre eating a stack of these be prepared for a nap servers are always super friendly and very attentive if the place isnt jammed kids meals are a terrific deal nice that they have flavored creamers to go with the coffee not as funky flavorful as matts big breakfast but no wait and a lot cheaper first watch offers the standard american breakfasts its good stuff what i noticed about this restaurant is the consumer service alberts customer service skills are second to none dude asked me what my name was shook my hand and referred to me by my first name every time he came by to see how i was doing i recommend this restaurant i am totally in love with their fresh brewed mango iced tea it is really good their food is more on the healthy side and offers some choices that are not on most breakfastlunch spots i have tried their eggs benedict with turkey avocado and it was wonderful the turkey here tastes fresh roasted and is sliced super thin also had their waffle wow its light fluffy and not too sweet comes with hot syrup and a fruit compote service here is excellent all around even when they are super busy i will be back here again and again its bland old white people food if you like that sort of thing sort of like a more pricey version of dennys other than the atmosphere i dont have too much positive to say about first watch the eggs were disgusting they were bright yellow and had the most bizarre texture you would have thought they were feeding the chickens fabric softener i had a carrot cake pancake which i thought was a pretty clever idea unfortunately it was multi grain let me tell you a multi grain carrot cake pancake is just a bit too much going on for me the service was fair but far from great overall far from a wow i wouldnt go out of my way to come back stars i was shocked to see the low ratings about first watch we have been here dozens of times and the food and service have always been top notch it is consistently great i will continue to support this great breakfast and lunch spot special recognition to the servers everyone is so friendly positive and laid back every weekend i come to first watch and the service is always outstanding i usually have one of two regular waitresses and they are always so nice and cheerful the food is always good and quickly served if you want a decent breakfast in a nice happy environment then go here im here pretty regularly for a breakfast meeting so ive grown pretty well acquainted with the joint if i were rating it on service alone itd be a solid stars the waitstaff are always attentive and friendly have answered questions i didnt even ask thank you psychic bathroom directions buddy and know the menu well they dont even bat an eye at special requests no matter what size group we end up having the servers and the kitchen both cope well too which is always rad the food alas isnt as standout awesome as the service its not bad by any means its edible and tastes good and comes out at the appropriate temperature the menus got a great variety its just not anything to write home about if you asked me where can i get a reliably decent breakfast first watch would be at the top of the heap if you want a mind blowingly amazing breakfast not so much its a healthy breakfast all day looking joint remind me of sunrise cafe in vegas very friendly service and prompt definitely a good spot to go solid place to grab a classic breakfast nice selection with seasonal choices had the pumpkin pancakes with some herbal tea fresh food attentive staff and boy is it fast i like the skillets and theyll sub out my toast for fruit which is nice i never feel like i ate heavy sticky icky food when i leave and i like that every single employee you encounter interacts with you with a big ol smile on their face there is one wait person who is a little ditzy and i try to avoid her like the plague but overall i am very impressed with this place not a greasy diner no siree tasty id eat lunch here sometime too but their gluten free lunch options are just about non existent i wish theyd change that the staff is super friendly and helpful the food is great and out quickly coffee is always hot tasty this is our go to breakfast spot plus you can sub almost anything including egg whites for no extra charge theyre very accommodating especially for those of us who have to eat gluten free so happy we found first watch my go to place when i want plenty of breakfast options little waiting time to be seated no matter how full it looks like it is ive only had to wait to be seated once that took all of minutes this is a breakfast lunch restaurant is not open for diner i must confess no matter what time ive been i always have breakfast so thats all i can review d my favorite omelet is new on their menu the ce la vie its roasted zucchini onions and tomatoes with herbed goat cheese it comes with just the right amount of potatoes and an english muffin i always switch out the muffin for wheat toast when im ravenous i want something a little heavier i like the bacon and onion hash the staff is always so friendly our waitress always remembers us even when shes not our waitress good breakfasts options they have your classics and some tasty healthy alternatives too great place for breakfast and a cup of coffee the ladies here are amazing and super nice they bring out my food in a timely manner and the eggs benedict there are to die for during the fallwinter season they have a specials menu that was delicious if they still have it i recommend trying the pulled pork sandwich and the butternut squash soup meals are reasonable priced and if you go online and subscribe to their newsletter you get a buy one get one entree coupon for your next visit and you get a free entree on your birthday this place never disappoints yummy as always i had the turkey chive crepe eggs it was great i wish they still had the california delight on the menu that was my favorite this is the location nearest my work and i was surprised to get a parking spot and a table with no wait it is right across from st joes and it is always packed but apparently is the time to go darn i gave away the secret great healthy breakfast i love this place i had sourdough french toast with kiwi strawberries bananas and blueberries with a side of eggs for an egg really i can buy a dozen for that much anyway pricy eggs aside it was so delicious i ate the entire thing even every last crumb of fruit i loved it it was reasonably priced i got unlimited tea refills and the server was just the cutest thing ive ever seen it was like a very very nice and quaint version of dennys in terms of layout not a lot of trendy indie stuff or whatever but i loved it this is a breakfast lunch place that used to be beyond great we really loved coming here many years ago the same people worked here and it was always a pleasure to come in food was wonderful and so was the service then things started to change the food was not as good they changed the menu up then the staff started to change when you start losing all the staff you have had for so many years something is not right inside the company the service and food really went downhill so we stopped coming here well lately i have been back xs things are better they are trying but it is still not the same however service is fast again and they do check on you all the time food is working it self back up the hill maybe they should fo more organic or something it is still a good place just not what it was whenever i come to first watch i feel like im going to a little diner the service is great and the food is great too they have a great selection of egg white omelets that you can choose from my favorite thing about first watch is that they leave you the whole pot of coffee at your table the turkey sausage and egg white omelet is really good while if you are in the area and when some breakfast you should come here it is definitely better then ihop or dennys amazing food and great staff try the banana blitz if it is still around when you go tried this place for the first time this morning and it exceeded all ny expectations im not usually the diner type but the quality of food and commitment top great service will have me back here on a regular basis best breakfastbrunch place since i lived in palo alto in the s different types of dishes whole grains which i love great service not cheap but worth it every chance i get to eat here i do i wish there was one in tucson i order the same thing everytime i love the killer cajun i went to first watch for first time and will not be back i ordered the chickichanga the potatoes were burned i also feel like they were frozen potatoes the chicken i had inside felt like rubber and tasted just like frozen tyson chicken i felt like i was on an episode of restaurant impossible where i had to taste and criticize the terrible food the service was not as wonderful as everyone is saying yes they were nice but thats all the host sat us in the very back of the restaurant when there was clearly room towards the front for us to sit it took at least min for anyone to come to us after we got our food about min later the waitress brought our bill it felt as if they were trying to rush us out but by then i was disgusted by the food i honestly was ready but hey the water was good what a great place to eat food was great i had the eggs benedict and had a special request to add spinach to it they said no problem was very good portions just right very good had the lunch fer combo turkey sandwich and pecan salad both were amazing i added on a cup of tomato bisque that i used for dipping the sandwich in delish came to first watch after a bad experience with the good egg x better unlike other places the food isnt greasy and doesnt give me a stomach ache afterwards lots of options and you can order breakfast or lunch any time of the day our waitress told us if we can do it we will she even let us order the turkey dill crepegg even though its not on the menu any more i will keep coming here i recommend it any day im just bummed they close at it was ok i guess i had the huevos rancheros hubby had the traditional breakfast for me the beans tasted like canned beans the tortilla tasted store bought like mission tortillas the chorizo was a tablespoon so more beans than anything my over easy eggs sliced avocados potatoes were probably the only thing fresh oh and the pico de gallo was pretty good so overall it was alright for the amount of serving you get if youre starving itll fill you up most likely wont visit again husband said it was bland but did the job after adding salt pepper hot sauce since he was starving apart from the food the service surpassed the food there may be other breakfast places that are more unique have better individual menu items or are more compelling for one reason or another but over the years this place has consistently provided great healthy meals and excellent fast friendly service i have never had a bad experience here and have always left wondering why i dont come back here more often then i go and try some new trendy breakfast joint only to realize i would have been better off coming back to first watch instead my personal favorite dish is the chickichanga but ive eaten half the stuff on the menu and its all been really good and i particularly enjoy the fact that no matter what i eat there i never feel like i just ingested lbs of cheese and grease when im done its all light and healthy and fantastic great service the staff all have great smiles oatmeal and turkey sausage links with black coffee the pecans and cranberries make the oatmeal tasty amazing and cheap breakfast everything was fresh and delicious you get your own personal coffee pot for your table the service was outstanding our waitress was so sweet and even offered a to go cup for my coffee we ate here because it was across the street from st josephs hospital where our baby was in intensive care had the parma hash it was amazing i love the server tomara she has an awesome personality she noticed my hospital bracelet and we told her about our baby and she was sweet enough to say a prayer for him i would definitely recommend this restaurant it has a friendly happy environment the service is amazing as well as the food everything i have tried so far has been perfected in taste and presentation i love breakfast and first watch does it right i had a hard time deciding because there were so many healthy options along side heartier food service was good ill be back really good with good healthy options i had the chikichimi which was wonderful came with fruit to finish tha job whaaaaaaaaaattttt a special place for breakfast when we lean away from bacon and ham good food not located on and thomas the address is rd and thomas key west crepegg is really good the food is always been amazing there and they have great deal when my wife wants to go out to breakfast that is where we go the omelettes are the best great service food and reasonably priced the belgian waffle was one of the best i have ever had we had a great waiter very attentive n quick with all request will b back again a lot of food from breakfast places tend to taste of fatigue and depressed cooks but not here food tastes fresh nice portions and great variety on omelettes and sandwiches waffles and pancakes taste fresh and fluffy and helps with the depression of being in downtown phoenix the staff is always great feels like a folksy s movie because theyre mostly moms who ply on the coffee and food and tell you to eat your veggies had the parm hash with a pecan pancake hash was amazing and was a large plate pancake was decent but overall great breakfast spot great service for this area and especially for those in walking distance working at the hospital this place is a must visit i am consistently surprised at the intriguing new dishes that arrive for specials they got my order wrong but the dish they brought was delicious all the same quinoa pasta dish with a lemon sauce and fresh white meat chicken grilled on top also had the squash soup that tickled the tastebuds pink ignore the lackluster exterior and give this place a try been here for breakfast many times lunch only a few great american food with speedy service and fair prices only four stars because of the wait on the weekends which actually shows how good this place really is never been during the week but it would be a regular lunch destination if i worked downtown as mentioned in previous reviews i love breakfast for lunch the other day i had only minutes for lunch between meetings i was going to test my luck to see if i can order and consume an omelet within minutes i usually go to the good egg for breakfast for lunch but decided i would give first watch a try the experience was satisfactory but not great server was polite enough but no personality he did constantly fill my water which was a plus and he got my order in and food brought out quickly and efficiently i ordered a veggie omelet with a side of potatoes omelet was okay but a bit bland thank god for hot sauce the broccoli inside the omelet was raw which i found unappealing a nice saute steam or roast to them would have made this omelet x better the potatoes it came with were obviously previously frozen lacked seasoning and unevenly cooked the good news is that i was in and out of there in under minutes i dont think i will return on my own to first watch i find the food to be tastier and the service friendlier at the good egg our first visit loved it and well be back the food was prepared exactly as ordered we love having a coffee pot on the table overall a great breakfast experience im going to make this one short and sweet this restaurant has good food its not what i would call fancy or gourmet but its that kind of place that you know you and your group is not going to be disappointed we have been there a couple of times and there is always a wait but never too long and it is always worth it the hash breakfasts are my personal favorite and everything about them tastes homemade if you are one of those who really likes hash but asks if its canned because you dont like the kinda salty mushed stuff with little tiny chopped potatoes well you are going to love this place because it is truly homemade and well portioned and full bodied with great flavor there is always more than enough food to go around we are big boys and like to eat and start our vacation days with good food for breakfast and have never been disappointed here when ever in phoenix i think we eat here at least once we always try new places because we are adventurous but first watch is the place that comes to mind if there is any question or if youve had a bad meal you always think i should have just eaten there i would also say they are the masters of comfort food good food time and again that you can count on thank you wow really great hash i appreciate that this brunch place gives you a seasonal menu outside of their regular fare the benches in the place are a little shallow and im a big guy so there was slight discomfort however the quality of service and food quickly made me forget any tweaks i would make to the seating situation the portions are great and even an arugula salad was elevated and tasty well definitely be coming back best breakfast brunch lunch service in town affordable and great for kids the staff is super professional and kind any plate you order will be delicious never disappoints my favorite place for brunch for sure my favorite breakfast stop in central phoenix the pancakes are huge the coffee is smooth and flavorful service is friendly and your food is out super quick my breakfast faves are the various omelette sand scrambles but my sinful guilty pleasure there is the monte christo ask for extra preservesjelly as it gives a great contrast in flavor its probably the best monte christo ive ever had we hit up first watch this morning and my first thought was boy what a popular joint the wait was quoted at minutes but we were seated in else than ten service was excellent jenny enjoyed the waffle breakfast and i had an acapulco express omelette both were good and we cleared out plates sipping on the coffee caution its a strong brew to wrap up our casual saturday breakfast not a lot of bells and whistles but first watch seems to know what theyre doing definitely a safe bet if youre looking for a dependable weekend breakfast stop i love first watch we would go every saturday when i lived in st louis and when i moved to los angeles i looked to see where the nearest one was and well i made the drive just to get a little bit of home i never need a menu i always order the trifecta with a side of potatoes and a coffee its always on point and sometimes i add a little fruit first watch is is always grade a stopped in for a late breakfast because i saw a review for this place i must say the highlight was the multigrain carrot cake pancake wow server was on the border of unfriendly but the rest of the staff were great will try it again first watch is really the best spot in the area for breakfast ive never had a wait on a weekday the service is quick actually its instantaneous theres never a wait for more coffee as they give you your own thermos of quality coffee ive not been adventuresome with the menu sticking always to their reliable traditional breakfast going with the sausage links if you too rebel against the all too commonplace and tasteless sysco sausage patties youll love these delicious sausages they cook them perfectly at first watch youll have plenty of room in their booths whether youre dining alone with your work papers all spread out or sitting with others noise level is perfect for having a meeting over a meal first watch servers are first rate pros a perfect balance of down to business attention accompanied by a friendly smile but without the overlay of fake and distracting cutesy chitchat everything in the place is clean the whole operation is well organized and everything ive ordered has been delicious you cant go wrong ive just realized ive never yelped fw what a tragedy fw is my absolute favorite breakfast place in the world really the food is seriously fresh and top of the line the service is unbeatable the atmosphere is friendly comfy and nice you can tell that all around from frontline to kitchen staff the place is run well my husband and i go to fw at least two weekends a month and bring out of town family and friends here at every chance everyone is always so pleased and impressed and jealous that they dont have their own first watch locally ahem fws are needed in oregon im having a hard time identifying single things to write about since i literally like every single aspect of the place one big positive tamara shes usually our server and i feel like she goes out of her way to have us as patrons she is so sweet friendly and warm we love getting her the house coffee fantastic the waffle stellar do what i do and have the fruit from the floridian french toast added to the waffle the house potatoes wayyyy better than regular hashbrowns the omelets incredible tip sign up for their online club fw sends me coupons on the regular and also sends me a free entree certificate on my birthday d go to first watch you wont regret it frankly when i yelped first watch and saw all the star reviews i was very confused it has a very average updated diner vibe think dennys with a bit of class i went this morning around and i have to say i wont be back any time soon pros very good service the waitress was very attentive and happy to bring us whatever we needed easy to find right off of thomas a crossed from the hospital plenty of parking good prices about per entree nice sized portions as well cons let me first say that the coffee was not good i am an avid coffee drinking but by no means am i a coffee snob im not sure what was up with this coffee but it was so bitter it felt like it was coating my teeth and mouth to the point that i could no longer drink it however for the record i did not ask for a new cup and im quite sure that with stars not all their coffee could taste this way the food was as my grandmother would say nothing to write home about i got the biscuits and turkey sausage gravy came with a side of potatoes and eggs of your choice i got poached the eggs were sitting in a little bowl with a small collection of water at the bottom they were cooked perfectly though the gravy and potatoes were good however the advertised the biscuits as being homemade and they were rather dry while id give the service a id have to give the food a with all the great breakfast and brunch spots around the valley i wouldnt bother wasting your time or money at first watch quick friendly service and a delicious pancake is there any better way to start a morning breakfast yesterday before spring training baseball treated my wifes cousins who loved the quinoa salad and biscuits and turkey sausage gravy came here after seeing how busy matts big breakfast was virtually no wait here got seated all the way in the back my only complaint about that was the back wall has a long bench that multiple tables share and there was a little girl next to us that kept getting up sitting down getting up sitting down so the slats on the bench kept moving pretty annoying but they left before long and a new group sat down that remained pretty still our waitress was very friendly and spoke in a calm and happy tone but she used some weird phrasing and kept making odd jokes so i guess she was almost too friendly and we thought it was strange but also entertaining i ordered the tri fecta with a waffle scrambled eggs well done and bacon the food came out quickly and everything tasted fresh eggs were cooked right the waffle even came with a side of mixed berry compote that was good i also tried some of the bacon cheddar pancake my friend ordered with his meal it was really good savory and delicious we ended up taking half of it home if we make it back here id like to try the floridian french toast it looked pretty good was impressed as soon as i walked in the lobby and restaurant are super clean and theres a warmth about the place think cracker barrel but fresher lighter and not cluttered menu is very impressive clean eating options and full allergen info on the website had the chicken salad spinach salad fresh and yummy and the kale tonic on the spring menu tastes awesome close your eyes if you need to service was super fast and prices extremely affordable im from out of town wish i had one in my backyard extensive menu for a breakfast lunch place so many healthy choices service was fast and friendly i ride my bike often and really appreciate that they have a bike rack in the shade there is also a patio that is on the east side of the building so its not so hot the food is great and the staff are always friendly be careful of the pancakes they are like a pound each and are addictive it was good but not particularly impressed got the breakfast scramble definitely something i could have made myself at home biggest complaint is their potatoes oh my goodness you might as well order a side of fried onions i was pulling out huge chunks of onion and the intense flavor of onion was impossible to make with ketchup or hot sauce and apparently they are completely unable to make a side of potatoes without onions because theyre pre mixed together they were atrocious my wife and i visit this first watch cafe regularly for breakfast while were out for our morning walk the food is great lots of healthy alternatives the coffee is outstanding and the staff is super friendly its always a great experience you are seated right away great service friendly staff love there breakfast oatmeal came here on a sunday morning seated quicklyfor being a bigger party food came out fast and delicious well be returning had to wait min after being seated to have anyone see us the restaurant staff were not even in a rush at this time we are very patient people but that long to even take a drink order is ridiculous i love this place great service every time and always excellent food i love eating breakfast here o o o when it comes to breakfast i feel like everyone has one go to place for breakfast and first watch claimed my title best breakfast place in phoenix i have had the pleasure of being served in first thing which everyone must try the hot chocolate the best way to start your in my case late morning so good and they give you a decent size mug to enjoy this drink now the amount of food you get is enough to cover a few meals in your day which is a big bonus but the winning prize goes to the flexibility of the menu and the staff i do not eat pork and if you are the type to want some meat in your omelette its hard to choose something off the menu without pork in it first watch has plenty of substitute options and they do not count pennies on the ingredients they stack it up i believe i purchased the avocado omelette and a two pancake side the omelette i asked if i could sub in some turkey sausage and they delivered the plate was packed with potato omelette and english muffin now the pancakes o my was the cherry on top best pancakes out there fluffy filling and man it actually warms my heart knowing there is someone out there who took the time to deliver those stacks overall great restaurant friendly staff whoever the owners are bravo open up a first watch next door to me cause i will be there everyday also my bill was about dollars for myself and my girlfriend to order breakfast with coffee and hot chocolates so its not over priced and i would of paid more for that meal i love this place my husband and i order here more than any other restaurant i also love that they allow us to order previous specials that are no longer on the daily menu the quinoa bowl with sausage kale and roasted tomatoes is delish this little gem is a great find the food is fresh no microwaves and super delicious it was around lunch when i visited and the parking lot was full inside the place was busy but not overly busy we were seated right away decor inside was nothing to really speak of but the food is the main attraction here i had the not guilty your honor a fabulous choice it came with a bowl of soup todays soup was italian wedding ball the soup was so close to my grandmothers it was scary yes its degrees outside but it was so good i had to eat every drop the wrap was moist fresh and super tasty it was enough to fill me but not leaving you with that over stuffed feeling from other dishes that were walking by and pics ive seen here i most definitely will be back and i will tell others this is the spot for lunch sadly its too far from me to experience breakfast wow so good the place was packed and we still were seated immediately our waitress was so sweet and very quick with everything the food was also delicious many options on the menu and so much flavor in each dish that we ordered i had the floridian french toast amazing my daughter had a chocolate chip pancake which was also amazing very fluffy and it came with bacon i ordered sausage links as extra and i liked them but my brother and father didnt my father liked the sausage patties better the like was much softer bacon was perfect brother had biscuits and gravy and usually i dont care for that dish but his were yummy overall excellent its fall days shorter cooler and the lizard brain threw the winter switch like wandering bears preparing for the snows of winter never falling in phoenix sweet d and me are back to oatmeal the blueberries of fall surrounded by heat transformed batter called from first watch we stopped in had eggs blueberry pancake and the banana and pecan studded first watch oatmeal we enjoyed every aspect of our meal except the chris does yelp part sweet d expects focused attention as we discuss dealing with cubic feet of boxes and packing paper as we return another cubic feet of furniture and stuff home plus pressing non public personal events first watch earned star from me the food was filling and delicious the morning light on our table energizing the service very good with coffee and water carafes avaialable for self serving liquids the prices are a bit high the crowd a bit noisy for us but not enough to knock a star from the first watch skies my grandsons and i visited this spot in the neighborhood for breakfast jacqueline h food was good out of service was reasonably attentive and friendly out of atmosphere was pretty normal for a breakfast place nothing earth shattering but decent out of bathrooms were really dirtyold out of manager was very friendly and seemed to care about the business id give him a out of food was a bit pricey for the portion size out of although i didnt leave hungry overall id give first watch a out of would i go back yes if there were nothing else to pique my interest to try and to review that was close by id go again to see if its different from this experience not that it was a bad experience would i run back if there were other places close by that i had not been not right away but if i wanted a good standby restaurant with decent food a decent atmosphere good service where i wasnt expecting to be blown away ya id stop in again quick friendly service and we had awesome food i tried the cherry chicken quinoa bowl and green tea yum love this place everyone always has a smile and willing to stop at your table to make sure everything is ok even if they are not assigned to your table they make fresh made muffins daily the food is healthy and delicious i love their house made granola every time i go i want to buy a bag of it to take home maybe one day first watch is different than any other breakfast place in that it not only serves fabulous egg dishes but the salads are unique and absolutely delicious quinoa and kale salad is to die for as well as the chicken salad i just wish this place served dessert but i am so thankful that i live so close to this restaurant both my husband and i plan on returning again and again to sample everything on the menu the staff is so friendly and helpful and the restaurant is remarkably clean it is a comforting place to dine the food is great the servers are great especially tamara the service is very fast our favorite breakfast place in phoenix perfect place for breakfastbrunch waffles are delicious and the service is outstanding my husband and i went here twice for breakfast and it was excellent both times i would recommend trying one of their drinks like the cucumber mint or kale tonic they are very refreshing the waitresses are super nice the portions are pretty large too so its a good value for your money good food expedient service good surroundings all the stuff you look for in a breakfast place even with a good pile of people waiting outside our wait was only quoted as minutes and i am sure we waited less than that order taking and food came in fairly quick succession and the presentation was very good plenty of classics on the menu but made up a little bit differently for example i had the sockeye salmon eggs benedict which were served on ciabatta rather than english muffin very good my man had the oatmeal and i would bet the fruit on top had been just cut and just for that order check arrived before we even started looking for it and we paid without delay these mornings are rare when traveling thanks love this location for first watch for starters it has been here as long as i can remember secondly i love the food it is always fresh and hot the service is wonderful as well of us came for lunch recently about pm close to closing as they only serve breakfast and lunch here even though they seated us in a section they had already closed because my friend wanted to seat there i thought that was very nice of them our service was great and so was our food remember if you sign up on line at their website they will give you coupons via email even a free meal for your birthday parking can at times be a little tricky but you should always be able to find something restrooms are always clean stars for the service the waitress wasnt that friendly stars for good price and healthy delicious food had the tri athlete egg white omelette it comes with yummy toast and fresh fruit food was nice and healthy not oily like most omelette are well i was so disappointed i would come here for i found to be the best oatmeal and seriously this all i would eat well my last picture shows his it has changed from one of my pics from last year it was blah no taste the texture of this new oatmeal was very bland they instead if a english muffin you have a choice of a muffin i choose the blueberry and it tasted like a generic from a single package from a box yuck so sad and i wont be going back anymore unless they go back to the original oatmeal best chocolate chip pancakes ever they also have a delicious iced coffee their staff is always friendly went in this morning and requested to sit in the back to get some last minute studying as i ate and they were so accommodating the food wait is reasonable i eat here at least once a week highly recommend this place looks incredible they completely remodeled i thought i walked into the wrong place this morning service was very friendly as always food looks and tastes amazing definitely recommend this place yummy local food with great service and nice atmosphere we got the salmon omelet and you pick two salad and half sandwich quick also great service from friendly attentive staff mediocre at best steel cut oatmeal saved by good strawberries and pecans the lemon poppyseed muffin i had was pretty good too but i wish the coffee we were served had been given as much attention as the staff gave us it needed cream and even then wasnt very good kianna is the best server had the sausage and mushroom hash with kale tonic very good first watch has been a frequent breakfast spot for my husband and i we recently dined here for the first time ordering off the lunch menu and found out they serve breakfast and lunch all the time awesome all of our visits here have resulted in great service and a satisfying meal something as simple as a great tasting carafe of water and delicious coffee with flavored creamers available at the table the food has always been great as well i usually order lighter options such as avocado toast highly recommend or the blte a ton of bacon on multigrain bread with spring mix tomatoes and an over hard egg yummy recently they remodeled and the place now has a fun farmhouse feel to it its a great spot to catch up over coffee i love this place the food is healthy fresh reasonably priced and delicious this place gets busy but they have a large community table for those dinning solo or with a friend i went on a busy sunday morning and was in and out in minutes because of the community table waitress was friendly and helpful too also the fresh juices are so refreshing and hydrating my favorite item is the avocado toast i could eat it everyday}
{64373, AJ's Pizzeria and Diner, 300 S Main St Verona WI 53593, stopped by late one night and picked up a pizza for takeout although it seemed to be a little pricey it was an excellent pizza tasty thin crust delicious pizza sauce and was very generously topped with mushroom big fresh slices and pepperoni so good this place is the same as falbos which i also give and i really love the pizza here it is topped with many mushrooms if you order them i really recommend this place wow i didnt know this place existed until today but my officemate and i had a hankering for pizza so we did a search for places that deliver and found ajs it wasnt the fastest ive ever had we called when they opened at am so it could be that they have high volume at the start of their day because it took about minutes to deliver at epic but it was delicious and totally worth the wait we got a deep dish special with one side the deluxe and the other half the spicy chicken both excellent i liked that their italian sausage is good quality with a lot of flavor and they dont scrimp on the toppings also the crust was chewy on the inside and crisp on the outside just right definitely would recommend to anyone in the verona area wanting some real pizza for delivery not dominos or papa johns formerly falbos until the owner branched out on his own hes kept up the good work not your choice for a fast cheap pie for that dominos and pizza hut deliver but how does the saying go good food is not fast fast food is not good having said that the two slices and a drink deal at lunch is a steal especially if food coma tops your afternoon to do list for the price the pizza goes a long way because its dense the crust is substantial and the toppings plentiful and the large is truly large if youre hankering for pizza in vtown ajs should be your go to choice my shout out for best pizza gos to ajs of verona it is a delicious foldable crunchy crusted pie with the perfect amount of toppings i order at least pizzas a week from these guys great staff and are always willing to help out our community with sales for hockey baseball and football i eat their pizza at baseball games all summer and will continue to be a faithful patron as long as you continue to be in business great job fellas great pizza spoiled by a poor conditions in the restaurant i will say that my family and i enjoyed our pizza a delicious hot thin crust pizza with fresh toppings and good sauce what concerns me however is the condition of the restaurant and the kitchen we decided to dine in initial impression was good a fun little pizzeria with a pinball machine and a coin op video game in the corner another family was seated and appeared to be enjoying their pizza things went south soon after we sat down cleanliness is a problem for the restaurant there were flies buzzing all over and i was repeatedly brushing them off of our table my kids and myself when the server brought a stack of plates two of them were dirty and i had to exchange them for clean er ish ones the kitchen visible from the counter by the entrance didnt look super clean either i was also a little offended that the flat screen in the corner was tuned to one of those pawn shop reality shows i had to explain to my kids why there was swearing and threats of violence things i would never let my kids see or hear normally on the tv if the owner expects families to dine there it shouldnt be the responsibility of the patron to ask the owner to switch to something more family friendly its sad we really enjoyed our pizza but that i wont be returning because i wont be able to eat it without questioning the sanitary conditions it was made in whatever you do do not overlook this little pizza joint in verona i can understand the urge to play it safe and order from a chain but if you go to ajs you wont regret it we have called ajs for delivery two times since we moved to verona and both times we had our pizza within minutes the thin crust is so good and their pizza reminds me of the pies you can only find in new york or new jersey tonight my husband and i went out on a limb and ordered the mac and cheese pizza and it was amazing we ate the entire thing rather quickly my only negative is that the crust was a little overdone on the bottom but just a couple spots were burned and it didnt matter the pizza was still delicious we will be back i love their blt wrap as a joke for my son who doesnt like tomato i got him a bacon lettuce turkey wrap both were perfection i love their pizza too what a treasure for verona good pizza prompt delivery felt like the pizza was perfect doneness and i like it thin crust cheese curds were not my favorite but okay wow all i can say is why didnt i know about this place sooner ajs offered a nice menu prompt and courteous delivery with a steamy hot pie and as a thin crust loving family i will tell you the crust was a huge hit why you ask was the crust amazing well first it was a delicious flavor it was a bit thicker at the edges pieces almost like a focacia and thin and crispy yet filling in the middle nom nom nom i ate all of the crusts so good ajs has the best pizza ever we just moved here from seattle and we are thrilled to have found this place the arizona ranch pizza is incredible as is the bacon cheeseburger pizza i highly recommend ajs its way better than anything from one of the pizza chains and the customer service is excellent ajs is awesome the owner is extremely friendly and welcoming and the food is always hot and delicious i highly recommend the gyros and the spicy chicken pizza their hot subs are also bomb insanely delicious i ordered the mac n cheese pizza and it was out of this world good so much flavor and fantastic crust great pizza love their breadsticks and their pizza is amazing their chicago style pizza is only okay sadly but their traditional pizza is my favorite in the area why does this place claim to be open days a week and then you call at on a sunday night and you cant even get somebody to answer the phone thats ridiculous either you are open or you arent pathetic i would probably if able give them stars we have tried both thin and stuffed our experiences had both good and bad first the good i like the crust it had good flavor and a nice crispness the sauce is quite tasty and the fresh veggies are delicious the bad let me start by saying that im originally from chicago so i hold all pizza establishments to a high standard one of the most important things for me on a pizza is the sausage both of the pizzas weve had included sausage the stuffed was just sausage and the thin had green pepper mushroom red onion and supposedly sausage and pepperoni i say supposedly because both were finely ground and were practically nonexistent i almost had to use a magnifying glass to find any visible proof that they werent forgotten and there was no evidence in the taste if im going to shell out i expect to taste the ingredients for which ive paid i also think they were a bit skimpy on the cheese pizza is all about the cheese this simply didnt have enough cheese i used to be in management at a pizza place so i know how much it actually costs to make a decent pie ajs definitely did not give anything close to my moneys worth for either pizza that being said i cannot recommend this establishment too bad i had high hopes}
{24963, Brannon Reed DDS, 8591 E Bell Rd Ste 101 Scottsdale AZ 85260, ill start by saying im not a big fan of the dentist chair in fact i tend to get queasy days before my scheduled appointment one bad experience under the bright lights and pointy utensils and it seems you are scarred literally for life enter dr brannon reeds office first of all the office ladies are too cute for words you feel like family or better enjoying a relaxing respite at the golf course i felt appreciated for being a client and baring my teeth for all to see thats kind of a big deal these days when all anyone seems to want is your moola and a revolving door i got the awkward drooly x rays and what was cool was before the cleaning dr reed spent some time going over things with me hes down to earth matter of fact and kind of funny i felt comfortable enough to ask the embarassing questions such as do i still have to wear my retainers at age answer yes sigh and felt excited to have a plan for the future of my teeth rather than the see you in six months conversation the cleaning was thorough well orchestrated with all those gadgets and over in a jiffy i had clean orange infused teeth and i kind of loved it overall it was an extremely pleasant experience something i havent been able to say about my semi annual exam in a long time they have a client for life in me i may even choose the dentist over other glorious tasks such as oil changes and annual exams i just recently visited dr reeds office for my six month cleaning appointment not only is dr reeds office comfortable and calming but his staff is by far the most professional and courteous group around i wouldnt trust just anyone with my teeth even though the office location is quite convenient for me i would follow him anywhere i highly recommend dr reed and his staff for all of your dentistry needs i have been a patient of dr reed since i retired to az from illinois in i have never been a fan of going to the dentist but i really hit the jackpot with dr reed and his staff from the moment you walk in you are grreted by name there is a refridgerator with water and juice if you are thirsty while waiting to be called and then you are greeted again by the dental assistants before actual dealing with dr reed what really impresses me is that dr reed will go out of his way to be sure you are comfortable and if there is any nervousness or fear it will be diminished as soon as your conversation begins dr reed makes it known he is there for you he gets to know you not only as a patient but as an individual when all is done you receive a personalized thank you card in the mail before the appt you will receive an e mail reminder as well as a postcard reminder of your appointment i could not rate dr reed and his entire staff any higher than what is possible the best in the country after years of my own neglect and mediocre florida dentists i was lucky enough to find dr reed and his all star staff have been there times this year and always prompt wonderful accurate service and results as well as a truly enjoyable time at a dentist office unheard of but true thanks again you all rock went to dr reed office today for a simple cleaning i tried the office out because of a groupon i bought it was the nicest office i ever been to the front desk people are very nice and the doctor was very gentle and talkative also you get a private tv while you wait for your x rays and a view of tpc scottsdale golf course they took pictures of my teeth and show them to me on the tv i never saw my teeth like that before i was amazed they also let you bring home the pictures i would recommend this place to everyone nice office people and dentist i ever met bleh i went to this doc from a groupon in retrospect any medical professional who needs to use a groupon is clearly not doing a brisk business i expected him to be and fresh out of medical school just being judged by the groupon thing not the case anyhow i went for my intro cleaning xrays etc from the groupon that was fine his staff was very pleasant and friendly i left with him telling me that i had a filling that has come loose so i can come back and he can fill it easily for me and at a discount never forget dentistry is a big marketing business so i went back for my fill turns out that also meant i needed to get a drill and fill well i didnt have the time for this so i told this to the receptionist who said she would mention it to the doc perhaps when i made the appointment and told the gal what i was coming in for she could have explained the procedure minutes later he comes in tells me it does need to be drilled and then refilled i said i was not aware that drilling was required as he had said it was simple refill and unfortunately i didnt have the time to do the whole procedure he said no not at all we have to drill out the decay what decay i asked and smirked because there is none it was a part of a filling that had come loose not a cavity he said well let me look at the tooth again which he does then he backs off his decay comment as there was none hes clearly rattled and clueless at this point using his instruments and pointing and stabbing at teeth aimlessly like peas on a plate he tells me he can have the whole thing done within the next minutes really is this the mcdonalds of dentistry at this point the last thing i want is this guy touching my teeth if he plans on doing a drill and fill in minutes so i get up to leave and tell him i need to reschedule so sorry and he says to me no lie well you just wasted minutes of my time i was agog i think he realized how inappropriate his comment was kinda like something you think but dont say so he tried to back peddle and said well lets get you rescheduled and lets plan on an hour for the fill oh the minute job you were just about to do is now a full hour i was truly in shock at this point and couldnt even speak i told the receptionist i would not be back and said she might want to tell the doc to not tell patients they have wasted his time and turned on my heels and left consider yourself warned and lesson to the unwise which i was if a doctor thats been in practice for many years needs to use a groupon to get business think twice the old adage is true you get what you pay for i love dr reed and his staff so friendly and always know your name his office is great and his equipment is top notch i thought my family i would try dr reed because of all the good reviews i felt the cleaning of my teeth was very average i like to have that really clean feeling after a dentist trip before i could tell my husband he actually told me his teeth dont feel clean the receptionist was lovely acted as though i had found a new best friend we decided to find another dentst i called to see if we could pick up our xrays and was told there would be a p p tranfer fee for my family i probably wouldnt have been so angry if i was made aware of this fee or if the girl at the front desk didnt lie to me she said i signed a form when i asked her to send me the form which i signed was told i didnt actually sign a form but the dental board etc etc i ended up getting the xrays emailed to me because i didnt trust this dentist anymore i purchased the groupon and went to use it and of course he said i needed a deeper cleaning and would not honor my groupon for a general cleaning and i had to purchase the deep cleaning after he showed me the xrays the only teeth that needed a deeper cleaning were my bottom which happens every time i get them cleaned which is once a year all the rest were fine but he would not honor the groupon hes such a rip off and trying to pay for his overhead and fancy office by telling you that you need more than you actually do i requested that they send my xrays to my regular dentist which i hope they did my regular dentist told me i didnt need to have a deep cleaning donel so i dont recommend him unless you want to pay for unnecessary services my whole family has gone to dr reed for yearly cleanings and dental work and we wont be back we spent k out of our own pocket on one family members teeth this did not include what our insurance covered less then yrs and multiple teeth are cracked when it was brought to his attention on this visit he blamed it on teeth grinding and he did not want to do any work to them until they totally break so now we have to walk around smiling with cracked teeth the last crowns and bridges we had done lasted yrs not five like these this was a lot or money and he and his office manager tried to blame the cracks on teeth grinding and not taking care of them umm what more can u do other than yearly cleanings none of us grind our teeth nor have we ever and if we did wouldnt you have mentioned it five years ago and at each subsequent visit we were upset and disappointed with how this situation was handled with blame and defensive attitudes towards us when it was brought to dr reeds attention we made an office visit as soon as we noticed the problem he and his office manager were very defensive and that is only one of the reasons we will not be back the other is we feel that defective products are being used by him and the lab he uses because other family members had problems but they did not want to say anything obviously because the one and only time we did look at the response we got we read that he did a groupon and then failed to honor some of the services for various reasons as you can read in the reviews on here teeth cleaning are good here i just would not recommend any fillings crowns or bridge work being done here lol in my book dr reed is a devious uncaring son of satan pay no attention to the testimonials on his website because they are filtered by him or you would see mine i got a root canal post and crown done by reed in for the crown fell off but fortunately i still had it and he glued it back on this is my only root canal he said it may be a while before the sensitivity gos away in i went back because it was always aching he ground the tooth surface down and said try that i went back in with an abscess on the gum above the tooth he gave the root canal and crown while i was waiting to see him one of the assistants was prepping me and kept wiping her weeping eye i asked her whats wrong she said its just a stye and not contagious i said styes are very contagious she said really i didnt know that and kept working that kind of grossed me out then reed came in and lanced the abscess and said common back if you get anymore bumps like its no big deal i asked if he could or would re do the root canal he said no he did not give me any other options so i thought removal of the tooth was my only other option i continued getting abscesses more frequent and started popping them myself i must have popped dozens i was on antibiotics times for them finally in i had enough aches and abscesses and was willing to get the tooth removed i went back to reed with an abscess to let him pop it he popped it and said he could do nothing else for me and i should see a specialist first and only time he suggested it every time i went back with complications from the root canal reed would try to charge me a fee i did not have insurance and was too stubborn to pay someone else to fix his work in jan i gave in and saw ryan h engelberg he suggested i get an apicoectomy which reed never mentioned this way i could keep the tooth and only the tip of the root would be removed he wanted to do it and just for that visit i then went to algodonez mexico and had the apicoectomy done for by oral surgeon dr hector ivan gomez at the office of dr ivan gaspar he documented a mm file tip that had broken off in the mesial root and gave it to me to keep i made a complaint to the dental board for compensation the boards reason for turning me down was the surgeon was not a us citizen in i was reluctantly seen by reed i showed him the statements from all the visits the file tip and x rays he said he would give me nothing because i took him to the board and its been too long what was too long was the years of misery thanks to this man i said shouldnt you measure the file you use for a root canal before and after the procedure to see if your leaving any file tips behind he said he did i said then you knew you left a file tip in me and didnt say anything either reed didnt bother measuring the file or he did and knew the tip broke off in me either way or anything in between is negligence i measured the file tip and it is actually mm long that is significant enough not to miss any descent person would have mentioned out of all my years of visits that a file tip is or might be in me and that an apicoectomy could remove it every jaw that i have dropped believes i am entitled to some compensation from this man and i have gotten nothing i would have taken reed to small claims court but found out i only had years to do it my reply to reeds reply is you didnt suggest i see a specialist for years because you knew what he would find the dental board told me they do not recognize non us citizens documented findings as evidence that is the only reason they turned it down the complaint has more merit than reed does scruples or compassion how can you advise me not to go to mexico for treatment when i knew nothing about going until years after i saw you last sounds like your worried about losing patients an understanding can be reached just give me a much deserved refund it was years not over since i saw reed before now i have the office statement to prove it keep the inaccurate replys coming my family i have been going to dr reed for years he is a great dentist his staff is top notch i think people who use groupons for health care deals are reaching if they think they are getting something for free its more of a discount on the first encounter great marketing to get your name out they are good for cosmetic whitening most people who go every months regular cleanings is not going to use a groupon so its being purchased by people who have not been in years upkeep has been neglected a great dental office with a great staff dr reed is a true professional who is skillful and honest i always feel like i have great experiences here and they are always friendly and accommodating they treat me like a person always remember my name and i would recommend to anyone looking for outstanding dental care everyone is so helpful caring and nice amazing dentist and staff i see the doctor for my invisalign and teeth cleanings my teeth look great and i would recommend him to family and friends any day thanks guys for doing a great job consistently i have been coming to dr reeds office for about years now everyone on his staff is very friendly and caring i have routinely been coming every months for cleanings and have had a few fillings done with no complaints they also always get me in right at my appt time and i have never had to wait which is a big thing for me i highly recommend this office dr brannon reed dds and his staff are fantastic i originally found them a few years ago because of a groupon deal when i was in between dental plans i came in for a quick cleaning and was blown away by the level of service they provide i subsequently moved out of range of their practice and switched dentists but a new job put me very near their north scottsdale office years after i used the groupon i still remembered how great of job they did so i got back in touch i recently used them for a standard cleaning and checkup they did not disappoint from the second you walk in the door the staff is friendly and organized my hygienist courtney i believe was very thorough and easy on my teeth most importantly she put up with my constant questions about dentistry and my teeth technology wise they have all the new equipment and it provides an extremely pain free experience dr reed came in to check me out and even removed a permanent retainer i had been carrying around in my mouth since the mid s it felt great to get rid of that thing he then put together a treatment plan for me that will keep my teeth in good shape for the coming years if you are looking for a dentist in north scottsdale you cant go wrong with dr reeds office pro tip make your appointment early in the week as they give out the golf balls that were hit onto their property over the weekend from the tpc scottsdale course i just started to enjoy a two week vacation here in scottsdale and my tooth started to hurt must be murphys law in action anyway i had never been to a dentist anywhere except back home so i looked up dentists on the internet and chose dr brannon reed with what i would call an emergency his office staff got me in for an evaluation of my troubled and now really hurting tooth after taking an x ray it was apparent that an old root canal was infected he was unable to do the work at that time so after several phone calls he referred me to dr thomas v mcclammy located just a few buildings away in the same complex when the visit was completed i asked how much i owed for the time spent on the evaluation and the x ray and was told that because i was on vacation and was in pain they would wave the charge and sent me on my way i have no dental insurance i was still thanking them as i walked out the door what a great experience even with a very sore tooth thank you again dr reed i was recently in for a full exam and required a deep cleaning as its been a long time since ive been to a dentist i just have to say that everyone here is amazing the high level of care and service is remarkable the only dentist i dont dread coming to not many can say that the environment and people are really nice plus the nice location and office tops it all off without hesitation i will refer my family and friends here already brought my mom in and continue choose dr reeds office at my primary dental office i really cant understand some of the negative reviews i see here but im convinced that some people will just never be happy and they probably like it that way i ended up reading the negative reviews after my first few visits when i recommended my boyfriend and his family to dr reed i was actually appalled that anyone would think the office manager was not a nice woman because i think she is the sweetest thing all of the staff are truly enjoyable i also saw a review from a user who ended up being referred by another dentist to go to mexico for a surgery i just think no one in their right mind should go to mexico for medical procedures why couldnt your new dentist do it dr reed has done a wonderful job on my teeth i originally went to him because he will replace silver amalgam fillings i had all of mine replaced and if there is any question about teeth cleaning i must say i thought my boyfriends teeth were okay but after he had the deep cleaning i was taken aback by how clean they looked i had obviously never seen his real teeth he hadnt been to a dentist in years so plaque had built up he had gotten the groupon which does state its restrictions and doing the deep clean was his choice he will still be able to use the groupon later and personally when i had my teeth cleaned previously another dentist had told me what i thought was a cavity was actually a stain and that the hygienist would remove it but when i mentioned it she couldnt see it and assumed it was gone but it wasnt the hygienist at dr reeds office did remove it thank goodness my teeth felt very clean i just really believe that it is not fair to say that they dont know what they are doing or that the office staff is unpleasant because i think this place is wonderful this place has negative reviews for a reason because the great customer service only lasts for your first few visits i initially went here because they had a groupon and i did not feel like spending a ton on a cleaning they offered me a discount to have my cavities filled if i had it done in three months i thought sure thats a good offer everyone was really friendly and would confirm my appointments promptly etc i had my cavities filled and shortly after my right top one was still very sensitive and hurt any time i ate anything cold or sweet i let them know and they had me come in to fix the issue i went back times and its still the same i recently scheduled myself for a cleaning and they said they would contact me if someone canceled for a am appointment they emailed me to let me know they had a cancelation and that i could come in wednesday so on wednesday i drove out there i live in phoenix so its a minute drive for me when i arrive the doors are locked and theres another girl waiting outside i think to myself thats odd i am trying to kill time so i decide to go through my emails and of course they emailed me to cancel the appointment saying something came up etc never called the day before to confirm cancelation just an email i emailed them saying i never received notice of the cancelation and that i was upset about this i received a call that i chose not to answer since i was at work and the lady left a message saying they had called and left a vm too canceling the appointment i have my cell phone on at all times in my office and never received any of this i emailed her back letting her know and instead of caring enough about me as a patient and trying to fix the issue i didnt get a response back i work in a law firm so i understand how important it is to confirm cancelations because people dont always check their emails and you cant assume they do either i retired out here to scottsdale from chicago years ago i have never been a fan of going to the dentist relocating out here and not knowing anyone i took a chance and decided to select dr reed as my dentist the angels must have been looking out for me as this is the very best move i could have made from the moment you walk into the office you are always greeted with smiling and friendly faces there is a television in the waiting room along with a mini fridge if one would like bottled water once called back and you never wait too long dr reed and his staff treat you like family i have never had such great experiences at a dental facility and if i could i would give this place and dr reed ten stars gary wojton scottsdale dr reed has been the dentist for myself my dad and multiple people in my office for years and theres a reason we keep referring his practice to our friends and family i had a lot of dental work as a teenager and have seen a lot of dentists and i am very impressed by dr reed his staff his staff is organized and they are on time for my appointments they even allowed my newborn in her carrier to stay up at the front desk with them while i got my cleaning ive always been met with kindness and professionalism on top of excellent dental care i highly recommend dr reed and his staff really made me feel welcome i received some fillings and a crown recently and the experience was quite pleasant they are helpful with answering questions and making sure that i was always comfortable from the actual procedure itself to dealing with insurance and payment options at the front desk it was also nice to be able to look through the window on to the golf course view from the dental chair they really made me feel like family although i live in the west valley i dont mind at all driving as far as north scottsdale to get such great service ill be going back anytime i need dental services i moved to the area in december so i needed to find a new dentist as many people do i searched on groupon so that is what initially took me to dr reeds office for an annual checkup and cleaning i found his staff to be extremely friendly and professional in addition dr reed is a nice and gentle man this is important because someone without these qualities who is drilling in your mouth might cause some real problems recently i had a filling and it took about minutes the shot didnt even hurt i wanted to hug him the location is great too but when you find the building make sure you head to the right side as there is another dentists office in the front of the building that might confuse you i would recommend this dentist i have no dental insurance and their prices are fair i really enjoy everyone in dr reeds office iesha is especially helpful courtney did a very thorough cleaning and exam thanks to all my wife has been going to dr reed for a decade and got me going to them years ago kourtney is an awesome hygenist pretty much pain free had crowns done a couple years ago and did it over several visits excellent work no issues and prices were fantastic with our insurance highly recommend them i too had a groupon allowing me to find a new and local dentist it was nothing but what i had hoped for staff was friendly and courteous dr reed was honest and friendly i am pleased with my experience and have found my permanent dentist thank you again nathan i wanted to take the time to add to my previous review i have spent days over the last weeks getting some work done and like i said previous dr reed and his staff are by far the best team i ever been a patient for i was in within minutes of my check in time and been out within an hour the friendliness honesty and ensuring that i was comfortable is what i truly have appreciated i still have a few minor this to do and i would not considering getting it completed by any other team it started with a groupon and ended with a permanent client thank you again nathan i really enjoyed this office visit i went for a general cleaningx ray visit the staff took the time to sit me down and go over everything with me in detail they are so considerate and caring dr reed is an incredibly warm and friendly gentleman i instantly knew i was in great hands when the doctor met with me he is very knowledgable in his work and takes the time to throughly explain his findings with you theres no doubt in my mind that i will definitely be paying them a visit for all my future dental needs i truly think that if you visit this clinic you wont find yourself being disappointed i have been seeing dr reed for over years he is wonderful and his staff is amazing i just went for a cleaning a couple of weeks ago and received a letter in the mail to find out that he is passing his practice over to a new doctor dr sluyk i am sad to see him go but i will say that dr slyuk was very nice and i will definitely be staying with the practice the office staff and hygienists are just wonderful very kind caring and they always go above and beyond to make sure you are taken care of highly recommend this practice trying to delete my review but for some reason there is no delete option on my account}
{69917, Toros Cantina & Gaming, 11760 W Charleston Blvd Summerlin Las Vegas NV 89138, new restaurant in summerlin food was good nice assortment of tapas and spanish wine servers were attentive and friendly give it a shot i created a yelp account specifically to warn people of this place thats how bad it was of the thousands of restaurants ive been to i have never felt the need to write a review so this is a first first of all the food was terrible just on that fact alone i would never go back in my entire life i have never sent my food back but after my first bite of the chicken and chorizo paella i looked down at this huge plate of food and had to send it back it had a really strange after taste that i cant accurately describe but i knew i didnt want another bite at least they did take it off our bill but a manager never came over on our way out i think the guy holding the door was the manager he asked how it was and i was honest he just mentioned that he would speak to the chef didnt offer a gift card or anything at all the service was pretty bad also one guest didnt like their drink after the first sip and nothing was offered other than to curb it by adding sprite bottled beer is drinks are about tapas are roughly and the paella is about they only have draft beer one positive is that they have a few large tvs that were easy to see but instead of playing sound from the football game they had slow depressing music the restaurant isnt very big either if you were to compare this place to firefly its no contest firefly is considerably better ill gladly take my chances with salmonella thank god i had left over pizza to come home to from earlier in the day even though i live right next to it this will definitely be my one and only experience with toros spanish kitchen and tapas i was hoping this place would be great ordered the bacon wrapped dates which i probably wouldnt order again the chicken chorizo paella was terrible we took one bite sent it back probably the worst ive ever had sent it back never had a manager come to the table our server was nice it was obvious that she had just come back from a smoke break i dont have any intentions on going back im so excited about this place i live in henderson but it is worth the drive i love the environment kind of rustic meets spanish food is unique as it is from different regions of spain menu even shows origins i moved here from idaho where there is a huge basque population it is great to bring some of that culture to this city also staff was very friendly and welcoming i was very impressed that the owner even came to my table to check on our experience all in all i would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great place to have drinks andor eat great food nice staff owner came around to make sure everything was great dont listen to people who complain about the prices you get what you pay for first of all im a major yelp user and like most of you on here i look at yelp for food recommendations however i am a terrible yelper and never actually post anything on here this place was so bad that i actually had to find time to post something to inform the public on how terrible this place is coming home from red rock canyon we party of decided to give this place a try the hostesses seemed lost when i requested a table for four she just walked in a circle around the restaurant before going back to the front to ask another hostess for help on where to seat us we ordered the mussels which were super tiny and came with half of them still closed why would you serve totally closed mussels to your patrons the dates at a whopping for three dont even have a nut in the middle like firefly giving them no texture the sangria was good however it was overloaded with ice in an attempt to minimize alcohol content and maximize volume with ice the bruschetta with ham not prosciutto as it should be was good but for for two tiny pieces it was way overpriced we also ordered scallops sausage and another item which we cancelled because we just wanted to leave and find another place to eat basically everything is so overpriced that you will spend per person and leave totally hungry the quality of the shrimp mussels and other meats is so poor and tiny that it seems that the owners are simply taking advantage of the summerlin area by charging such high prices for such low quality finally this tapas restaurant actually has gaming machines and huge flat screen tvs all over it with football playing loudly on all screens making this a hyped up pts rather than a spanish feeling restaurant stick with barcelona firefly or another tapas restaurant if you want to leave full and satisfied not hungry and ripped off food is very tasty i loved the oxtail and the crabbed stuffed peppers i gave them five stars because the atmosphere service and food were all pretty good and they just opend so it should only get better it is a little spendy but thats always what i expect from the summerlin area the food is well worth it though and ill definitely be going back soon just returned from a trip to barcelona and marbella and my husband and i found the food to be very authentic we also live down on the strip and have been regulars over at julien serrano aria the food at toros rivals the taste and quality but is significantly cheaper the menu has a lot of variety but not too much where you get lost we liked that it was a very relaxed and casual atmosphere making it perfect to just stop by it was obvious from the service that the restaurant had just opened and waiterswaitresses were not fully familiar with the menu etc but they were very friendly and polite im sure these issues will be resolved very quickly as they are to be expected in a new restaurant we are very excited about this restaurant and looking forward to it being a regular spot for us so excited to learn it opened could not wait to try we live in the area and used to frequent j cutter until the service and food went way down a couple of years ago unfortunitly after only visits we will continue to drive by and go else where staff management have no idea what is going on apparently does not care to ask slow service unknowlegable untrained cold food maybe its only for video poker players the food is delicious the atmosphere is fun and the service is fantastic already been back a lot of restaurants send out appetizers on small plates and call them tapas but for a truly authentic menu of spanish classics there are only three choices that i know of in las vegas toros jaleo and julian serrano the only real difference between the food at the other two is that those places cost about two to three times more i have been to toros three times now and i have tried almost everything on the menu including four types of their pallea having authentic spanish food brings back great memories of the times i spent living in spain the amazing sights and the friendly people i have been to jaleo and julian serrano at least half a dozen times each and they like toros are spot on when it comes to authenticity brian b said that the pitchers of sangria seemed expensive but at four glasses per pitcher that works out to per glass it seems pretty reasonable for hand crafted and properly made sangria especially since its basically impossible to find even a cheap glass wine for a glass i also read another comment about only having one beer on tap but they didnt mention that it is estrella damm one of the most popular beers in spain having a real estrella with authentic tapas is actually a thoughtful authentic touch at toros while eating at toros i met several people that actually have experience with genuine spanish cuisine from having lived or traveled a lot in spain or having gone to very authentic spanish restaurants like the reviewer anarae a they all agreed that toros is amazingly authentic if there is something on the menu that you are not familiar with just open your mind to something different and enjoy the flavors and culinary style of old world espana at toros toros is excellent i cant believe i see negative reviews on this place for one food is amazing filled with a bunch of flavor went to dinner with my wife and our server a younger guy i believe his name was omar he was very attentive and a blast very easy going and very knowledgeable about the menu gave us some awesome food choices which we decided to order so glad we did we started off with bacon wrapped stuffed dates they were amazingly delicious ox tail was amazing and the croquets were very good as well we ordered half roasted chicken which is amazingly good and finished off with apple banana bread pudding which our server suggested to us and again best meal weve had ill be coming back more then twice a week thanks to the food atmosphere and the service first time here the owner adam greeted us when we got here the hospitality was great classic rock music was very enjoyable and we loved the atmosphere we will definitely be back we came for a late dinner tonight i wasnt expecting much service wise from prior reviews but we had a great waiter and our food came out lightening fast the roasted peppers were delicious as were the crab stuffed padron peppers my husband thought the authentic spanish sausage was unique i ended the meal with the rice pudding delicious overall we liked the food albeit slightly overpriced but not necessarily for the neighborhood and the service was fantastic even the manager owner came over to see how things went i also had the glass white sangria it was yummy and did not seem overpriced we will be back and are happy to welcome toros to the neighborhood good food standard pricing for tapas good selection great service server assumed we hadnt had tapas before and gave us some general ideas about ordering a selection of different items and sharing i think they brought us one item that we didnt order but it looked so good we ate it anyway really good sliders spanish coffee alcoholic we dined at toros spanish kitchen on a sunday afternoon the restaurant was not very crowded the dining room offers a choice of high top and regular height tables also several patio tables with umbrellas our server was friendly and helpful service began with a basket of bread orders are submitted to the kitchen electronically table side the orders were delivered fairly quickly the angus sliders to an order were tasty and have a smoke paprika flavor if you look at the inside of the burger it may seem to be under cooked but it is actually the paprika thats mixed with the meat the sizzling chili shrimp to an order are very good use the bread to soak up the sauce yum sweet piquillo peppers stuffed with crab meat are delicious they come to an order and are served in a tomato sauce this is another winner a pitcher of white sangria was reasonably priced and had a nice fruit flavor the menu has a good variety of items which calls for a few return trips toros spanish kitchen is a nice addition and adds variety to the dining choices in the summerlin community only tried dishes squid in ink and chicken with peppers squid was fine but its just squid grilled the sauce is ink sauce not much taste chicken was obviously heated sauce was hot but chicken was like warm it tasted like tomatoe sauce without much more than that overall it was ok nothing special nor terrible the bread was poor but the aioli sauce was tasty theyd do better by serving tortillas or pita my piece of bread was a bit stale this place is really close to where i live do was hoping it was great but its just ok last night was my first time at this restaurant as i live on the other side of town first i must say that last nights background music was fantastic a great mixture of s and s which was nice as i did not feel like i was dining in a club on the strip next service was friendly and for the most part attentive and the food well we ordered sliders good garlic shrimp good calamari good the dish i liked the least was the potatoes but i think thats just about preference i have read the other reviews about the bacon wrapped dates and i must say that although i understand they dont include a nut in theirs like those at firefly or jaleo i prefer it with the nut again just preference i thought the portions were adequate to good and i think their prices are not much higher andor comparable to other tapas places tapas places in general tend to be higher in price and the bill does add up as you order plates and drinks overall i thought the place was good a dinner for four people cost for a neighborhood spot we just couldnt imagine eating here regularly they did a great job with the interior and it seems like a fun spot for after work drinks plus the sliders and oxtail our server was personable he ended up in the weeds and we had to get his attention multiple times for dishes and the check cons the grilled shrimp and salmon had very little flavor it took minutes to get our first few tapas dishes leading us to think that they had been sitting under a heat lamp and minutes to get our last two tapas dishes ron totally took care of our needs at the bar steve the manger was totally accommodating to all our needs food and drink was totally great piquillo peppers were to die for we will be back this is a spanish tapas restaurant that we stopped at on a saturday for lunch before heading to red rock canyon the decor is quite pleasant and for a saturday lunch it was not crowded at all the majority of the menu is made of small tapa type dishes the food was amazing and wonderful we shared different dishes plus a dessert every dish we had was full of flavor and just so tasty with a rate of i would imagine most the dishes on the menu would be quite good the service was also attentive the only thing that holds me back from giving it a is that if i came here when i was super hungry the bill would be far too expensive it is perfect if you want a lighter lunch i would most definitely return for brunch or lunch walked in and sat down last night there were only other people in there no one even acknowledged us or offered to be right with us after min of sitting at the bar with not even a drink order taken we left and went to john cutters oxtail was good other than that the flavors of the food were really bland their flan had a really bitter sauce that was gross wont be back to dine here there are so many better options for tapas in town so we went in for dinner having been to numerous tapas restaurants before we knew what to expect basically small sharing portions first it was freezing in there half the patrons were still bundled wearing their coats i being one of them and we were seated no where close to the door second the music was so loud that our waiter missed some of the dishes that a guest at our table ordered the items that we ordered i felt like i was screaming i had to repeat a few times until they were clearly understood third our waiter was horrible and not because he couldnt hear orders over the music when we first entered it was fairly early dinner time there were other folks sitting and being waited on not us finally he arrived took our drink orders then he disappeared drinks dropped off again he disappeared time passed he ran by dropped off bread disappeared at the time we were is only table after about minutes he finally came by to get our food order disappeared he only reappeared to toss some food on the table finally able to flag him down and ask for more bread i wanted it to sop up some yummy morsels i left on my plate without asking he just grabbed my plate and told me i could get a clean one the whole point was i didnt want and clean one it is also a pet peeve of mine when a waiterwaitress touches my plate without asking it was at that point we informed him that some of our food was missing so after a longer wait at this point the place was filling up we finally completed our meal fourth pricing again we know tapas but somehow the prices did not match at all to what you were getting firstly its located in a very family style community there is another restaurant catty cornered to this one they understand this concept and although they are considered a tavern are constantly packed because of the family friendly prices and atmosphere secondly i personally dont think that paying for tempura artichoke hearts when pieces come on the plate they were barely a mouthful each and they obviously used canned artichoke is worth it overall despite the pricing most of the food was good the sliced trio of chorizo was extremely greasy and oily bacon wrapped dates ive had better bacon was nearly burnt they were served over shredded lettuce that made no sense and there was no sauce the gambas con arroz for the price was worth it my only issue with that was again canned mushrooms and canned peas at this point i think ill stick to my other tapas restaurants i feel they are a much better value for dessert because i couldnt take the waiter anymore i was uncomfortable frozen and the music being so loud we couldnt have a conversation we opted to go to the grocery store across the parking lot the hubs and i ate here for lunch on friday and was pleasantly surprised its a sister property to john cutter which we dont think of as impressive since the service always sucks thats another review though we started off with one of their signature cocktails i had the cranberry fizz and he had the bloody caesar although the drinks were pricey they werent watered down or tiny the first thing that came out was their bread and honestly it was the best bread i had at a restaurant in a long time super rustic and crusty served with some sort of aoili the manchego cheese plate was really good too stuffed piquillo peppers just ok garlic shrimp well cooked but i expected a little more flavor and punch meatballs succulent and flavorful i was slightly put off by the continuous use of red sauce though i love the decor of this place and it certainly helps that its a short walking distance to our house i really hope that it does well so the neighborhood has more options besides john cutter its tapas not topless this restaurant located at the corner of w charleston and desert foothills opened on november st brought to us by the same group who run john cutter right next door i enjoy tapas places because you get to sample lots of small plates ordering more of those you like its a mini buffet that comes to your table our group of four ordered bacon wrapped dates unlike another tapas place in town these are really dates wrapped in bacon the dates are not stuffed with anything except their own sweetness solid meatballs i needed a dish with more protein so i ordered these nothing spectacular bread and butter carbs oxtail my favorite dish of the night which i only had to share with one friend i could have had another order all to myself fall off the bone meat and a nice sauce to go with it ahi im allergic to fish so i only looked at this the friends liked it garlic shrimp i had one nothing special asparagus this was another winner for me the grilled spears tasted great croquetas deep fried cream cheese bechamel sauce and ham i think whats not to like i liked manchego cheese served in three chunks with some toasted bread on the side i like this cheese but wish it had been sliced for us or at least give us a cheese slicer so we can do it ourselves serrano ham too salty but thats just me flan yum the sauce has cinnamon in it my pal could have done without the cinnamon but i loved it i also had a glass of the red sangria which was not too strong just the way i like it our server omar was very attentive the whole night and the food came out very quickly the bar in the middle of the room has video poker machines and there are several flat screen tvs throughout the restaurant so this is a great place to come and watch sports in a non smoking environment and with good food that isnt your typical bar fare overall a great time was had by all its a welcome addition for the locals who live in the neighborhood and well definitely be back stars is not enough to describe this experience service provided by zack added to the amazing ambiance of toros it is a must do for all visiting vegas hands down the best meal we have had while here the escargot antipasto platter and padron peppers were delectable the bread pudding melts in your mouth and is a flavor explosion combined with the sauce and ice cream drive as quickly as allowed to toros it will be an experience you are sure to become addicted to very good food and even better service the only thing to criticize is that they always play classic rock i love classic rock just as much as the next guy but the music doesnt quite fit in with the place the music zaps the energy right out of a place that could have a really awesome atmosphere i really enjoyed the food and service excellent food but i do agree with other reviewer about the music music makes a huge difference while you are dining and in the case of this restaurant continuous classic rock does not match the food served literally i want to go in have excellent food and get out asap because the music is draining hope they change it or mix it at least reading over the reviews submitted so far for toros i am baffled most yelpers rave about the wonderful food the few exceptions thought the food was fine but too pricey i couldnt disagree more with either camp first the food i have a fairly strict standard for eating out trader joes frozen entrees huh wha lemme splain a while back i discovered that trader joes offers remarkably good frozen food no not as good as making everything from scratch with fresh ingredients but orders of magnitude better than any other frozen cuisine after sampling a few dishes i decided that if a restaurant wasnt noticeably better than tjs frozen its just not worth it thats when i decided to never again eat at the likes of fridays bennigans outback etc mind you the restaurant doesnt have to be fancy ill eat at a hot dog stand as long as it serves really good dogs although trader joes doesnt offer spanish tapas im pretty sure that if they did theyd be a helluva lot better than the menu at toros wow what a morass of mediocrity started with the chicken in saffron sauce and the braised oxtail the chicken had no flavor just bland white meat chicken and the saffron sauce just tasted like a generic cream sauce straight out of some bottle the braised oxtail meat was ok but the sauce it was drowning in was off if i kept the meat and vegetables out of the weird sauce it was ok then i ordered bacon wrapped dates grilled asparagus and seared salmon the bacon wrapped dates tasted awfully generic i dont know what the difference is but the b w dates at jaleo are a thousand times better the grilled asparagus with aioli was the best dish of the night although thats damning with faint praise and the seared salmon with spinach and garlic sauce was nowhere nearly as good as whatever frozen salmon dish at trader joes i didnt realize it was a garlic sauce until i saw it on the menu just now because it tasted like flavorless white cream sauce tasted the same as the supposedly saffron cream sauce im guessing toross saffron is yellow dye something the salmon was overcooked therefore a bit dry and lacking flavor and the spinach was horribly salty finally on to dessert apparently the spanish version of rice pudding is rice pudding with cinnamon sprinkled on top if youre craving rice pudding buy it at costco costco rice pudding is worlds better than the stuff at toros the atmosphere left me somewhat annoyed the serverbartender i ate at the bar was very nice but got a bit annoying because instead of asking me how things were she kept asking isnt everything just amazing isnt the food fantastic dont you just love it no no and hell no i ordered a glass of sangria for cheap red wine mixed with up and a lot of ice toros is also a nevada style pub which means they have video poker at the bar for most of my meal there was a group playing the machines and they were quite raucous when celebrating every little win im not criticizing them but be prepared for that if you eat here the one thing im not criticizing at toros is the prices the menu prices are all very reasonable i had a off groupon but even at full price my bill for the large quantity of food i ordered wouldnt have come to much also they have happy hour forget the hours when a lot of the items are half price if youre idea of a great steakhouse is outback or great italian is olive garden then youll probably love toros me ill save my money for jaleo if i had the opportunity to eat meals at toros for the same price as meal at jaleo id savor the meal at jaleo and enjoy my heated up trader joes the rest of the year found this place by happenstance while trying to find albertsons we came in on a monday and discovered their half off tapas special we admittedly went a little crazy and boy were we glad we did the tapas was amazing we ordered the grilled asparagus tempura artichoke hearts sea scallops calimari ribs and ox tail all of these dishes were incredible unfortunately they were out of the escargot guess that leaves something for next time we finished dinner off the spanish coffee and the lava cake we will definitely be back and with friendsfamily too we are so excited that there is a neighborhood bar to go to besides john cutters i dont have a penis dont gamble nor do i play golf yet i get great service unlike the sister restaurant next door ronald and rheanna are such professional and friendly bartenders who are all we could ever hope for manager steve is great also people who complain about food have so many other places to go within a five mile radius happy trails to you all we are very content at toros the happy hour is great i hope they keep it got a groupon for here the food is pretty good and nothing on the menu has been bad after our second visit the only thing lacking are the drinks the bloody ceasar is pretty good most most of the menu drinks are just so so great food very good selection love the atmosphere will go back highly recommended i have been here two times and each time was scrumptious the decor is really cute and they have mason jars at the table holding silverware extra point bc i love mason jars now on to the meat of the matter literally the oxtail is amazing the meat is tender and the flavor burst into your mouth with every bite the dates are good and so is the calamari i am a girl that loves my sauces and the sauces that come with the calamari are really good the sangria is yummy as well look for groupon deals so you can get a bang for your buck overall toros spanish kitchen gaming will def be in my restaurant rotation the service is good very attentive employees the decor is pretty modern and pleasant however the food is not that good i tried the stuffed piquillo peppers which were pretty decent the croquetas were pretty soft and not very tasty the safron chicken was terrible and the bacon wrapped dates were just ok the best thing we tried was the gazpacho good portion good price and there was a lot of meat on it they also have a happy hour menu and am drinks and some tapas items have a good price but truly the food is not that tasty that is not even worth it my wife and i went for diner tonight for the second time the food was magnificent it reminds me of the mediterranean riviere when my wife and i were there on our honeymoon we are very happy that this great restaurant for spanish cuisine is finally near by on the west side it was a wonderful experience please do not change anything this was a wonderful experience i recommend it to anyone who likes spanish cuisine i have no idea how this place is ranked so high everything that we ordered before the main course was blandsalad saffron chicken bacon wrapped dates calamari all had no taste the chicken tasted like chicken soup base with boiled chicken the worst offender was our main course the seafood paella for a shared entree you would expect something tasty that you cant wait to go back again for but it was awful the paella was it honestly tasted like rancid vegetable oil with boiled vegetables and mushy rice i couldnt find any chorizo or chicken which would have added flavor the seafood was there but guess what totally lacking in any kind of seasoning the clams were also full of sand and it was very unpleasant having spit out grains of and with each bite i actually am getting pissed off thinking about this because our check was pretty damn high we actually left a little hungry because we didnt want to finish the main course we got there around pm and we decided to wait for the happy hour at pm we got estrella beer which is really giod seafood soup and meatball with fries fries for the kids all this before pm the soup was ok mussels clam shrimp and few pieces of some white fish that tasted really good after we got the chix wings pan boli saffron chicken and fried calamari the chix wings where really good the calamari was better the batter stayed crispy after mins which is weird to find a batter like that pan boli it was great for the soup pcs of baguette toasted with jamon serrano manchego and evoo the saffron chicken a disapointment no flavor no seasoning no saffron looked like a turmeric puree on top of chicken the service was ok but there was problems between customers and the bartender some people left so disapointed that even the manager couldnt fix whatever issue they where having maybe ill be back but this town is getting so full of tapas bars that is getting boring we came here last night for dinner we were greeted and sat immediately the hostess was very friendly and our waiter was very attentive they dont have a large portion to choose from on their menu for tapas but all of the tapas are half off on mondays which is super nice also the wine list isnt very large but they have a full bar for everything else we had a fairly decent number of dishes angus sliders stuffed peppers artichokes filet scallops asparagus lava cake everything was okay the garlic aioli if you dont want insanely strong garlic in your mouth for hours steer clear most of the dishes were fairly bland and there wasnt much to them everything came out very quickly the waiter said they dont let anything sit in the window and its all made fresh which was bizarre because a few of the dishes he brought out were barely luke warm so i dont believe that was the case it seemed in a way that he was doing his best to convince us that the food was good he was a great waiter but the food it was mediocre i cant see myself coming back again i like good food especially when im paying for it i really really wanted to love this place it looked great from the outside and walking in the decor was well done it is clean and inviting however although we were the only two customers in the entire store during lunch hour the service was still very slow the food was overpriced and not very good at the end of our lunch we waited quite a while and no one brought the check finally my friend just got up to find an employee i will say that i dont gamble or drink so i cant rate those items the atmosphere is very nice and quite comfortable thats the good part of our visit to toros i found the food lacking any seasoning or taste has the chief heard of salt or pepper portions are very small we ordered the braised rib we got one piece which was about inches by inches over mashed potatoes cost i understand small plates but most tapas restaurants plates are at least large enough for people to share at best the food is bland and not worth the prices they charge i certainly hope they rework the food i dont mind paying more for really good food but i do mind being overcharged for poor food i dont normally compare one restaurant to another since each should be able to stand on their own but honestly firefly is hands down so much better poor service from the moment we walked in the door no hostess available so we stood there waiting i noticed the hostess cleaning a table in the corner of the restaurant she looked up saw us standing there and went back to cleaning the table there were quite a few clean empty tables already so i dont think continuing to clean that table was imperative were finally shown to a table by a server and given menus waited at least minutes then busboy asked for drink order then brought us our water a different waiter showed up no intro and just said what can i get you we ordered and he zipped away food was not very good at all except for calamari plate presentations were terrible sauces slopped in the serving dishes no garnishes smudge marks just thrown together they overcharged us dollar for the sauteed mushrooms and when i brought it to the attention of the waiter he was like aahhh ookaay ill tell the manager as if my issue was petty and undeserving brought us the check and still hadnt corrected the price overage stating that he did tell the manager i can only assume the manager didnt think the change was a big deal either i have to guess because i never saw a manager too bad i wanted this to be a good place to go since we live right up the street but i guess we will need to continue to patronize firefly for our spanish tapas fix ate here again and read some of the more negative reviews here as well and was confused but only for a little bit this time here we ordered appetizers weve had before like the ahi it was rather bland and definitely not as good as the past visits the seafood soup was mediocre at best as well it would seem perhaps that different cooks are preparing different days and some of them are better than others perhaps the consistency seems to be rather poor and after the last visit were unsure of visiting again im not claiming that toros has the best tapas in town but they are good enough for me to come back ive been here just twice and im a fan heres what you get at toros smoke free tv screens a lot of them and perfect for the game great service spacious joint inexpensive mini dishes i e tapas happy hour specials look for the red star on the menu new establishment not too busy tapas my rankings oxtail my goodness this is good ness its a bit rich but nothing beat their fall off the bone oxtail perfect with rice asparagus grilled to perfection i think i can eat two orders on my own bacon wrapped dates pretty good not sure what was better the bacon or the dates regardless still tasty meatballs not the best that ive had but a good addition if youre looking to add some meat to your diet my opinion the sauce was a little runny theres a lot more that ive tried and a lot more on their menu that i havent tried for now its their oxtail and asparagus that keeps me wanting more thumbs up for price value and selection i live around the corner from this place and was disappointed more on the expensive side for what it actually is came at when it was supposed to open and had to wait awhile before they actually did when the server finally came out she made eye contact but said nothing it has so much potential but with the service and price its just a disappointment just about anything else could be better and its too bad anything else isnt in this shopping center i swear toros and john cutters only stay in business due to the prime location as i read these reviews i can only imagine that there must be some correlation between the quality of food and which night each chef works we went on half priced tapas monday and the only thing that wasnt great was the saffron chickenvery bland and mushy but since it was half priced we mustve ordered different tapas and all the rest were spectacular i recommend the potatoes steak scallop hell even the escargot was pretty good went here last night mondays are the night to go off tapas it was busy but probably because it was on a monday also i liked that there is no smoking they had a pretty good selection of tapas we probably tried about half of them here is the list pil pil shrimp came out sizzling hot in a cast oven pan the shrimp were good sized i think there were five or six shrimp in butter garlic and other seasonings calamari tried both the fried and the grilled i liked the grilled calamari better than the fried decent portion size not huge but it is tapas the calamari was still tender and the grilled had a great flavor and was served on squid ink the fried still good a light batter there was one sauce missing it is supposed to come with marinara and two aiolis but it only had one aoili striped seabass this could easily by a small meal one piece of fish it was still tender i liked the onion and peppers it was served with the fish in itself did not have much flavor stuffed piquito peppers there were two in the order i could have ate a whole plate grilled peppers stuffed with gooey cheese need i say more fried manchego i love cheese curds and this was like the spanish rendition the manchego was a little salty but manchego is there are three wedges provided it was tasty but a bit greesy i may skip this in the future pan bohli two pieces of breach with serrano ham and cheese on it good a little greasy as they grilled the bread but nothing really noteworthy so i probably would skip this again i cant remember the name but sausage on potato the waitress recommended this it was good but i would probably not get this again there were four servingspieces the sausages were about an inch long and although they had good flavor they were a little tough they were sitting an a small mound of mashed potatos the normal tapas price ranged from approximately for the size of the items i think the price is a little high for the amount you get but for days it is a steal we also got a pitcher of red sangria it was okay but not very sweet and had a more prominent wine taste than you normally get in most sangrias i prefer it to be a bit sweeter i was also impressed that they had estrella beer on draft the only place i have seen it and for a oz poor which is good their wine list was also reasonably priced and although small they had some decent wines not the normal chateau st michelle etc you always see i cant remember the list but i noted that they had tobin james cab the waitress was nice and the food came out quick also they have half off sangria on thursdays and happy hour from pm and pm am with off tapas and drink discounts for beer wine and well overall i liked it here for the price i would come back on mondays or during happy hour go elsewhere service is mediocre at best food is bland firefly down the street is much better came in on a saturday night crickets we were the only ones there the door is off to the side so glad it was propped open as we wouldnt have know it was open music going immediately greeted by bartender ordered the pomegranate fizz something it was awful pomegranate juice instead of syrup would have made all the difference i think my husband wanted a beer they only have one on tap and dont offer dos equis amber strange since there a spanish bar we also tried they sangria sunrise that was tasty the bartender was great and made lots of suggestions we must have brought a good vibe because after about of being there it started to fill up all the while he was on point with everyone we ordered a siracha chicken sandwich on their reverse happy hour menu it was basically a chicken sandwich with siracha on it it was gross so the menu needs work but bartender was attentive and suggestive with out being pushy also gaming machines all around the bar way too many i dont gamble so when theres a lot of machines it makes me feel like im taking up someones spot i think they could take out half of them and still have a great flow of gaming i dont know if its offered but maybe some live entertainment on the weekends we in summerlin love a spot we can lounge eat and drink with live entertainment we ordered items from the tapas menu and all i can say is why was everything luke warm tried the seared calamari based on other reviews and it had no flavor despite all the dark sauce on the plate this place kinda blows its pretty on the inside the service is pretty weak the food is always lukewarm doesnt really have that fresh taste quality ive gone twice now and the only appealing part was the rice pudding sucks because john cutters is always on point terrible food quality and very disorganized very disappointing went to toros for a dinner on a friday night service was good but could have been better i had to flag our waiter down for utensils which werent on the table but no big deal in other tapas restaurants im used to the waiter coming over pretty frequently to check if you want anything else since they are small plates we ordered an array of tapas including the padron peppers pil pil shrimp and ox tail we also ordered the pork sandwich the peppers were tasty but i probably wouldnt order again the pil pil shrimp was excellent lots of flavor and cooked very well i would skip the ox tail next time although it was done well the sandwich was terrible dry with no sauce on it we ended up dipping it in the pil pil shrimp sauce which wasnt bad but definitely do not order this we will probably be back to check this place out again but it wont be a regular dining experience for us even though its close to home my hubby and i go out for happy hour once a month on fridays i get off work early and we head to a new place by or so having read a few positive reviews and since this place is pretty close to our home we thought why not the weather was in the high s today and nothing is as good as a cool crisp sangria on a warm spring day of course the sangria has to have some flavor which this one did not our server was good and very attentive the place was pretty empty but it was so it was to be expected we asked our server for some recommendations and ordered the bacon wrapped dates the scallops the sliders some shrimp and the peppers everything was just ok the dates were not as good as fireflys and we only received of them the scallops had a sauce made with cinnamon that was a little off putting and the shrimp were way over cooked and had zero flavor i couldnt talk my husband into eating the last slider either our bill was which is pretty expensive considering how small all the portions were it was also supposed to be happy hour but they only discount their tapas off the regular price all in all not a place wed return to again next time im in the mood for sangria im heading back to firefly awesome place just dont order the food love the atmosphere love the service shout out to ron you are the best love the gaming love the music love the picking my own utensils from the mason jar but the food aaaarrgh toros i want you to succeed but you need to step up your game with the food the reviews about your food being lukewarm and bland are absolutely true the only thing you have going for you now is a captive audience i e those of us who live nearby and appreciate a place close to home where we can hang out on a weekend night i tried you when you were new and the food was well lukewarm and bland the service was okay i held off on writing a review and decided to give you a second chance a few months later figuring you needed some time to work out the kinks the service has greatly improved but the food ugh how can you mess up chicken i ordered both the saffron chicken and the roasted chicken they were horrible i took them home and fed them to my dogs thats expensive dog food as i write this review i am stuffing my face with a bag of popcorn from costco to get the ewe feeling out of my stomach anyway the lukewarm and bland food will eventually drive people away youve got one more shot toros before i throw in the towel dont get me wrong ill still show up occasionally to gamble drink sangria and hang out with ron but i will not order any food wow this was our first time eating here we loved it everything was great the service but even better was the food a must have is the bacon wrapped dates for sure the paella valenciana the shrimp in the paella was perfectly cooked chef oscar sanchez even came around to greet the patrons a job well done my go to lunch and dinner spot near home i have been here about or times now and have figured out the best things to order beef tenderloin with chimichurri sauce asparagus with romesco sauce spanish chicken wings go on monday for half price tapas skip the drinks unless its happy hour though finish your meal with the lava cake its to die for wow this was our first time eating here we loved it everything was great from the service to the drinks and the food was even better a must have is the bacon wrapped dates the paella valenciana the shrimp in the paella was cooked perfectly chef oscar sanchez even came out to greet the patrons while food is good the service experience is unacceptable no hostess available and we were sat down by one of the servers the server took minutes to greet us at the beginning since we had time to analyze the menu we were ready to order drinks as well as food we had calamari needed a few more seconds in the fryer cantimpalitos excellent tortilla good scargots probably canned sauce was great bread service was good skip the sangria saince it was weak and watered down back to service not even one table check we had to waive for service for several minutes while being ignored by several staff members we ordered round two of tapas no table bussing or drinks offered without going into technical service issues the staff need to be trained in genuine customer service smiling and general hospitality were completely absent from the place server was obviously in the weeds without a busser or assistant for the entire table turn will i be back maybe for an order to go the food was great but even for tapas too small half price tapas can always make a manic monday better monday eves my bff and i try to drop by and sit at the bar to catch whatever game is on maybe play a game or two and savor comp drinks and half priced tapas our favs include the seared salmon served atop a bed of spinach and drizzled with a bechamel sauce omg i refuse to share this plate with anyone the arroz con pollo savory rice with tender chicken and whatever else calls to me bff smacks her lips at the sight of this ahi dish she requests and licks her fingers and plate after devouring her salty peppery garlicky seared shrimp its been fairly busy the mondays weve been there and a bonus is that either she or i is usually lucky at the video games so its an inexpensive fun dinner background music is great the staff is always friendly and welcoming plus service is prompt what i really love and appreciate is that its a non smoking environment and i dont leave there smelling like an ashtray maybe to attract a clientele all nights and to keep things rolling through the week the owners should promote a happy hour every week day not just mondays took awhile for our server to come take our orders only ordered a barcelona sandwich and everyones order came before mine even other people who got there after us my sandwich ended up taking minutes to come out to me and it didnt have the cheese that the menu said it was supposed to have so i sent it back to get cheese and when it came back out half the bread was missing and replaced with a piece of sandwich bread asked to speak to the manager who was not even there so the head chef came out and was telling us how they are usually slow on sundays and ran out out a lot of stuff i told him i was not paying for my meal turns out he comped our whole meal never going there again our awesome server manny g was great with the service and was even better exposing us to new drinks new drinks that were not in the menu were a treat my friends and i return to restaurants constantly due to their cocktails and food but mind you the cocktails keep us coming thank you manny for the great drinks we of us hope we see these in the menu soon thanks so much firefly this place really got my taste buds going everything they brought out was so incredibly delicious i found this place on groupon immediately checked yelp for reviews decided to try it due to my undying love for tapas it was worth of food for toros is actually a gaming restaurant as well i do appreciate that its a non smoking gaming restaurant that actually why i gave this place star rating instead of a cocktails when you text toros to you can get a free drink so i did my first cocktail was strawberry bojito it tasted like a mojito im a fan my second drink was a white sangria oh gosh worse sangria i ever had lol only bad thing about this whole review was that darn white sangria for foods stuffed piquillo peppers it was stuffed with crabmeat and goat cheese swimming in a tomato sauce but it only comes out with peppers as seen on my picture so when it came out me the beau looked at each other like thats it but boy was it delicious sliders those were cute i didnt really think anything special about it only thing different about it is it had a slice of ham in it which added a bacon effect to it seared salmon one of the best salmons i ever had it came out with sauteed spinach which was so good it was laid on a garlic sauce which was oozing with flavors meatballs it comes with juicy meatballs nothing really to say but it was delicious buffalo wings of course everywhere we go we the beau always has to get buffalo wings these were really spicy and it came out with a spicy aioli dipping sauce that really made those chicken wings memorable flan for dessert my favorite it was the perfect amount of sweetness and was the perfect size to end our meal the waitress was new but she had a lot of knowledge about the items she was honest about not trying most of the foods yet but gave us direction on popular items she came to check on us regularly and when our food was taking long she would go see what the hold up was she was a doll i really like the deco of this place but the service and quality of the food didnt justified what i had to pay we had to remind our waiter two out of five orders did not come food quality was average i live one mile away of this tapas wouldnt go there again the tapas were all good nothing really wowed us we did try their tequila rice pudding and loved that they sugar carmelize the top like a creme brulee what takes this to stars is the service we like many reviews went with a groupon unfortunately during happy hour i asked to speak to the manager and he agreed to put in our order after happy hour ended in the computer so we could use the groupon that was a customer service after that experience we will return thank you we ordered a few items on the tapas menu food is okay although some of the items reminded me of julian serranos menu the execution was decent but the food didnt taste very good one thing though i noticed the other reviews mentioned how small the portions were yet all of the items we ordered came in huge portions youre probably better off going elsewhere for tapas great casual atmosphere we had the sangria escargot paella and tequila rice pudding everything was excellent it was my first time having escargot and it didnt disappoint chef oscar came around and spoke with us we even added him to our facebook great to speak with a chef with such passion about his food a rating of would be appropriate since we were there to watch a basketball game i asked the bartender to change the channel on one of the overhead screens and advised our waiter to be prepared for a leisurely dinner we started off with a glass of pinot noir and a fat tire at happy hour prices plus orders of grilled eggplant slices of grilled eggplant topped with goat cheese and tomatoes out of a possible forks bacon wrapped dates forks and pil pil shrimp ct shrimp in a garlic paprika white wine and parsley sauce forks the latter was served on a hot plate and proved to be the best of the tapas though the shrimp were slightly overcooked on the second round we ordered seared salmon over spinach topped with bechamel sauce forks ham croquettes forks and piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese and crab with tomato sauce forks we thought portion sizes were very small given the price and very average quality fortunately i had a groupon my husband and i had dinner here on friday i was very excited as i love tapas and had heard good things we had the pan bohli to start it was very tasty we also had the beef tenderloin with the chimichurri sauce the sauce was quite good and the tenderloin was good but overcooked we ordered it medium rare and it was well done we also had the croquetas and the brava potatoes the coquetas and potatoes were good but the sauce which came with both was too spicy the service was very good our server was friendly and the food came out very quickly i would say that if you plan on sharing items most items are for people only the atmosphere is open and comfortable there is a big bar with gaming the cocktail i ordered was so so it tasted of tequila but not much of anything else i would definitely go back and try different items on the menu i live right near here had seen it go up and never went to it randomly decided to take the lovely special lady friend out to dinner and chose this place needless to say we were both very impressed the service was outstanding and friendly the food was outstanding we shared one of the huge paella dishes fresh and outstanding and had a few drinks and a salad pretty damn pricey but nice to eat well and not have to be super decked out nawmean the live music is a really nice touch and the overall vibe of the place is great definitely not the kind of place id go to every weekend but for special occasions it is awesome nothing at this place was good except for the company which i brought the paella is not worth a penny and the sangria dont get me started i dont know if the food was worse than the drinks or perhaps the do waiter should get the prize save your dough and just dont go the food is very bad always disappointed they removed some items but added some new my review is based on service and in the restaurant industry customer service should above and beyond thats what tips are based off right well in my case my server took a few mins too long to greet our table didnt really care for us our food came she didnt even ask us if we liked it or how was it she didnt even top off our waters she was passing my our table and didnt stop once and she would be either her coworkers by the register chatting away this is tapas plates get empty fast and we finished and waited for some interaction from her i was so irritated i had to speak to a manager who then only offered drinks she allowed the same server to serve and she was now being rude in purpose for a friday night that was only maybe tables with people they were having bad customer service as if they were a full house and short staffed sad to say i wont go back in particular to this location i got better customer service at old firefly that has a wait and elbow to elbow tables that are full the atmosphere and ambience was also bad too bright no music until i addressed why theres no music it was awkward service was great food was either bland or too salty sangria is tasty entertainment was great nobody seemed to notice but us would come back for sangria and entertainment dont really recommend the bacon wrapped dates a little too dry and not a lot of flavor the garlic shrimp where perfect and the ahi tasted as if it were spam from a can i was a little disappointed with the ahi because its usually my fav were ever we go we tried the strawberry bajito yum o bartender took along time to make drinks and there was maybe only four of us in the whole restraint how can you beat super cold beer on the tap ordered the chicken skewers and a chicken tostada salad with my wive and it had amazing flavor i would highly recommend this place love this place the chef comes out to greet you he remembered that i was a gestational diabetic and made sure he made the food for my needs also you can get a gambling card and they give you a free when you hit a credits i hit that in minutes the staff is super friendly the machine are horrible have a drink and run because you cant win i love this place the tapas selection was so yummy i couldnt decide omar our waiter brought my husband i his choices omg absolutely perfect first was bacon wrapped dates then pil pil shrimp oxtail a little later was ahi tuna tenderloin with brie jalapeno margaritas are a must have and the sangria is heavenly after several visits to john cutters next door we were tempted away to toros being a long time tapas fan and with firefly in the news every other week we really wanted to like this place after reading mixed reviews i was concerned and hungry ok more hungry than concerned i have a rule about new places i assume that the servers know whats best i often ask the servers to bring me the best and leave it at that some servers shudder some embrace the challenge some know their menu so well they barely blink before deciding what to bring our server omar was the third type he quickly decided on three items all perfect then two more still perfect what did we have well come on by and ask your server you see our drinks and menu items were tailored to our tastes your experience may be different but i hope equal to our experience i saw a lot of poor reviews from a few months ago but my understanding is that they have a new chef check it out it may be better than you had previously experienced skacey former elite my husband and i went here after a day of looking for houses in the neighborhood loving tapas we fantasized about this being our spot when we bought a house nearby the decor is a little odd flags all around the bar and near or so pier one type tin lanterns with the stars punched out you know the kind booths all in one corner and large enough to fit i personally dont like high tops so sitting here felt super odd we sat waiting for a waitress to come over for about minutes while it wasnt busy at all not the end of the world but something you defiantly note the first time you go somewhere new being a spanish tapas place i ordered chicken nachos and my hubby ordered the chorizo meatballs and bacon wrapped dates all tapas i know that tapas are served as their done but being that nachos are chips on a plate cheese and then into a salamander to melt i totally thought those would be first no wrong all of his dished were served at the same time the bread was brought out like literally less than min after ordering i thought it to be strange at first but upon tasting it was clear this was all reheated food the chorizo was hard like the texture of a giant slim jim that had been left on a counter for a week the dates just rated off almost as if the oil theyd been fried in had dent been changed in quite a long time the meatballs didnt gross me out as the other two did but hey you can keep those sitting in sauce and itll keep well i had moderate hopes for my nachos as they were hopefully freshly prepared being that they were not served immediately nope now its not hard to make nachos as described earlier when i ordered i asked if the optional chicken was shredded or chunks and our waitress said shredded i was expecting the type of cooked in a salsa until the chicken falls apart shred this was like canned chicken sent through a food processor more baby food than shreds in addition to this the plate consisted of chips shredded cheesenot fully melted btw and olives no peppers no salsa no sour cream a plate of chips with cheese olives and chicken so none the less we wont be back i cant see where these good reviews came from we did go on a sunday afternoon so maybe at the slower times you get the crappy food i dont know been here several of times so many times i cant remember the sangria is amazing the tapas are absolutely delicious must try the sliders or anything we love it all service is great it was my wedding rehearsal dinner and i really wanted tapas for all the different tastebuds attending its also sportsvideo poker bar so not a romantic setting but i didnt mind some of my guests wanted to gamble anyway the executive chef oscar sanchez and the manager lisa took real good care of me we went over the menu the timing of the dishes the different diets in our group and i even was able to order dishes not on the menu how accommodating the service was impeccable the prices reasonable and the presentation mouth watering everyone attending was impressed with the entire experience and left with happy bellies thank you toros for taking care of us ill always visit when im in town absolutely love this place the food is great and the service is even better i highly recommend the seared calamari with a side of bread to dip in the ink sauce this last time i tried the paella and it was definitely delicious its enough for at least people so come hungry i have been here twice now first time it seemed expensive so i avoided it for a long time in search of something different we ventured here again and while it wasnt as expensive as i remember the food just wasnt quite on margaritas way too much sour i didnt finish mine that never happens empanadas seemed frozenreheated dates cant go wrong here tasty but only tenderloin from tapas tasty potatoes werent the real deal but i thought it was good enough there was something cheap about the steak corn cakes sugar bomb i honestly didnt taste anything corn about these guys they were dressed with maple syrup seemed more like a pancake the bf enjoyed them so they got a few points all in all tapas are no bueno i will try one more time because i like the area but ill go for an item off the menu sandwich or entre just witnessed a few duck dynasty looking bikers wielding foot long army knives reach over the bar grabbed bottles of alcohol and walked out but it gets better they walked back in sit down at the bar and are getting served shots with waitress female bartender and bus boy manning shop not sure if they saw it or just ignoring it either way i would not recommend bringing your kids or date here on the food braised oxtail is good scallops so so seared prawns were sent back as all of them were mushy and rotting even the buser said it stinks when he took it away this place doesnt seem like it would be around after another few months this is not a good restaurant experience i think this restaurant is about to close ambiance empty restaurant on a wednesday at pm hip hop pop music at spanish restaurant gang members with unconcealed weapons and lit cigarettes in a non smoking restaurant food seafood was rotting and had to be returned even the sangria was poorly made although drinkable rice pudding had decent flavors but was not finished cooking rice was hard and liquid had not yet been absorbed oxtail was good ahi tuna is tasteless fried artichokes are sour and runny service very nice waiters but have not been trained in proper service steps all the tapas came out at the same time and couldnt fit on the table conclusion its not good enough for their price good news is that the next restaurant in this space might be better im not sure how i feel about this place after my one visit on early sunday evening its walking distance from my house and they have an outside sitting option which is a bonus for me if i have my dogs with me its an expansive and varied menu but pricey in my opinion for a neighborhood bar the server suggested the tapas menu on the back since we werent really interested in a meal we ordered a pitcher of sangria for way to high it was about when we got there so we just missed happy hour but really for a local neighborhood bar i would probably be a frequent visitor if that happy hour was all day or even if there were more drink specials available like john cutter next door you can get a free drink by signing up by text for tapas we chose the calamari ceviche and the chicken skewers a complimentary bread basket with dipping sauce was also provided i have no complaints about the food and the tapas were fairly priced the restaurant was larger then it appeared outside but almost empty minus a couple other tables the bar is large and offers gaming so thats an option if youre a fan of that because of its proximity to my house i cant say i will not find myself here again but i will make sure i arrive when happy hour is still in effect most unauthentic spanish restaurant ive ever been to stopped in for a drink and tapas and left after the drink the whole ambiance just isnt there based on other reviews im pretty sure i didnt miss out on a whole lot giving this place one star in order to write my review my bf and i were there on thursday night we were both starving we sat down and were greeted promptly we ordered an appetizer and a few different tapas bacon wrapped dates our favorite tapas came out super hot my bf burned his mouth the bacon was really fatty which explains why it was burnt empanadas had a mushy meat which resembled pureed old shredded beef not good crocketas were deep fried but super soggy how does that happen and who knows what was in them it was supposed to be chicken with bechamel sauce but tasted more like a campbells cream soup wait generic cream soup campbells wouldve actually helped w chunks of who knows what ive had bechamel sauce and that was not it chorizo was served cut into tiny pieces pieces altogether and was so oily that some of the oil ended on my shirt goodbye silk blend piece finally we decided on gnocchi pasta right you cant mess this dish up ive made it myself at home with otc sauce well surprise salty and gnocchi tasted so un fresh i will not return to this place seriously my bf even said he would much rather take his chances on the other more known tapas place then step back in here how is this place still having people come in and order food clearly these people lack a trained palates or maybe they lost their taste buds in a freak incident i went home and i kept wondering what was in those crocketas and empanadas the thought of how old the food was it was too much for me love stopping here for a quick drink and tasty appetizer the gnocchi is consistently spot on delicious friendly prompt service and outdoor patio seating just hold on to your hats on windy days overall i always look forward to winding down here i watched this place sit idle during the great recession and then was so pleased to see something going in there when the economy improved toros spanish kitchen gaming is a good addition to the small shopping center we stopped last night and had dinner i had looked over the menu online but i wanted to look at theirs in house as there were other items than the tapas id seen online our server brought iced tea we had to wait a bit to catch the servers eye to get some sweet n low but eventually we got it the complimentary toasted slices of bread were nice i used it more for a pusher than anything else i ordered three items to startan order of sauteed mushrooms in garlic and sherry wine gnocchi with shrimp in a garlic cream sauce i thought id be able to sneak the shrimp past my wife and last an order of croquetas with ham cream cheese and bechamel the winner of the trio was the gnocchi with shrimp when my wife got to the one shrimp i hadnt been able to screen out with the spoon that was all for her score for me i finished the dish the gnocchi were soft and the shrimp although small were good it was a nice combination next the garlic mushrooms were really good sauteed nicely in garlic and sherry the mushrooms were very good the disappointing dish for me was the croquetas they were very light and had hardly and body to them yet it was difficult to pick them up they broke in half there was not a bechamel sauce but a marinara like sauce we decided not to order more the three dishes were filling well almost we ordered the chocolate lava cake it takes minutes to make the menu states this clearly so if youre in a hurry order early the lava cake was rich chocolate cake with chocolate sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream a nice way to end a good dinner service was spotty our server seemed to be nowhere in sight for much of the time while the server who had the tables on each side of us seemed to be at those tables all the time and the place was not that crowded during dinner the owner came around to ask how things were and the personal touch is always appreciated its also very good business the spotty service kept me from giving toros four stars i thought the pricing was very fair if you subtract the desert we had from the bill the total would equal about what i paid for person at another tapas place and i left hungry two of us ate for the same coast and we left without feeling hunger we need to come back and try some of the other dishes i also need to come back with some friends and without my wife there are items id like to try from the menu that she wont eat her loss time for a uye my husband and i had a groupon for this restaurant and decided to give it a try since we were new to the vegas area we were sorely disappointed when everything we ordered was significantly lacking in flavor i dont even think salt was used on any of the dishes tapas are supposed to be packed with taste bud tickling flavors and that is definitely not what we received i will continue to go to firefly on sahara instead food was ok for nachos with beef added is pricey in my opinion definitely take advantage of the groupon never been to a bar that didnt make strawberry margaritas and never been told we dont make frozen margaritas for a drink and you cant crush ice in the blender wont be going back do not go here brought to you by the same lousy management and food purveyors as john cutter lousy food i am surprised i did not get sick from the fish tiny portions and very little flavor also be careful when you write a bad review about any of the lousy corrigan restaurants because you will get a petty little note from the owner adam c heres an idea if you have bad reviews and poor feedback from guests invest your time and energy into listening and making changes instead of striking back if anyone else gets these messages make sure to avoid their other restaurants john cutter and sedona been here a couple times for tapas and its always been a pretty good experience last night we had the seared scallops padron peppers pil pil shrimp chicken skewers calamari and the lava cake everything is well prepared but i did not care for the chicken skewers because it was not white meat however the lava cake is definitely worth the mins wait btw theres a groupon right now so dont miss out i had a groupon for bucks to spend here so that was a plus the atmosphere was great nice layout very inviting large big screens showing the games the bartender and waitress super friendly and nice the food hoever not so nice we had the garlic shrimp swimming in butter but no flavor the brava potatoes were decent the carne asada street tacos were the best part of the meal but the rice and beans were dry with no flavor we also had the wings and they were eh just tasted like they were rolled in hot sauce and covered in cheese i wont be back poor service and just okay food the tapas were too small to share and nothing was really that great we were excited to hear of a new tapas restaurant in the neighborhood we stopped in excited to try this place before heading to a show only to walk in and discover it felt like nothing more than a pts kind of vibe we sat down at the bar to order a drink and dine the bartender had a bit of an attitude letting us know she was very busy but the place didnt seem that bad we finally ordered one drink but the bartender took so long to come back that we were so turned off by the place we never even ordered food i went here with my dad and wife the food was okay a bit pricy to get everyone full the only bad thing was the prawns they were not deveined love this neighborhood joint they recently revised their menu although i miss some of the old menu their current selections are quite tasty i really love their bacon wrapped dates and tempranillo wine their sliders and stuffed piquillo peppers are worth a try this is a nice causal laid back restaurant for an added bonus they have lots of tvs i will definitely be back for football season positive beer as well lively sports bar atmosphere and decor negative coffee soft drinks and food was not at all good unless they dramatically improved the fare i would not recommend this place to anyone they changed the menu mexican cantina style food delish i think theyve even dropped the prices jalapeno margarita is going to revisit in the morning hot hot oooooo fail ok so its late and youre thinking man i want some food hey that place is open lets check it out we were the only people there to eat others were there chatting up the bartender and gaming guys how in a place with only customers do you serve cold not luke warm but cold tacos chicken nachos were pretty good but cold tacos hey i get it its late but either youre open for business or youre not sorry guys i purchased a groupon for this restaurant specifically because it advertised as serving spanish cuisine the marquee outside still stated it was a spanish kitchen after viewing the menu and talking with the waitress she stated that the spanish menu is gone and that they only serve mexican food the service from the waitress was good the food was just okay we were very disappointed with the erroneous advertisement and lack of spanish food we were expecting first time back since they changed the menu and im happy so far new menu is clean and simple spanishmexican but done right great taco selection and go to mexican favorites much more reasonably priced and i no longer feel overwhelmed so i got the chimichanga crispy and well presented love the spicy and tangy red sauce that covers it all overall just a great flavor lets me know i definitely need to come back and explore the menu some more what an interesting place we stopped here for lunch on our way out to red rocks park excuse my surprise as im not from vegas but it was interesting to see gaming here this is a pretty good restaurant with some interesting tapas we decided to just be surprised and let the waitstaff bring us whatever i think the arepas were the highlight the bacon wrapped dates were interesting but perhaps a little weird to eat hot dates we were there before they changed their menu and were a tapas restaurant before the food was delicious and since theyve changed it its horrendous my bf got the chimichunga and he said it was just a bunch of meat and cheese that they rolled up to make it a big burrito he said it tasted like nothing no flavor i got the shrimp taco which also tasted like nothing but i can taste the chared shrimp i also got the fish taco and del tacos fish taco is actually better than theirs and finally got their veggie taco our waitress said the veggie taco was her favorite it had no taste whatsoever it was basically a bunch of meat and cheese and veggies made to fit in a taco oh our appetizers was plain nachos and it taste like pepperoni pizza rolls with guacamole and sour cream on top the pizza rolls itself taste better than their nachos it seems like they fried their chips and then added cheese and baked it and then added the pico guacamole and sour cream overall the place was better as a tapas spanish restaurant and before they changed their menu we will not be going back to toros vibe is great in here a mix of an american sports bar with delicious mexican food clean restaurant with a friendly staff i ordered fish tacos and black beans both were very different than ive ever had but im not complaining definitely going to become a regular to this place pleasantly surprised with the new menu thank you much better than what it was the happy hour tacos were excellent as was the shrimp ceviche food was cold and not true spanish tapas would never go back even with a groupon no windows which made me feel like i was in a dungeon man what a disappointment went in for tapas and they changed their menu to mexican food nothing special about the food here anymore just another mediocre mexican joint in vegas i will not be returning the tapas were excellent with lots of variety and flavors sad to see the menu change wow just wow never again theres just to much to say was never given happy hour prices was out of different beers was told i had to buy a bowl of guacamole for when all i wanted was aside for a draft beer the manager words to me were sorry you feel that way worst mexican food ive ever had actually worst restaurant food of any kind it is cheap but you could spend the same at taco bell and have a bit better food not kidding our friends warned us it sucked his words but we stayed big mistake dont waste your time came with a co worker for lunch everything was really good carne asada nachos had a large amount of meat and had a lot of flavor had pork sopes which were even better had good spice lots of meat cooked perfectly im saving the best for last the tacos i had a barbacoa taco my friend had the pork al pastor the flavor on both was amazing service by dusty was really good especially since it was just her and a runner next time will be for happy hour enjoy great neighborhood spot for drinks and snacks on the patio its not our go to spot for dinner even with the new menu but you cant beat the beer wine and taco prices during happy hour we love to stop by any night of the week for a quick drink and let our little one burn off some energy running around the patio service is a little slow outside but once you let them know you need help theyre always friendly and accommodating manager was very nice when we had an issue with the bill well continue to go here and probably give dinner another try eventually but for now we love the happy hour we also enjoy the occasional live entertainment went back to toros for dinner tonight had a groupon and at the end of the meal they tried to tell me that alcohol isnt covered by the groupon so be careful because it doesnt say that anywhere on the mobile app quit disappointed since we love the food and diana took awesome care of us im not a huge gambler but ill put in throughout the night when i go somewhere me and friends went in and had a total of drinks between all of us and two orders of tacos and a quesadilla tacos were good but the chicken quesadilla came out as all sauce and peppers very little cheese or chicken the bartender grabbed me another that was considerably better than the first because of this the bartender said this drink is on me i was appreciative of this but other than this i saw the bartender on his personal phone taking a call times and didnt seem to care when i had a cash out ticket waiting at all like i said im not a huge gambler but i put in a total of and playing blackjack went up and down quite a bit while playing the check comes all drinks were charged for except for the one he took care of many better gaming spots to go to than this good service and gaming is found elsewhere the food is amazing very authentic i felt like i was in the heart of mexico our server john was more than kind and very a tentative loved the tocos and the bowl was a very innovative homemade torrtillas chips i was thrilled with the meat selection and the red and green salsa well be back for sure the worst service so slow over minutes just to get a menu another to get drinks then another just to get food oh wait we never got our food because the server said i had to be patient translation youre going to get your food whenever its ready we finally walked out since we never got anything never again we originally went waaaaaaaaaaaaaay out here because of a groupon the tapas were amazing and thoroughly enjoyable of course they got rid of tapas and went with a new mexican menu because if theres one thing las vegas needs more of in the dining scene its less diversity and more mexican food everything sounded great but every single thing we ate felt like it was missing one ingredient they tried to get all artsy fartsy with the menu and it turned into swing and a miss the first batch of chips we had was not just salty it was more like oh my god how can any human being put an entire roman centurion months worth of salt on one basket of chips the head waitress was adorable and very wonderful shes the only reason they get two stars if youre the owner of this place getting rid of tapas was a horrible idea feel free to let us know when you reinstate it then well happily give you more of our money for a bar with a restaurant it is great greeted at the door quick attentive service but wait the best at the last we had fajitas of the steak type and they were delicious and super fast to the table margarita great beer well thats beer chips and salsa great highly recommend stopping in bring back the tapas why give up a concept that you executed well to embrace one that you dont service is great and drinks good so if that is all you want this is a nice neighborhood place dont go for the food chips are too thick the kinds of salsas are tasty tried kinds of tacos none were good black beans were the best dish we had this is absolutely the worst tapas turned mexican rest in the valley luckily we had a groupon we ordered the guacamole which we were told isnt made until its ordered which was a lie because it was freezing cold and had a brownish tinge to it it was also covered in cotija cheese so the flavor was that of cheese my husband ordered fish tacos but was served shrimp tacos sent those back and received the fish tacos which state on the menu that its fresh tilapia tasted anything except fresh and there was a inch piece of fish covered in cabbage and lettuce absolutely the worst taste ever tasted like it was thawed from the freezer we tried this place once when they served tapas and it was less than mediocre found out it was owned by john cutter next door food quality is very poor dont waste your money even if its a groupon went there the other day the food was great i had the sopes and shrimp empanadas it was delicious i would definitely go back chef ricky makes the best fish tacos chix adobado shrimp empanadas huaraches with oz stk sopes nachos papas freitas with cheese queso modelo i recommend this restaurant great staff definitely coming back i love this place so much i always get the chimichanga and let me tell you its so amazing my wife always gets the ceviche its so so amazing perfect amount of lime and spices its so good also theres such nice people this one girl i think her name is melissa or michelle i know shes new her attitude is amazing she always comes with a smile and my chips which they are made fresh every day im getting hungry just thinking about i recommend this to anyone who loves a kick back place robin jessica and gene are awesome good gaming bar jessica and robin all about making perfect drinks and very attentive and gene took the time to teach me how to game a new game get a glass of cava enjoyed spending thanksgiving with the toro crew dedicated to working on a holiday eve jen niki took super good care of us thank you dustylee turned on the mixologist in her and made some super yummy pitchers of cocktails perfect for everyone our waitress was very personable helped us finalize our beer and food choices all delicious especially the chicken fajitas enjoyed watching a football game too ive been here three times and held back writing a review the first time only because i saw many subpar reviews but after my third visit i have to write about this place because they deserve it toros has some great food but it really depends on what you order there are definitely dishes that are a hit or a miss after looking at the menu for a few moments our server returned quickly and asked us if we wanted to put in our order early she said there was a party of that has been seated but wanted to put our order in first so we wouldnt need to wait so long wow now that is some great service the interior is pretty cool and doesnt look too much like a restaurant or a bar but a neat combination of the two while youre waiting they serve you chips and salsa the chips have that authentic home made crunch and taste im pretty sure they make it in the restaurant and are terrific the carna asada tacos are to die for not only do they taste amazing they are like each of these and youll be pretty filled dont get the fish tacos because they were less than stellar if you want seafood then get the shrimp tacos i ordered the carne asada bowl and for the price you get a pretty big bowl the ingredients taste really fresh and appetizing the best part is all the food came out in less than minutes not only was the service great but speedy for two people the bill only came out to and i was stunned because it felt like we ate a meal worth twice that since moving to the summerlin area this is the first place i talk about when people ask me about dining ive been here three times and they have exceeded my expectations each time ive been will definitely recommend im not sure how this place stays open the idea of the tapas sound yummy but their food isnt very good at all its a wanna be firefly type restaurant with a sports bar atmosphere i ordered the bacon wrapped dates and a few other tapas the bacon was almost raw my girlfriend ordered something with shrimp the shrimp plate was a tapas plate with shrimp my girlfriend ate one shrimp and didnt like it sent the plate back ive been here a few times with groupons i doubt ill ever return their drinks were ok but not worth the trip had our employee holiday party here staff was great about organizing our event on short notice location is decorated on a dia de los muertos theme with rustic wooden benches and chairs and hanging lanterns food was solid variety of nachos taquitos quesadillas and enchiladas available along with churros for dessert as for the drinks the sangria has an interesting spice to it but the margaritas were the major hit of the evening not a place id rush back to but nice and dark for a quiet date night or some late night snacks and drinks with friends its a bit out of the way for me personally experience having an event here was a positive one was quite surprised to enjoy a very tasty carne asada torta the other day it came with hot and tasty fries too good sandwich nice atmosphere generous portions and great service was here mid day so cant speak to the vibe at this place which is open until am stars but lets be honest those stars are all for the food the food here is delicious well prepared and would make for a great and affordable lunch dinner or hh whether its the taco plate or the chicken enchiladas go with the red chili sauce the green couldnt be more mild youll be in good shape eating here that being said the service was absolutely horrible its a sunday afternoon and there are four parties outside and about four inside two servers one bartender one busser still took ten minutes after seating for the server to come to take a drink order we then ordered drinks and a side of a guacamole to have in advance which came out right away but no chips we ask the busser for chips and she says shell be right back minutes go by ask the other server she says she has to get our server to help us out more minutes finally one of us just go back to the server and ask for chips to eat the guacamole with what was really obvious and kind of pathetic in the above scenario is that the servers and bussers arent working together they seem to be competing and when that competition ruins a good meal it encourages me to advise others not to waste their time there i wish they still did the spanish tapas thing but now they have a mexican menu if youre looking for authentic mexican food you can do a lot better than this place the chips they gave us to munch on had a burnt aftertaste i ordered the taco plate and the rice was bland and tasteless the beans were overly salty and the taco meat wasnt seasoned properly overall a very disappointing experience the only reason im rating two stars instead of one is because our server was friendly great food good music dusty lee gene slinging great drinks what more can you ask for when the weather is right they have a nice patio for dining al fresco also lets start with the drinks the margaritas are in no way authentic tasting they taste as if they are premixed and purchased at your local grocery store the sangria was not a sangria but rather a wine put on ice with a few diced apples added moving on to the service the host had zero personality and mumbled everything our server was pretty good but the food took at least minutes to get out for mexican food that is far too long the salsa with the chips and salsa tasted store bought the only redeeming quality was the chips they were good the entrees were pretty bad if you are looking for authentic mexican food drive far away from this place if you are looking for sub par mexican food then this is the place for you the tortas tasted like greek gyros the tacos were ok the carnitas was seasoned well the shrimp was masked by globs of guacamole and the carne asada was dry and tasteless the fajitas were good but they provided way too few tortillas and too small of tortillas then had the audacity to charge for extra will not return to this place this place was great the first weeks of been a spanish tapas bar the down hill when you see that the bartender is promoted to cheff woooo red flags star popping up now is a mexican place way diferent the quality is unmentionable the services is a joke been here several times and love it the veggie tacos are my favorite thing on the menu i am not a vegetarian but these are seriously good chips are hot and fresh salsa is great green is a bit sweet and red is just right service was good atmosphere was good food was fantastic the chicken tinga taco and the carne asada taco are two of the best tacos ive ever eaten and they were only a piece the staff was very welcoming of both me and my dog the outside patio is a great spot for casual dining not sure why there are and star reviews for this place i had an entirely positive experience we really love this place the food is fresh and flavorful and the wait staff delightful after a hike at red rock canyon this is our goto spot came here thinking it was still a tapas restaurant its not its now a full mexican restaurant and bar food was ok nothing spectacular at least the tortilla chips and green sauce were the highlights as it was different mexican food than what i am normally used to it was unique that the beans were black beans and that the rice seemed more like spanish rice even though the waitress stated that toros is mexican now this must be a good place to watch sports games as they had football jerseys all over we tried toros for the first time last night we are regular at john cutters but wanted to try something new we were all pleasantly surprised by both the quality of food and level of service we sat outside and spenser took care of us the service was attentive and he made great recommendations the food was also very good all four of us ordered different items and we all thought they were delicious we had to take one star away for the lack of some traditional mexican favorites combo platters cheese enchiladas but all in all this was a very good dining experience and we will certainly return i should of known better an empty mexican restaurant on a friday night is never a good sign i got the taco plate tacos carne asada shrimp and barbocoa black re fried beans and rice the carne asada didnt have any flavor and the tortillas tasted stale and cold the rice and beans was just as disappointing my wife got the carne asada fries the fries werent salted and soggy meat was dried and had no flavoring and the cheese the cheese was the worst part cheese tasted like it came from a cheese wiz bottle man that was the worst part lastly my sister got the ceviche that came out brown and looked nothing like ceviche i could never recommend this place sad to say great atmosphere but the food is awful please please please put as much effort into the food as the decor place looks great tequila shrimp salad was or tough must have been frozen shrimp on a chopped head of iceberg no flavor but the sugar in the dressing it was horrible margarita was like a grocery pre mix protein burrito bowl was as one note as the salad even the salsa and beans needed salt my husband went here on a whim despite the reviews he asked for crunchy tacos for me they made one crunchy and the rest soggy and soft not good the flavored were strange and they didnt seem to compliment each other all around the service wasnt good and neither was the food we are here on vacation and will not return to this restaurant so many other great choices here in vegas save your money and go elsewhere very happy with this place our server diena was really good we had a party of ten six kids four adults all with different orders our server got it perfect the food was really good value was much better than then expected i didnt care for the choice of music in the background or the gaming at its he bar restaurant was very clean we will visit again next year when we are in town i do recommend this place arrived at toros not knowing what to expect walked in the door and was promptly greeted by dusty lee was almost stunned at how friendly the service was she immediately asked what i wanted to drink and i was served quick my friends arrived a bit later and we all enjoyed a great time at the bar gene the manager was great thumbs up for toros food was amazing got the tacos and the ceviche our bartender dusty was awesome great personality and very personable highly recommended this place stopped on the way back from red rock and wow amazing food for just running across it roadside bathrooms exceptionally clean big booths nice decor super friendly service i had the taco salad with steak so yummy my husband had three tacos he said the they were all great and different but the chicken one was in a super good sauce the rice was really flavorful awesome we had dinner at toros it was truly amazing the food was very good lots of flavor great presentation and portions are big and chef ricky has a heart for his talents thank you good food and great service the cucumber margarita was so refreshing the chicken and carne as ads tacos and protein bowl were great the portions are large enough to share easily i love this place happy hour could be expanded but its way decent the chicken tinga taco amazing beer prices for happy hour amazing the service incredible we went for a celebration in my dads memory and dusty lee was our bartender orlando was our waiterbar back i cant say enough about how attentive they were and when they realized what we were gathering in memory of they just made it more special when strangers go out of there way to make your dads memory special i dont care if its your job thank you im coming back again the food was great done by chef ricky service was excellent given by laura and the margaritas were delicious laura took the time to explain the menu was extremely welcoming and knew what she was doing chef ricky we will be back to try your great food its a min drive but well worth it ive been here twice now both times with friends and our kids we love sitting outside and letting them run around and play the kids meals are tasty and only or since they are pretty large portions its enough food for us to share a meal with them score there are lots of specialty cocktail options beer and wine its a nice place to sit talk and enjoy an adult beverage or two the servers are attentive the food comes out quick no complaints on customer service here excellent service food was great pricing very affordable i mentioned to the waitress i felt it was little rice on my order and she when back and served me more at no cost glass water was refilled without asking and that to me is a big plus i sat on the patio for minutes at one of the tables clearly belonging to toros without being served a server walked right by me twice while waiting on the only other occupied table this is the second time ive left this restaurant for this reason two tries in a year to eat here there wont be a third love this place delicious menu with healthyish options strongly recommend the pork al pastor anything great staff always attentive friendly offer bar atmosphere with games fights etc and its not offensively loud also have live music on specific nights this is my local watering hole to visit the employees are wonderful and fun dusty really knows how to bring the energy to the bar i have had a couple of food items and have enjoyed how they tasted used to come here it was excellent not true anymore the shrimp fajitas for had shrimp you needed glasses to see they forgot our quesadilla and then brought it out wrong i got up to ask for my own chips and then they charged for pico de gallo prices are too high for bad food and service to bad the old chef left we wont be back my wife and i went to toros for dinner it was very inviting they had the football games on and it was lively and happy but not too crazy or loud we ordered a couple tacos chimichanga and churros that were all good churros were the best also had dogfish on tap the best about the whole dinner was the service rene took great care of us she was nice personable and made sure we had everything we needed so im writing this review after sitting here for minutes with a menu in front of me and no one has bothered to even take our drink order we are in plain site but no one even came to check on us they are not even busy at all several people came after us and got service but they ignored us probably because we werent a big party so after having time to consider their overpriced food i will go somewhere else and actively tell people not to go here before leaving i went in and told the wait staff we would be leaving because we didnt receive any service and they were hardly even concerned read rude at least i got to eat a basket of their gross greasy chips for free we wont be back here or to their equally overpriced and meagerly less than average sister restaurant john cutter if you want overpriced greasy bar food dont miss john cutter not sure how it is when dusty lee is not here but when she is stars she makes everything better so kind great smile and dusty lee makes everyone so welcomed dusty is great always a funny story and the drinks are amazing get the protein bowl with chicken very sweet bartender didnt catch her name but shes blonde and does ladies night every tuesday and you get a free gift if youre a female love this place its very trendy inside and its always a fun environment although i do wish theyd switch up their music once and a while but regardless awesome place to hang great food great staff shawne kelly gave me good luck won a little money and had some great drinks ask for shawne next time your there i went late so im guessing late shift is his good food and great service every time i have gone it has been pretty empty but i believe they have bands on weekends that is like to check out sometime such a nice restaurant we randomly found this place on our way back to mandalay bay from red rock we were sick of the overpriced and crowded restaurants on the strip and im so glad that we stopped in the food was awesome a big plate of chips to start with free bean dip guacamole and salsa verde we were full after just the chips our taco plates were pretty big and really delicious the shrimp taco was my favorite service was exceptional too our waiter was really friendly and attentive there was a little mix up with our order which he fixed right away and with no charge the restaurant itself is really pretty the bathrooms especially as weird as that sounds wed definitely come back if we were in the area went to toros after red rock to eat and watch some football we had chicken nachos and each oder two tacos chose carne asada chicken tinga and pork pastor the pork was the bomb shouldve got two of those instead of tinga the oil was old and the chicken was fried corn tortillas not good the nachos and pork pastor made up for that the staff and atmosphere is very friendly our waitress was diana super nice and friendly diana did offer to get another chicken taco for us to make it right we were full so didnt take her up on the offer it was nice she was empowered to fix it thanks diana we will be back because of great servers like you and fun atmosphere we came to toros mid day on a saturday to use a groupon the place was semi full at the bar maybe full and had about other tables other than the bar the rest of the seating was high top tables with bar chairs the overall feel was stripmall there wasnt much in the way of mexican decor a few pieces here and there and a dia de los muertos couple prop at the hostess stand we sat quickly and our server was there before we could even get to page of the menu we opted for a couple margaritas while we decided on our food the drinks were a bit sweet but tasty right amount of salt and enough tequila to taste i went with the chili verde and the wife did the chili rellenos i have had chili verde in quite a few places as it is one of my favorites this one was a little weak in the meat department but the tomatillo influence was definitely there it comes with a cilantro pesto type rice and black beans the crispy onions seemed a bit weird but its just a garnish in the end i mixed it all together in a bowl and added the salsa and beans from the chips on the table not too bad but i was still seeking meat overall it was good just not fabulous pricing is on par was most other places so no worries there according to my better half the rellenos were good they were filled well cooked great and tasty she and i had worked on the chips and salsa quite a bit so she opted for eating one chili and taking the rest home i know she enjoyed the second one that night as i finished what i had brought home again price was right on target as most other places overall toros is a good place to come to the food is tasty the service quick and courteous and the drinks pretty good check for any coupons that may be out there the chips and bean dip were good although the red and green salsas were bad they were not salsa the red salsa tasted kind of like barbecue sauce and bacon the tomato soup was very good our entrees were disappointing my husband had the green chile relleno and said that it was the only time he had ever ordered that dish somewhere and did not enjoy it i had the cheese enchiladas and was also very disappointing the enchiladas were smothered in the so called red salsa and they were stuffed with an unusual cheese not typically used in mexican dishes the accompanying beans and rice were odd the rice was dyed green and the refried beans were actually pureed black beans they tasted ok but it all looked unappetizing the service from the staff was good as was the atmosphere but the food just wasnt very good great food and service they have a good selection of draft beer their food is terrific starting with the chips and trio of sauces we got shrimp ceviche to start fantastic recommendation by our server then went for the combo plate where you get to chose from other plates a combine the best sounding things or items their relleno is unique in a great way i grew up in california and then moved to texas toros twist on mexican is better than any ive had the place is kinda cheesy looking but the staff gets to know you and keeps your drinks coming kinda in a way reminds me of a cheers bar nice people located right by home they do have the most awesome chips and salsa i love dusty and jessica the two bar tenders i get the most they know what i want the second i walk in the door food here is good and prices are reasonable sat outside super relaxing meal service was what you would expect from a typical restaurant we will be going back again food is awesome make sure you go on a day that dusty lee is working best bartender ever drinks are strong so dont be a lightweight chips and salsa is the best in vegas worth the trip every single time tried this place on a recommendation and we were pleasantly surprised the nachos are amazing and you get a huge portion we also tried the taco plate and they let me sub grilled veggies for the rice and beans so that was fantastic the chips beans salsas were good and the waiter was nice but we definitely lacked in drink refills we will add this one to our date nights for sure ok so my burrito which was cold came with french fries what thats awful the margarita was awful they dont have tostadas at a mexican food place also the happy hour doesnt include margaritas this place was terrible the only reason i gave it starts was my wife enjoyed her veggie tacos food and staff was awesome new favorite mexican place chips were amazing had beef fajitas i was lured here by their match play text offer this place has been on my radar for years and i was excited to finally check it out the bartender who signed me up for their gaming club was helpful and after my guava margarita was in place i was ready for some big winning they have a cool selection of margs and the guava had a nice flavor and was nicely garnished after getting the match play i asked if they had any other promos and she mentioned they used to have a match play promo after earning points they have some different poker games ive not played before and i won so this was a great first visit the decor is standard cantina with outside seating available as well happy hour is advertised as daily from and i wasnt informed of the happy hour by staff but i did my research i may have ordered some tacos as i arrived shortly before so perhaps next time the vibe was more poker bar than restaurant and the music was pretty loud i believe its nonsmoking which is a plus for sure stopped at toros after a long motorcycle ride when i walked in i was anxious to put down an ice cold beer i was greeted by dusty lee part sexy grizzly bear part just bad ass friendly girl before she even knew my name i was downing a shot of whiskey and sipping my cold beer i ordered my food with dusty lees help and everything was perfect as she insisted it would be if your looking for out of this world service from one of the best bartenders i have ever come across and the best damn tacos north of the border then get your over to toros i went here at about pm on a sunday night because most regular restaurants were closed or about to close the restaurant is very dark inside but i enjoyed the music that was played there your traditional top pop hits i was given the late night menu which consisted of several types of tacos a la carte and fajitas after reading other yelp reviews with the issue of food being just warm and not hot i thought that getting the chickenbeef fajitas would ensure the best chances of getting my food hot since it was slow the food came out fast the fajitas come with the fideo soup with noodles and it was just warm not at all hot right behind it however the fajitas were already out and came with corn tortillas they do charge for extra tortillas here but the that come with the entree simply arent enough the portion was pretty good and enough for two people the rice and beans plate was very nice at this point i ask for chips and salsa again as i had asked for it earlier the green salsa especially is excellent the red salsa definitely tasted fresh though in all the experience was good it isnt a place that would be my first choice on any given night but if you select your food wisely you should come out with a decent experience the food and service is wonderful the manager was very accomidating to helping our birthday party my wife and i have been talking about going to toros for dinner for quite sometime lat night thursday we took our partner and his son from holland there for dinner for a thursday night there were quite a few customers there but we were seated right away let the experience begin our server rene was very pleasant and very accommodating and the food wow this was the best mexican food i think we have ever had starting with the presentation and ending with the unending flavors of each dish chef rickys knowledge of cooking everything properly and knowing what works spice wise is unsurpassed we will defiantly be back for more glad i came across toros stopped by on break from work nice bartender great chips n dip loving it went with my friend for a late lunch after hiking red rock canyon they give you re fried beans along with a verde salsa and a regular salsa to start and they are delicious also their guacamole is pretty marvelous too the only slight negative was our waiter forgot a couple of things but he was really trying very hard and he was new so im giving him a break he was very friendly and has a great personality and nobody is perfect food was fabulous really hit the spot went here to kill the hunger after a day of red rocks dusty le and phil hooked us up with some great food and drinks my protien bowl with carnitas exceeded all expectations for taste and price our waitress renee was very courteous and attentive apreciate the clean warm welcoming setting jess our bartender was not only professional and swift she is a real beauty who was very friendly and attentive the beer was cold and my slot machine was paying out my nd trip to toros i shall return i cant even give this place one star the experinece was so bad we stopped by for a late lunch pm on a sunday and while promptly seated order taken and chips delivered we were then completely forgotten for the next minutes our server disappeared and another server was nice enough to hunt him down but the final straw that had us get up and walk out was when our server finally showed up he had no idea our entrees had never come out this place probably had good food the chips and dips were certainly tasty but the service was a train wreck i discovered recently that toros changed from a spanish tapas focus to mexican cantina but it is not at all run of the mill my party of two ordered the quesadilla with shrimp added it was loaded and delicious also had the pork al pastor taco served on a soft corn tortilla which was full of flavor and a sweetness from pineapple orange achiote the list goes on marinade next taco was the ground beef crunchy with carrots and potatoes we got it without the spicy tomato sauce and didnt miss any flavor this place has some other delights we cant wait to try such as sopes a major treat if youve never had them the table near is ordered the ahi tuna ceviche salad which is served as a stack dish and looked super manager dusty lee and server matthew were terrific genuinely caring and upbeat we will be back very soon and will spread the word after a wonderful day at red rock canyon my girlfriend and i decided to try out toros mexican tavern as soon as we walked up to the bar i was not greeted and after min the bartender asked me what i wanted no how are you doing what would you like to drink or a simple hello just a stern look to me i felt unequal after my drink i ordered my food with the same nostalgic server min later my food came i ordered tacos with rice and beans tacos where good but the rice was raw and beans where runny wtf if you call your selves a mexican restaurant i would appreciate it if you get the rice and beans right at least since you lack in customer service never again coming back here only reason this place is still open is the location i rate this place a negative stars stopped here on a whim one night the carne asada tacos are really good and a great price the carnitas are good as well service was great very clean and fast the chips and salsa are very tasty and the flan for dessert is amazing my experience at toros was great we had lunch on the patio which had a great ambiance there was corn hole jenga and it was polaroid wednesday to get your picture with the mariachi band i also wanted to mention our waitress renee was so nice and informative last but not least my tuna ceviche salad was amazing this was the perfect way to relax after a day of hiking at redrock well i obviously ordered the wrong thing because after looking at the pictures posted on yelp it looks like i ate at a different place the food was terrible the chips oily with no salt they serve this soupy bean sauce and a very bland generic salsa sauce with the chips turns out the same beans are what they serve with your dinner after trying some i asked for that traditional simple cup of soup that you really cant screw up when dinner arrived i requested cheese to maybe thicken the beans and add some flavor and it was very fake flavorless cheese the rice is uncle bens with frozen vegetables way too many for my taste this rice did not resemble spanish rice at all the only thing i ate was the shrimp when i first walked in i thought the place looked great and the manager and server april were very nice people the bartender just walked around with a scowl and food in her mouth most of time where i was having nothing to do but really observe the place the three basics i think you expect at any mexican restaurant whether it be authentic or not are decent beans rice chips and salsa they need to work on that as far as the pictures posted here wow i should have looked at those and maybe would have had a better meal regardless i will not eat here again i hope they invest more in their food products because the location is great great food the best service by tony he made sure to make us feel welcomed i will certainly come back here highly recommended fantastic food and service i would recommend the ahi tuna ceviche salad and the mexican corn along with the fantastic sangria i will definitely be coming back here again we came tried toros from a groupon server was fantastic very fun energetic made great recommendations he even brought us a sample of pork al pastor it was delicious the chips were less than ok salsa unimpressive on waiters suggestion i tried pork chile verde hubby tried tacos carne asada pork al pastor veggie my pork his tacos were yummy especially the veggie taco unfortunately the beans rice were bland best night in a long time sat outside and there was a couple of guitar players singing songs we grew up with beautiful night chips and salsa with delicious guacamole only bucks and enough to share had an ascada chimichanga nice heat and enough for friends had the tacos got each can mix with shrimp beef chicken and they loved them drank the margarita with grand marnier and the salt really made it over the top highly recommend for a great date nite no too expensive and the atmosphere perfect i didnt get our waiters name but he was so great and laid back i want to go back tonight wonderful food and our bartender dusty was an absolute pleasure cant wait to return this place is the best the food is call home made and dusty lee is my favorite bartender ever stopped here on our way back from red rocks national park the food was delicious i ordered the carnitas sopas my husband got the al pastor tacos and the kids got the quesadillas my daughter wanted a lemonade which is not on the menu but our amazing server diana made one for her from scratch highly recommend this place there us great food great customer service always a good vibe they make their own chips which are to die for}

{12163, Old Hickory House Restaurant, 6538 N Tryon St Charlotte NC 28213, dirt cheap and very good tony is correct it is not an elegant place but when you want bbq i think this is one of the better places in town this place is tucked in between some junk yards and check cashing places it has no windows and is just a brick rectangle the inside is slightly more appealing with covered wagon light fixtures and saddle gear nailed to the walls the staff is southern and kind of friendly and rude at the same time which in my book is fricken hilarious the menu is laminated and the pork sandwiches are served wrapped in parchment with no plate can you say awesomeness choice of pork or beef bbq sliced or shredded bbq plates available too sopping with delicious bbq sauce vinegary and savory hush puppies you ask hell yeah want slaw you got it buttered texas toast in your face baby just go already i know your mouth is watering side note there are alot of people out there who like to take sides with their food the most famous case of this was the new england clam chowder vs manhattan clam chowder debate which of course sparked the now famous chowder war of the same holds true for barbecue or bbq for short some people like it dry and dip it in sauce and some people like it wet seeped in vinegar its cooked the same way essentially slow taking sides on this issue or any food issue is ridiculous theyre both friggin good and id eat either style of bbq any day consistently the best purist bbq in clt meat is cooked over real wood in a pit i would be proud to have in my home yes i am a bbq freak wife is instructed to have these guys cater my wake mostall the bbq posers these days cook with gas or electricity it aint the same folks before you go into a bbq restaurant drive around back woodpile if not keep driving is the wood neatly stacked if so be suspicious because a fellow smoking meat at am isnt typically neat with his pile does the restaurant only seem to smoke during dinner hours weve got a chain joint near us which cooks electrically but has a smoke emitting stack kinda like a smoke sign i refuse to set foot in the place on principal hickory house does pork beef and chicken the beef and chicken may be good cant say but this is north carolina folks the only bbq worth having in nc is pork never order french onion soup at a chinese place i say go to texas if you want beef as others have said this place is a nondescript brick rectangle in an area of north tryon which has seen better days ever heard of the hidden valley kings lock your car and hide your valuables speaking from personal experience here this is one of those buildings i wish could talk the restaurant obviously started out as a road house of sorts back when this part of the world was out in the woods i bet it has a ghost or two roaming around looks like the kind of place your parents doctorlawyeraccountant met his receptionist for overtime work back in the s personally i am partial to their chopped bbq sammich brunswick stew and hush puppies if youre luckyblessedliving right your sammich will have some crunchy outside in it you can get the sammich with or without slaw your choice i alternate brunswick stew is worth driving across town for i do the hushpuppies are not health food but they are addictive we start out with an order as an appetizer dont know where they come from but they will contribute to my early demise im sure if youre like me and despise mba driven vinyl restaurants hickory house ought to be on your short list this is the place i hold up as the finest example in clt of the way bbq is supposed to be done even if the food wasnt star it is worth a trip just so you can tell your kids about it someday there are fewer and fewer of these places left every day and well all be poorer when theyre gone this is hands down the best pork bbq ive ever had and i like to consider myself an amateur bbq connoisseur as ive eaten at every good local bbq joint in almost every state in the south and some not in the south as well its one of the big reasons i moved to charlotte and everytime a friend comes in from out of town i make sure we go there and no one is disappointed i always get the small pork plate if you want to get the best part of it make sure to ask for the burnt ends dont just order and hope to get some but ask for them specifically easily the most flavourful part of the pig the sweet tea is magnificent i dont trust a bbq joint that doesnt serve it the hush puppies are unbelievable once again probably the best ones ive ever had and the brunswick stew is hands down some of the best slop ive ever had the staff is all very friendly and im my sweet tea never dips below the half full mark i just wish this place would get more business because everytime i go there there are other tables of people there at the most and the restaurant is very spacious the last thing i want is for this gem to go out of business if youre scared off by areas of town that arent the best you probably should go elsewhere there are plenty of other places to eat this isnt the ghetto but it is right next to it if you prefer to have fancy decor and modern furnishings you might want to check out another location not of the old hickory house because i dont think there is one but of some other restaurant mike k s characterization of old bonanza props blowing up is not inaccurate if you need another think of an old time steak house the walls are paneled the interior is dark even the wall sconces which you would probably never hear them called are little covered wagons in the one nod to the current century you might find they do have compact fluorescent bulbs in them it also might be the only way they can keep said covers from bursting into flames over in one corner is indeed the pit or at least some representation of it it is a bit dark inside even well before it gets dark outside so i cant tell exactly what is over there when you order the man i will call the pitmaster gets your order and pulls some meat out of the pit and prepares it for you generally this means chopping it and then you get the freshly prepared meat on the plate right to your table there are a couple of downsides to the old hickory house i personally dont care about the location i lived in an area similar to this for ten years so that didnt bother me it was like going home again but if this is the sort of thing you care about you may want to think twice i didnt really mind the s steakhouse kitsch but it could use a bit more light not saying they need an atrium or skylight or anything and i understand why they may not want windows now that they operate next to the ghetto but maybe they could turn up the brightness on the interior lighting or something so you dont think there is a barbecue mafia hit happening in the back corner at pm i did mind the service just a bit while others mentioned the service was speedy i will agree but only after the initial contact it took probably minutes to get someone to acknowledge that we were there this may not be a big deal during a dinner rush on a friday night but in the middle of the afternoon when there are only three tables and there are at least six employees standing behind the counter while only one the eldest by a good margin waited on tables unacceptable after she came by to take our order both food and drinks kept up a good pace however i would suggest ordering the sauce on the side i get that some people may like it but i really didnt like dave s i ordered the beef and pork plate and i also much preferred the pork that pork in fact may be some of the best pork in town but the sauce was so thick and heavy that it killed the taste completely the menu does say that the sauce comes on the meat by default but it needs a more stern warning a little of this stuff goes a long way either it needs to be on the side by default or they need to be a little less heavy with it i did find it interesting that they are old school no sides to speak of and no fries hush puppies and beans dont really count you wont even find macaroni and cheese here but the puppies are pretty good crispy on the outside if a little too chewy on the inside for my preference the beans are indeed tasty if i go back i might go for just some un sauced chopped pork and beans sweet tea report excellent sweet goodness among the best in town and awesomely drinkable the only problem i had was keeping the glass full enough to keep it flowing down my throat when i was i bought a t shirt from the salvation army thrift store from a bbq joint with the words praise the pig pass the napkins emblazoned on the front i still own that shirt and every time i wear it i get a craving for old hickory house the pulled pork is absolutely delicious smokey yet tangy and they certainly give you enough of it i have it on good authority that the ribs and chicken fingers are also tasty though i still dont understand why my coworker ordered chicken fingers at a bbq joint do you like hushpuppies of course you like hushpuppies get them crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside wonderful the cole slaw is sweet and creamy and makes an excellent addition to the pulled pork as it always should oh and there is texas toast mmmm the dining room isnt much to look at i actually find the covered wagon sconces a little creepy and the waitresses will rag on you a little but its all in good fun if you cant lighten up enough to enjoy the experience you probably shouldnt be there in the first place but of course you can enjoy yall are yelpers i went to the old hickory house on a saturday afternoon for lunch i was looking forward to sampling some good bbq i left very disappointed the restaurant was not very busy there were about or booths and one table with a big party of about or people the decor has definitely not changed recently the interior is dark with wooden paneled walls it looked like no one had touched a thing since it opened in which is not a good thing there was some paint peeling from ac duct running across the dining room and some of the chairs were patched with duct tape overall the place looked like it could use a good scrub down this is not a bad thing but for me if a place is like this the food better be very good the waitress let me know i could sit anywhere after i sat down the waitress came over to take my drink order and i also placed my order for lunch i ordered the large beef pork plate which comes with sides for the sides i choose baked beans and hushpuppies i requested to have them put the bbq sauce on the side because i wanted to taste the meat without any sauce i took a while to get my food the waitress came by after about or minutes and appoligized because i sat down after the big table i told her i understood and it wasnt too much longer before my food came out everything looked pretty good the pork beef were both chopped i forgot to tell the waitress i wanted my beef sliced but oh well i tried the pork first it was tender and that was the only good thing about it it was lukewarm and very bland tasting there was no smoke flavor at all i tried adding some of the bbq sauce the sauce was thin with chunks of onions i think in it i thought it would have a vinegary tang but it was sweet and had a citrus or fruit flavor it did not compliment the meat at all the beef was also tender but again it didnt have much flavor and was also lukewarm the beans looked good with a thick sauce which is how i like them like the meat they were very bland the tasted like they had just come out of a can the only redeeming thing about the meal were the hushpuppies the were crispy and hot with an excellent flavor the meal also comes with texas toast one piece was brown on one side burnt on the other the other piece was not toasted at all this kind of sums up what i think is going on at the old hickory house it probably was a great bbq place at one time but now at least for my visit there was no attention to detail of the food coming out of the kitchen the just is no quality control in the kitchen the prices are in line with other bbq places i have eaten at in charlotte and the food was not bad i have to say the service was excellent my waitress did a great job but with all the other choices out there my recommendation is to go somewhere else yelp you have served me well once more i was suffering through one of the longest road trips i have ever endured atl to dc and we had to stop for gas did a quick search for barbecue near me and i found out old hickory was minutes down the road we walk in and are greeted by the cutest bartenderwaitress ever behind her all i could see was open fire and what id describe as meat heaven we ordered a pulled pork sandwich and a barbecue chicken sandwich and all were pleased excellent recommendation for a miserable road trip old hickory house is not very far from my work so i decided to have lunch there one day when i stepped in i was transported back in time the look of the restaurant with its wood panel walls and western sizzlin esque decor was definitely an interesting touch there were fewer than people there so a waitress immediately came and took my drink order while i mulled over the menu i finally decided on the pork and beef plate i requested the pork be chopped and the beef be sliced with bbq beans and hush puppies as the sides apparently you can request the bbq sauce to be on the side but i neglected to do so less than minutes later my food came out the beef was sliced between and thick and the texture of it reminded me more of roast beef than a beef brisket there was no smoke flavor to it whatsoever the taste was okay not really overwhelming or remarkable the pork was finely chopped the bites i managed to take without sauce on it were okay again nothing really remarkable the sauce didnt really do much for me it almost seemed like a sort of tomato ish gravy the beans were bland and there were pieces of pork dispersed within the beans thats all ill say about that the best part of the meal in my opinion was the hush puppies with the exception of one rogue hush puppy that was probably from a much earlier batch the hush puppies were very crispy on the outside and just right on the inside plus they were round unlike the tubular shaped hush puppies im used to seeing here in the carolinas to summarize the service was top notch and the food well not so much a similar review with pictures can be found at http www bigwaynerbbq comreview old hickory house charlotte nc well well this might be my favorite new spot for bbq pulled or chopped pork of course thats what the definition of bbq is in these parts sure the purists say that it should just be pork with a vinegar base sauce with maybe a little tomato i dont know how to properly describe the sauce served here it was tangy thick definitely had tomato and vinegar but it wasnt runny there were shreds of pork in the sauce it was simmered savory goodness if your definition of good bbq is macs pork smothered with their sweet syrup sauce you probably wont like old hickory but if you enjoy the unique bbq you can get from places like bessingers mustard base in north charleston pams buffet in hartsville the original lexington barbecue then make a trip to old hickory house i will report back after i try the ribs oh and about the atmosphere yea the neighborhood is a little sketch but once inside the restaurant i think the ambiance is right on point for a classic carolinas bbq spot i had carryout so i cant say much about the service but honestly i dont care when im eating for under bucks i was lucky enough to be taken here by my buddy johnny l while in town visiting for my job wow all i can say is amazing i felt like i got my total pork bang for my buck i got sweat tea a small pork plate with hush puppies and brunswick stew all was amazing id kill for some more brunswick stew right about now if i had this place near me i would be pounds heavier the bread was scrumptious with the pork and was happily given more when asked the prices are unbelievably cheap my first visit to this place was fantastic i loved the barbecue i wish i were closer so i could pop in more often i usually love the vinegar based bbq but old hickory houses sauce was delicious im now a convert the building did seem a little sketchy but once i was inside and seated the waitress really made me feel welcome she explained how long the place has been around a long time and how everything is cooked and why its so good she was super friendly and talkative i highly recommend this place and hope more people check it out best barbecue in charlotte in my opinion this place kicks ass on all accounts pulled pork ribs hushpuppies brunswick stew you name it eat your heart out macs hate it for ya this is real deal eastern nc style barbecue my favorite despite being raised on sweet kc style sauces and memphis dry rubs the tangy tomato ey vinegar based sauce is right up my alley and ohh nails it hushpuppies are sweet southern style and so crispy and yummy ribs fall off the bone and come unsauced so you can do them up to your liking friendly folks great food local business thats alright with me and for those concerned about the neighborhood it isnt any worse than eating in parts of noda or plaza midwood in my opinion cmon people dont be scurrrred drove all the way here from the other side of town and wow yuck old chicken i dont eat pork so that was not an option my kid liked the pork sandwich but my chicken sandwich was terrible dont think ill be going back so disappointing im still in charlotte on business and decided to go find me some more bbq i looked online for something and while i had plenty of choices however i wanted to say close to where i am staying i found the old hickory house when i got there i was a little suspicious quite honestly the place looks a little sketchy a plain brick building with no windows it looks like it may have at one time been a bar i went in and ordered a small beef and pork plate with a side of brunswick stew and small salad the beef and pork were both very tender juicy and flavorful but the brunswick stew was to die for i thought i had eaten the best in the world i wont mention where because theirs is still good but the bar was definitely raised tonight if i lived here id definitely be a regular i was in charlotte for a business trip and did some reading up on this place i drove for more than minutes to get to this sketchy area hey im from new york i prefer to eat in the sketchy areas it was a horrendous rainstorm only a few cars in the lot but it was relatively early i waited for the rain to die down from torrential to just heavy and saw someone come out with a lot of food and jump into a late model cadillac cts that was encouraging i got inside and there were only a few folks but the waitress was as sweet as could be thanks to yelp i already knew to order the brunswick stew and had to try the hush puppies i settled on the small meat and pork plate shredded well it came out with sauce on it as a texas bbq and durham nc bbq fan i wasnt sure what to expect but i always order my bbq as it is served you can get the sauce on the side but you shouldnt okay the sauce lets talk about it its almost the consistency of a sunday italian ragu no not the crap brand out of a jar the stuff that is made with love taking at least hours in many italian american homes and italian homes around the world starting on sunday morning the sauce is a tomato base but they use vinegar it is the best of both worlds texas meets eastern carolina it melded with the meats both super tender smokey and smoke ringed i had an iced tea unsweetened but added sweet low i then decided to get a small rib platter huge ribs covered in the same sauce with a side of pickles no great need and amazing home made slaw the hush puppies first course were off the hook the brunswick stew perfect and great after the rain yes the interior does not look updated since this location opened in and around since according to the menu and there are crt tube tvs on the bar yes they serve beer there are no windows but let me say this it all adds to the dining experience the prices are very reasonable the menu selections huge and the food you must go here if you want bbq in charlotte can you tell i liked it n b i noticed there were a couple of places in atlanta with the same name and similar menu but they appear unrelated i wonder if one broke off from the rest i think some ppl read the reviews then make reviews based off others meaning whats up with all the reviewers saying sketchy anyway to the point this place it great love the food in the summer time you can smell the hickory wood smoke from down the street talking about free advertising the b stew is to die for well maybe not to die but you get the point im not a chopped pork kinda guy rather have the pulled kind go in and try it sketchness and all youll make it out alive and if you dont well at least you had a great last meal i found this restaraunt on yelp and after reading the rave reviews i couldnt wait to try it everyone had mentioned the sketchy location it didnt seem that bad to me yes the interior is old and dark but ive had some really awesome bbq in similar places we arrived about pm so we were very hungry and wanted to try a little of everything the waitress was very nice and helped us choose how and what to order we ended up with two small rib plates these have ribs each and pound of chopped beef and pound of chopped pork we got beans fries hushpuppies and brunswick stew as the sides and we ordered sweet tea to drink each pork plate came with slices of texas toast our bill totaled before a tip the food was ready very quickly i tried the brunswick stew first it tasted ok but it was barely warmer than room temperature the hushpuppies had lots of positive reviews so i tried one of those it was cold and unremarkable not the crispy outer moist inner deliciousness i had been promised i decided to move on to the meats the meats usually come with sauce already on them but we ordered our sauce on the side ive traveled and lived all over the south from florida to nc to texas and ive never seen bbq sauce like this it was fairly thin like a cross between a tomato base sauce and a vinegar sauce but it was chunky with what seemed to be onions and maybe corn and small meat chunks it looked more like a vegetable soup than bbq sauce there was a distinct citrus flavor that i first thought might be orange juice but was later told it was lemon the sauce was an epic fail for me and there is no other kind of sauce available there the ribs were ok but bland since i hated the sauce and had to eat them dry the chopped beef was dry and bland and not just because it didnt have sauce it was just dried out the chopped pork was definitely the better of the two but still not good enough to even make me want to give this place two stars the sweet tea was good and the texas toast could have been good if it was warm and not room temperature i almost forgot to mention the fries thats because there just wasnt much to say about them other than that there werent many of them my friend and i both felt the same way about this place we find it very hard to believe that so many people love this food and love this sauce i would have paid to have known the truth and skipped eating here next time ill try somewhere else i read the reviews for this restaurant on yelp and decided to gamble because it seemed either people really loved this eatery or hated it after arriving and tasting a bit of the food i found that i joined the ranks of the latter the positives the hush puppies were amazing the negatives the brunswick stew came as a small and tepid paste that had the taste of stale vegetable soup and had the consistency of crushed saltine crackers the bbq pork and beef was dried out and the house sauce over both meats was flavorless and thin the texas toast was alright being the only warm thing served to us on our table this place is the greatest bbq joint ive ever been to last time i came to visit family in the area old hickory house was the first place i went once i got into my rental car i returned here once a day for the entire trip after that and in that time sampled the whole menu the service here is great helpful and with a big smile service great food great got to watch the meat being smoked baked beans are fantastic and you must try the hush pupppies bring your appetite the place is pretty much original from the fifties its dark and rustic i had the ribs fries hushpuppies and texas toast and finished everything but the fries and toast i usually get the rib sauce on the side but this time i did not i think i like it better with the sauce actually on the ribs but it is quite messy that way the iced tea was great and the service was very friendly and on the spot with refills will return where ill never eat bbq again and its not the bbq i have been known to travel for good bbq as do a lot of bbq lovers this place was one of the best i have ever found if you went there for lunch the building was packed so i started to go after the lunch crowd had left so i could take my time and get better service too it is a dreary atmosphere in the dining room with no windows and the lights were always dim i dont remember why i started eating there but it was the best bbq around after a year or two i noticed that the bbq prices had become marginal on being practical so i started ordering a less expensive item the brunswick stew they had the best by far i had ever tasted over the years i would stop in ever few weeks by myself and sometimes with a friend or two and i would have the stew while my party would have the q it was then that i first noticed that the guy at the register the owner would often make mistakes on the amount of the check always to his favor if we caught it he would always apologize and we would pay and leave later i was in with a friend that had never eaten there before and as we finished i suggested we tally the check i pointed out to my friend that the register guy will probably charge too much and we should already know how much we were to pay sure enough he charged too much and i looked at my friend and spoke loudly enough for some of the other patrons to here i told you he would charge too much nothing was said by register guy just an apology he corrected the check took our money and we left i never took anyone there again although not long after that i went and i ordered the stew as usual and as i took my first bite i thought it had a odd flavor i had been eating this stew for years and i knew the taste explicitly and for it to have an odd taste was enough for red flags to go up i called over the waitress and declared that the stew was not good she said no problem and she would get me another bowl taking my bowl away she went through the swinging doors to the kitchen and soon returned with another bowl and set it in front of me and affirmed that the cook had just made it this morning so i took a bite and it had the same odd flavor i cant say for sure but it did remind me of the smell i have experienced while in a restroom then i looked over at the kitchen door and noticed the cook sheepishly peering out at me thats when i had a very strange feeling i wonder if he and the register guy put something in my stew as to get back at me for embarrassing him when i was last in no they wouldnt do that would they maybe if no i cant believe that anyone would do such a thing so i got up and left never to return again im just going to leave it up to you what do you think if you ever go there to eat and the register guy charges you too much maybe you shouldnt say anything if by chance you ever plan on returning you can hardly tell this was a restaurant from the outside but the food was very good i am not a bbq expert but i thought the ribs and chicken was terrific best bbq and brunswick stew in charlotte hands down you know its good bbq when it looks like a road side pit stop the service was great super attentive and my sweet tea always had a refill nearby the beef bbq was tender and juicy the hush puppies were excellent and the coleslaw standard i also tried the brunswich stew which was surprisingly delicious this place is quite delicious i picked up a big platter with a few meats i think i got chopped beef pork chicken and ribs the chicken and ribs were ok not amazing but pretty decent the pulled pork and beef were great with the sauce they gave to us with it the hushpuppies were amazing best we ever had the brunswick stew was also delicious i have never had it before but it was great and super thick and filling you can eat it with a fork overall i would recommend this place there is a reason why this place got stars it is literally as good as carolina bbq gets they serve a mixed platter of meats which is well worth the bucks that they charge the mixed platter is also enough meat for a small army the key to this place is the bbq sauce it is so good that thinking of it makes my mouth water the sauce has this incredible vinegar tang that you cant describe youll just need to try it for yourself pulled pork is literally as good as it gets the wait staff has attitude and is pretty entertaining when im in nc i go to this place over and over again because it is truly a gem after reading reviews of this resturant i wanted to give it a try after trying so many bar b que resturants and not finding a great one yet i decided to give it a try so we and my girlfriend went for early dinner and i have to say it wasnt much to talk about i ordered ribs and beef with sides of hushpuppies and fries the meat had a nice taste to it but the sauce is very different it tasted more like a watered down pizzia sauce i guess the worst part of the meal was the fries and hushpuppies the fries had a weird taste i cant describe and the hushpuppies might of been good but them came out really cold i really wanted to like the food the atmosphere was like i was eating from the movie fried green tomatoes i just hope the meat was from beef and pork all kidding aside i will not go back still on the search for great bar b que preface im not a huge barbeque fan ill eat it and even enjoy it but its not something im regularly hankering for another clt institution thats as old as dirt that ive only recently made it to my office goes out for lunch to celebrate birthdays and this was a recent coworkers pick this is about as authentic as you can get meat of all kinds roasted and chopped right there on my visit at the recommendation of others i had the chopped pork sandwich with a side of brunswick stew both were off the charts lots of flavor especially the stew the meat is dripping in vinegar sauce and the stew is hearty while you wait on your order they give you a basket of hush puppies with butter i could live on these if you like your sweet tea on the sweeter side you wont be disappointed be prepared for sarcasm from your server though theyve all been doing this for quite a long time and have developed a rough around the edges approach chad e gives a very accurate description of the restaurant itself dark wood paneling and very kitschy decor think a s western movie tribute its one big room where everything is dark wood even the walls and covered in wrought iron farm equipment covered wagons and steer horns i would imagine this is how people in china or japan think of texas surprisingly charlotte doesnt have much good bbq to offer if i had to choose one place for wood smoked q it would be this place building is old but food is good best brunswick stew ive tasted after reading many of the reviews for this place i agree with several this place is as good as carolina bbq gets the building is nothing short of scary less than great neighborhood old dingy no windows older than dirt i never would have entered this place had the reviews on here not been so positive theres a big smoker right inside that you can look into the guy operating it will tell you all about the meat too from the time i ordered it took about minutes to get our food as he cut the pork and beef right there after we ordered no steam trays or tubs of warm juice their hush puppies are amazing best ive ever had they also dropped a plate of texas toast onto the table which i would typically ignore as im not a big bread fan my girlfriend ate a piece and commented on how good it was next thing i know i downed two pieces and would have eaten more had we not already finished it how do they make it so good its just toast ive eaten at many good bbq places in charlotte but they were just good this place was excellent great service great food and a positive all around experience definitely worth driving up to the uncc area to visit i finally tried this place for dinner on saturday evening for the life of me i cannot understand why so many rave about it i was thoroughly disappointed all the reviews mention how old the place is so i certainly didnt expect much but i cannot stress enough how bad it really is also the mens restroom looked like it had not been cleaned in a year i arrived at about pm and there were just three tables occupied telling for the dinner hour on a saturday when i left minutes later still just three tables occupied they serve beer but only offer the usual domestic light beers and the like i admit i am a bit of a beer snob so the lack of a decent beer list was a big no no for me and they were out of several of their usual selections to make it worse but all that could have been overcome if the q was top notch i just didnt think it was good at all when you walk in you see a big smoker behind a counter it did not appear to be operating there was no aroma of smoke or bbq at all in the place i had a combo plate with chicken ribs and brisket all were clearly not fresh or even recently made all the meats were very dry tough and served cold and the ribs were the strangest cut i have ever seen must have been some kind of alien pig or something they were awful sides were limited and were not good at all either two bright spots though first the sauce is very good a perfect blend of vinegar and other spices a good thing because you needed to drown the meat in the stuff to make it edible second the service was outstanding bottom line old hickory house is just coasting on their history too many other options for q that are far better to justify returning i will not pretty good barbecue dark s bonanza interior friendly servers expensive i can only speak for the ribs because i am on the low carb thing i get mine with no sauce they are the best ribs i have had in the charlotte area to get ribs this good i was driving an hour away my daughter loves the chicken beans and fries i can not say anything about the sauce because i have not tried it and when i do have sauce i always have it on the side to many opinions on what makes a good sauce and i would not want the sauce to ruin a great rib these ribs need no sauce anyway i love bbq ribs and i am very happy to find ones so good so close if you are in the mood for old school ribs this is the place to be everything is original there everything well minus the tvs which are on the carolina news channel and not blaringly loud everything is quite tasty but the hush puppies are crazy good the sweet tea is sugar coma inducing and one of my favorites in the queen city you do not leave hungry i ate all the ribs on my plate the hush puppies and a half gallon of tea i took home the chicken and fries for another filling meal at a later date its a shame the place is such a drive for me will be back mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm the barbecue is flavorful moist and delicious the texas toast is always to buttery and delicious and the restaurant is cool because if the old fashion look i will be back soon perfect atmosphere nothing fancy tasty bbq very friendly waiter hush puppies n stew review for dont go thought we were in for a treat with the star rating and no negative feedback we ordered pork and ribs very disappointed pork ribs tough and the pork meat was minced beans canned slaw had too much relish nealbwas saved by hush puppies very good bbq ask for bark pieces and consider yourself fortunate if you get them the brunswick stew is the best ive had i thought it was about a star joint its just a different style of bbq that im not used to service was good i was expecting authentic eastern nc barbeque the meat had a decent smoke flavor but the tomato sauce that was thrown on it where they do that at smdh the brisket was a bit tough the ribs where tough on the ends tender in the middle get a new barbecue sauce the sauce is not doing it the price is reasonable a good place for cheap eats brunswick stew was good tried all meats ribs were as chewy as tire rubber could only eat about of the meat the rest was just ok they smother everything in their very soupy tomato vinegar based bbq sauce which tastes more tomato than barbeque chicken was ok nothing special i could taste the smoke a little but mostly just sauce the pork and beef are diced very fine and i could scarcely tell the difference between them the restaurant itself is old and looks like it has never been updated since the s with no windows its dark dingy and also a bit on the dirty looking side especially the bathroom wash your hands before you go i would look for a better bbq charlotte i have to agree with jeffrey c here great service old school barbecue atmosphere but really really lousy barbecue low and slow is the way to go boys chicken tasted like petrified wood barbecue is only as good as the cuts of meat start with their cuts seem to be on the cheap and tough side even ribs that shouldve fallen off the bone were tough and harsh barbecue sauce way too heavy and vinegar and not enough heat presentation is a big cafeteria zero the brunswick stew was chopped up mishmash that looked really disgusting although it tasted reasonably decent hush puppies were the only thing that lived up to advertising local yelpers let me down here or yall just havent had much good barbecue tickets one star for service and one star for atmosphere if they could find someone who can cook in that great smoker then it might be a really cool hip place awesome nc bbq the service is always good the people are friendly the place has been around forever and it has not changed in the yrs ive frequented it good bbq nothing short of that ive found none better in charlotte as a texan in nc i came here to try some of their bbq i ordered their pork sandwich with slaw and it was pretty good no complaints there their coleslaw was a little too sweet for my taste but still very good also definitely try their brunswick stew and hush puppies the service was also prompt and they were friendly the only complaint my party had was that they wish there was more meat for the price other than that we would come back again if in charlotte ate their brisket last night it wasnt good at all restaurant was pretty dead im surprised the rating is so high came from vegas and really enjoyed the bbq the tomato vinegar based sauce was something different but me and my son loved it hush puppies were awesome and rubs were nice and meaty i love supporting businesses like this and appreciate the non corporate uniqueness about this place sweet tea was great too no other bbq comes close this place has been a family tradition for forever and ive never had anything better i always get the large bbq pork plate with coleslaw and hushpuppies or beans and a bowl of brunswick stew to share with my sister everything is simply perfection especially the buttery toast that comes free with your meal i love how nothing has changed from food down to the decor i hope it never does over years later and their brunswick stew is still the best ive ever had their brisket is better than i remembered and i had the exact meal as before but without the ribs finally i grabbed a slice of pecan pie ala mode not homemade but very good all in all id add another star if i could for the consistency prob was good back in the day inside looks it did years ago if i had to guess food was okay mostly reheated it tasted good but did not want make me want to come back sweet tea was spot on waitress was friendly they do not clear your table of any plates until you leave so dont plan on staying and visiting at your table amazingly friendly service classic american bbq and priced to kill no doubt a standard go to for good bbq in the area what appears to be a classic barbecue joint that might have been here for decades old hickory house is feeling its age but hey so what the second clue that it was going to be good was when we noticed that there was no extra sauce on the table these folks mean it i said to my dining companion we ordered a couple of barbecue platters it is was more than decent finely chopped pork and beef topped with a sauce that was both tomato based and still had a good vinegar kick i had mine with beans and brunswick stew a basket with four slices of excellent texas toast was also delivered a very different brunswick stew from one ive ever had before while its probably an old family recipe it was mush like an oatmeal texture and had quite a lot of corn in it strange good grilled cheese for the kids and hush puppies good pork sandwich but not so crazy about the bbq sauce weve had this venerable began operation in bbq joint on our nc barbecue bucket list for more than a few years now last tuesday we paid them a visit and it was much less than wed hoped for much less in almost every respect there is little here that represents the more traditional nc barbecue restaurant which doesnt mean it has to be bad but here it did mean that the building is beyond well worn the parking area seems a work in progress hard to tell where the roadside ends and the parking begins the inside is dark almost brooding and not a great deal of light spreads out from the small faux oil lamp fixtures we were seated promptly in the almost empty dining area drink orders secured and our food choices followed quickly we went with bbq chicken dark meat with brunswick stew and baked beans and a small bbq pork plate with ffs slaw also the meals did not come with hps but rather with thick slices of texas toast the first of a number of things not traditional in nc bbq restaurants you can buy an order of hps for if youd like we didnt the food was out of the kitchen rather quickly and that was perhaps the highlight of the ensuing meal the bbq chicken was simply awful it was overcooked dry tasteless sans the sauce the skin tough and leathery the whole mess smothered in a thick sweet red barbecue sauce that quickly became cloying the brunswick stew was pretty good though very different in texture and content from that normally served in this area the stew here is thicker and contains no lima beans and according to unc tv food guru bob garner it probably contains stale bread which thickens the end product the baked beans also were nice with some pieces of meat in it the pork is minced much like stameys in greensboro but the pork here is not cooked over hard wood coals so there is no smokiness to it at all the sauce is a thick red sauce rarely found in this area usually found farther west i like this style sauce on occasion but not this sauce and not on this meat the service was very good until it came time to pay the check we waited over minutes at the register while several employees milled around apparently not authorized to operate the register finally an unpleasant and rude man the owner or manager i guess came out of the back took my money without a im sorry or a thank you well ive a thought on the thanks part no thanks for this food this restaurant and this arse at the register this restaurant is a charlotte must try it is like a time capsule with the decor and open pit smoker in plain view traditional southern bbq with all the sides the servers were friendly and the bbq was great love this place did take out for the first time here yesterday food was great and hot going back today to try the brunswick stew everyone keeps talking about havent had bbq this good anywhere else in charlotte i had the pulled pork teriyake and canjun wings the teriyake wings were alittle too sweet but the cajun wings were perfect i recommend you try this place prices are alittle high but what do you expect its bbq not what i expected the brisket hash was flavor less without the sauce like wise was the ribs the ribs were fall off the bone tender but tasted like it was cooked without even the most basic salt and pepper seasoning it also had not a single hint of smoke flavor to it the sauce although different was very good and salvaged the entire meal the decor is like stepping into a diner from the late s but it works and i kinda like the feel of this place the visible opened faced smoker is a great touch and adds to the overall laid back atmosphere this place is closing in a few days and i see why i went for the first time today and was extremely disappointed it took almost minutes for a waitress to come over and once she took the order she never came back i got the large chopped pork barbecue plate along with brunswick stew and fries the barbecue was mediocre at best a bit too chopped for my taste and almost mushy the flavor was ok but nothing to write home about the brunswick stew was proof once again that no one in north carolina knows how to make brunswick stew its almost got an oatmeal texture thats really just not nice the fries were standard steak fries they werent cold but they werent piping hot either lunch also came with two sad mushy pieces of texas toast all in all i feel ripped off no way was this worth including soda and generous tip for all the great service if you want a similar dining experience folksy family friendly barbecue in a quasi s setting but with much better food and service try hillbillys in lowell as it stands the best thing i can say about old hickory house is that it didnt make me sick i just heard old hickory house is closing i am so sad have been going there since it is the best barbecue i have ever had used to go every friday night with my boyfriend now husband we still go by when were back in charlotte service is always fast the food is consistent delicious my husband loves the brunswick stew i love the baked beans with pieces of barbeque mixed in i just hope the carter family will open again we will follow them wherever they relocate hate to see them go being a native charlottean ive enjoy this place since they were off freedom dive many many eons ago and moved to the current location back in the seventies this was our friday night ritual and i remember many times having to wait in line for a table anyone that knocks this type of bbq obviously isnt from the south the days of building open fire pit bbq restaurants like this one are far and away and the only reason this one is still open is because its grandfathered into the fire codes and this type of fire pitting is very labor intensive and hard work because they use real hickory fire wood not those nasty little pellets some other so called southern style bbq restaurants use i too had to wait yesterday and they were out of brunswick stew but they were also nice enough to hold a gal for me on request and i picked it up today i also took home a whole smoked chicken which weighted almost three pounds and was excellent thank you to the person below that didnt like the stew ill willingly take your share home and yes it absolutely is proof that people in n c know how to make brunswick stew the carters do dont like it make your own and put your tofu in it and yes its thickened with bread the way it was done over a hundred years ago just be glad they dont put squirrel and rabbit in it the way its suppose to be done thats the way us poor ol southern folks make it so i have a restaurant recommendation for you folks that didnt like the old hickory house sonnys is your huckleberry ive been to this place a few times now when i saw i was traveling to charlotte i quickly remembered to visit this place again the bar b que is phenomenal here the only disappointment today was that they were out of the brunswick stew but the beans and hush puppies are awesome too just not as awesome as the stew goodbye old hickory house going to miss yo}

{11346, Gooski's, 3117 Brereton St Polish Hill Pittsburgh PA 15219, by far the best bar in pittsburgh quite possibly the best bar ever incredibly strong cheap drinks great friends great music and the best pool tournaments ever i pretty much dont even remember the first time i ever went to gooskis i dont even know what bars i went to before i started coming here hmmmm the first great thing about this place is location it was about minutes drive from my old apartment i think i got lost going to this place probably the first times i went its located in the heart of polish hill but i really dont think any polish people ever went there im pretty sure this place served food because i think i was even friends with some of the cooks there but i honestly dont remember ever eating anything there besides the free pretzel rods i dont think they even have lime or lemon wedges to garnish cocktails probably the best about this bar was its locals i dont remember anybodys name except this dude named bob he is always in the back room playing pool with a tall can of busch in his hand i think hes retired but im not exactly sure from what occupation but he always had super funny things to say and he always had these skinny little joints hed smoke with us at the bus stop a couple of doors down nice guy somehow i even have a gooskis t shirt which i still proudly wear from time to time in sunny san diego everyone is always like wtf does your shirt mean and i dont even bother to explain because theyll never understand the greatness of gooskis unless they attend in person to experience the unbelievably smoky ambience and all the hand written decor in the bathrooms the best dive bar in pittsburgh this is the kind of place you would expect to find in nyc not next to an old polish church no pretensions and no attitude just a great reasonably priced selection of beers micro and imported great specials on wedthur with imports and micros forget which on which night great juke box friendly bartenders pool and table tennis also has live music including such great acts as the slavic soul party and balkan beat box no frills no crap good ol honest bar i love the ping pong and pool table bartender with the beard and baseball cap is cool great beer selection good prices nice people hang out here good fries amazing juke box gooskis is my favorite dive bar in pittsburgh though i tend not to go there when its snowy or icy since it requires negotiating very steep hills they do have a surprisingly good beer selection and the bartenders are nice if you ask they will give you candy if they have it they do have perogies that are decent but pretty expensive for perogies you can get a pizza delivered there if the kitchen is closed it is pretty smokey which is typical for pittsburgh despite their attempts to pass no smoking laws fridays is a good night if you want to see live musicthere is a cover sometimes the music is good and sometimes its a strange hair metal band which is also pretty awesome in its own way oh gooskis your music is loud your beer is cheap your pool tables are bountiful and your bathrooms are disgusting you are everything i could possibly want in a dive bar when i return to my homeland at x mas time i will be paying you a visit my love without question my favorite pittsburgh dive bar good jukebox decent beer selection and the cheapest prices on good beer ive yet found in pittsburgh plus it has a canonical dive bar atmosphere that warms my cockles i havent tried the food though it has been repeatedly recommended to me my only complaint is the relative inaccessibility of polish hill the greatest bar of all time this bar is basically one of the most exciting and fulfilling establishments available in the steeler nation i know people who have spent most of their adult lives in this bar i know people with tattoos based on the logo of this bar i know people that wont go anywhere but gooskis who mean gooskis when they say the bar i know of relationships and marriages that have started and ended at this bar i have seen hearts sing and get broken in this filthy smoky bar i hesitate to even tell you how great it is because i dont want to mess it up great bands shows with sweaty crowded dancing friends and strangers excellent jukebox amazing drinks quality beer at ice cold temperatures poured out of cleanish taps delicious bar food prices frozen in and a diverse and interesting cast of characters seated at the bar working behind it watch out though one time a trashed drunk dude grabbed my ass and when i confronted him his girlfriend got mad at me and tried to fight me this is the sort of bar where neighbors bring over christmas lights to decorate for the holidays theres a bunch of dirty punks hanging around here a crowd of meatheads some normal working people some of pittsburghs elite intelligentsia and so on generally you dont find a lot of students or short timers at this bar this is for those who bleed black gold with roots in the allegheny and the mon or at least people who can adopt a reasonable yinzer accent attitude without irony plus there is some m fing pinball ok this is more than a bar really its not fair to call it that its a legend and an institution i have such a fine time here whenever visiting good ol pittsburgh the bestfunniest was back in when visiting friend todd and meeting his roomate said roomate got so sozzled he actually pooped himself then passed out when he awoke covered in crap he simply wanted to know why anybody would put all that poop all over him yeah good times oh gooskis how i love you i am married to the park house but i would cheat on it with you more often if only you werent in polish hill i love your rank smoky dive bar stench your incredibly strong mixed drinks at garage sale prices your penchant for punk rock you might be the best dive bar in the history of the universe hipster central but theyve got a good beer selection nice ambiance and that perfect dive bar noise level in the front room with a band in the back its loud but not so loud that you cant have a conversation just right previous posters have done a lot to explain why this place rocks however in spite of its crucialness i found myself going there less and less often and i say this knowing that it sounds totally weak because i couldnt deal with the smoke i know i am not the only one sure its a dive bar but we all know that it was pretty next level here but this has all changed with the implementation of a new ventilation system that actually led to my going home on friday night wondering whether they had banned smoking there because i hadnt noticed any smoke they did not ban smoking all hail gooskis yeah its that good dont trust me go i wish i lived inside this place maybe theyll hire me as a part time bar back and pay me in cheap delicious beer and crackling spicy wings god if only didnt have rent and a hugely materialistic bent i recently moved to nyc and have found nothing that compares to the greatness that is gooskis dark and smokey with cheap drinks an awesome jukebox and a ever revolving cast of interesting characters gooskis is the best dive in the burgh try the kielbasa n kraut sandwich and red shots made exclusively by tim the bartender just dont ask whats in them i love this place started hanging out there on what would become the first date with my now wife introduced to the place by a fellow musician the place has a great vibe for all types of people its dark not pretentious they have a great cheap selection of beers killer tunes on the jukebox and the most amazing honey bbq wings ever i love this bar i wish that i could put it in my pocket and take it back to los angeles with me gooskis has hands down the best jukebox that i have ever had the pleasure of bullying side note jukebox bullying is when you put in a crap ton of money in to guarantee listening to your own tunes while drinking this can annoy other bar patrons but you can be assured that you will be listening to good music back the review i bullied with talking heads elo pixies beck mgmt bo diddly ray charles the clash and much much more maybe no one else wanted to hear road to nowhere but i had a fantastic time on top of the eclectic jukebox the drinks are incredibly cheap jameson and gingers for bucks sold i hear the beer selection is great as well which i am not surprised in a city like pittsburgh i will be making many repeat appearances in the next couple of months i love you gooskis shrugs blinks and an i dont know we went based on yelp reviews i thought this place was going to blow me away this might be the coolest bar in pittsburgh im not sure ive only been to a few i love gooskis i love it so hard sadly its been about three years since ive paid a visit unwisely moved out of the state but as soon as this blizzard clears up and i can get on a bus i plan to remedy that best jukebox in town great beers for cheap awesome bartenders and a giant oriental carpet that has f you chalked onto it back by the pool tables what more could you want they used to have the best wings ive ever eaten anywhere and that particularly includes at the anchor bar in buffalo those sucked but i see below that someone said theyve stopped serving food so they can still allow smoking can this be true i might cry or at the least have a moment of silence for the old bay wings many are the nights when a straub and a basket of those wings served as dinner after a too long shift at work followed by a too long bus ride and walk up the hill at least the last time i was there it was cash only but they have a convenient atm located near the bar the bathroom graffiti is legendary i really enjoy this place its always a good time with a great juke box and surprisingly skilled bartenders for what most would consider a dive bar if you like bloody marys id recommend them this is an excellent place to meet up with people to chat and its usually pretty low key i think all neighborhood bar owners should have to visit here to see what they should be doing the crowd is usually so varied that people watching is excellent and its never so loud that you need to shout it can get incredibly smoky towards the end of the night almost uncomfortably so but it suits the atmosphere take an awesome dive bar with cheap drinks dim lighting incredible jukebox great staff and good location and youve got gooskis the best of the best everyone loves this bar people from out of the city want to go there because theyve heard about it they have a great menu the food is awesome and did i mention the jukebox is sublime oh and on sundays bloody mary specials who could ask for more gooskis is the best bar in pittsburgh for several reasons best jukebox in pittsburgh cheap drinks with a wide selection of beers and liquor awesome staff people who are friendly love their job and do it well the crowd is usually a mix of fun nice and interesting people cent pool table free ping pong great wings the cajun wings are fantastic they have hdtvs for sports a backroom that doubles as venue for shows this dive bar on polish hill is known for its cheap beer and live music its also in my opinion known for rude patrons extremely loud noise levels and rooms so crowded you cant walk even when no band is playing other reviewers definitely seem to find this incredible crowding appealing but i guess i prefer to have room to sit stand and move around ill not be visiting gooskis again gooskis is a great bar one of my favorites and the best for what it is a small dark smokey bar lit with red lights and filled with people who are chilling and doing their own thing on weeknights it can be quiet conversations but it can get loud if someone turns on the jukebox theres also a backroom thats well lit and has more space and pool tables and pingpong on weekends bands play back there and the place is packed finally if youre a beer lover then theres a lot of microbrews for very cheap prices ie dfh min ipa pints for i highly recommend this bar check it out on monday or tuesday when its not packed to see if you dig it suitable for anyone who enjoys avoiding sunlight red light bulbs black walls cheap drinks great posters jukebox and possibly viking or norse bartender if i lived in pittsburgh i would be a regular this place is great and also is the only place ive ever seen the inside of a toilet tagged perfect for drinking whiskey and beer gooskis yay love you marcus and timmy all the hype left me wanting a little more from this place but you cant deny its classic dive appeal ample space cheap drinks and fast service is about all you can ask for in a dive the fact is you know what youre getting with this place and the quasi isolated location keeps those who arent into the scene out of your face good its cheap loud every now and then a good band will play good drink selection bad the parking and the crowd its fun to watch the young kids marvel in this new bar theyve just discovered and is totally the coolest place like ever funny stuff went there with a friend the bar is pretty cool and the drinks were cheap but nothing special that stands out about this place the beer selection is vast the prices are low and the bartender understands polish pronunciation as charlie sheen would say this place is tri winning also saturdays live band while not really all that great fit in pretty perfectly in the back room of this place the only negative call me high maintenance but ill never be a fan of smoking in bars which means minus one star months into the pittsburgh chapter of my life and i finally made my way over i kind of feel like ive wasted at least days of those months by not going to gooskis on a regular basis i look forward to returning on a non live show night to see what this place is like with the back room offering the full array of bar room funtivities perhaps they will make me forget the smoke and offer up a full fledged five stars can i admit something im really not a dive bar person i know i know it doesnt make sense im cheap i love cheap drinks and this is the mecca of cheap drink places i like to mix and mingle at bars i like to drop it like its hot if i dropped it like its hot here i may get slapped i know this place is like thee dive bar spot in the burgh but i was just meh i think the fact that smoking is still allowed makes a huge difference for me i go home smelling like an ash tray and yearning for a dance party the only draw for me is the wide selection of beers and the dirt cheap prices i just lean over the counter and stare at the huge beer refrigerator scan my eyes over the bottles until the holy beer spirit hits me and i go that one its almost like my own personal beer tasting will i go back probably will i like it with enough drinks yes as you approach gooskis for the first time surrounded by nothing else commercial at all youre probably thinking wow this place is nestled deep in the neighborhood as you walk in the good time vibe greets you as does an utterly solid beer selection including plenty of interesting picks from good cans to upscale bottles it can be a little hard to see the selections available on the mirror menu so take your time deciding just approach the bar with your order after youve chosen saw a live show in the back here recently and dug the acoustics both in the back room and flowing into the pass through to the bar the jukebox selections were dyn o mite too be prepared for indoor smoking which almost feels like a throwback now the crowd can be hit or miss but more likely to be an agreeable mix and if youre able to get a seat theyre comfortable really if you make your way to brereton youre going to be rewarded with a good time and an enjoyable drink ps if you drove over just remember to disengage the parking brake at the end of the night before moseying home i went here alone when i first moved to pittsburgh maybe it wouldve been a better experience had i not been alone but i go out alone a lot and ive never felt as awkward as i did when i walked into gooskis everyone turned to look at me as i came in the door and their eyes followed me until i took a seat in a booth by myself do i have something on my face i grabbed a beer sat and drank it and decided to leave rather than stay it didnt feel very friendly to me but maybe ill give it a second chance based on some of these other reviews gooskis is one of my favorite bars in pittsburgh why oh why would i enjoy such a small punk dive as gooskis you ask for one service is amazing beer selection fantastic shows there are great they have the best jukebox in the city maybe even in the state and their prices are decent only setback smokings still allowed here so i wind up having to shower immediately after every visit not that i dont shower already after a sweaty night at a bar but you know what i mean for a very amateur beer connoisseur their fridge sends me to heaven and back they have a full supply of pretty much all the unibroue beers delirium lambics and a whole slew of other imported beers ive never even heard of more importantly though their usual weeknight bartender is amazing to be honest he looks to be an intimidating character but in reality hes super nice patient mad efficient and helpful in selecting my next brew of choice a for service definitely check out gooskis if you dont mind a bit of smoke and some polish hill punks can you get more of a dive bar than gooskis admittedly ive only done some day drinking here on a few occasions so i cant comment on the night crowd but its a good place to relax and have a few beers if youre passing through polish hill they have a good selection of beers on tap with some quality brews and their prices are lower than average for most if you enter during the day you have to wait a few minutes for your eyes to adjust gooskis keeps it dark inside the first time i entered i wasnt sure they were open but give it minutes and you get used to it theres also a pool table in the back room and ive even seen the room used to show some very odd movie scenes which tells you they like to mix it up there too gooskis wont dress up for you but its the right place for good beer and some good people if youre in polish hill probably my favorite pgh bar started going here years ago and it was an instant attraction i leave reality outside the door its a total escape great beer selection never ate food other than potato chips fireplace working in the back room in the winter pool tables great juke box selection its your fantasy rock n roll basement downside they need a smoke eater when i leave there get home and strip down and hang my clothes outside go straight to the shower the smoke is out of control exploring pittsburgh and found this neighborhood bar it had just opened on a saturday afternoon so there was not much going on the bartender was prepping the bar so he was not as friendly but i was able to make some notes for my friends in other areas this bar reminded me of a mt adams cincy short north columbus the place had great craft beers what place in pittsburgh does not they had a chalkboard with all the beer listings and food listings i will go back one evening and hope to provide more of a review on the night life and food i am sure this place rocks thought it was nothing special was the definition of a dive bar smoky dimly lit and crowded for a dive bar i thought the beers were a little expensive overall i dont think i would go back unless convinced by friends to give it another shot terrible bar dont go here the jukebox has a bunch of music that isnt on the radio the bands that play here arent even popular enough to play the regatta or a rib cook off i would never dream of pooping in the bathroom one of my favorite bars in the country kick ass jukebox and tim slings drinks with the best of em food is good and the bands ive seen play have all been pretty sweet they also have a great beer selection and carry great lakes from cleveland hell yeah i wish there were more bars like this awesome dive bar in polish hill tim is an awesome nordic ice warrior prince who slays the bar food is above par for bar food they have great weekly specials and its a nice place to see a show the atmosphere like most dive bars depends on how packed it is you can go have a quite drink and smoke with a few friends at a booth or be packed and wait a few for a drinks love this place my memories of time spent drinking at gooskis are glowing red thatd be due to the string of red christmas lights that line the wall of liquor behind the bar turning your drinking neighbors faces that festive slash nightmarish hue like hot stuff the little devil gooskis is my favorite bar in pittsburgh and one of my favorite bars anywhere anywhere anywhere this neighborhood bar on polish hill is divey and comfortable dark and smoky and punkish all over the bartenders were cool friendly nuff and yet you could tell that they take no malarkey drinks are strong and well priced plus there are a good range of beers available from polish to good crafts and all kinds in between including some nostalgic hey my old man used to drink st pauli girl varieties and lowenbrau pops favorites by the way about the smoking thing the sweet freedom of smoking inside i actually dont even smoke anymore and i wasnt even an inside smoker when i did but for some reason i find it important for people who want to smoke to have a place roam free everyones mentioned the jukebox and i will too i geek for such things as great jukeboxes gooskis collection of albums is completely excellent fun and basically perfect ill admit seeing the pogues up in there is an appreciation adder id say that its remarkable i was able to remark very good oh i didnt even mention that they seem to have really gooddangerous daily drink specials i forget exactly what the deally was but on a tuesday night there was some kinda boozy bargain that made us look at each other right in the eye and vow sternly no no or wed stay all night thats a testament to legitimacy of this bar as well as to our own particular brand of ism we roadtripped to gooskis to see our friends band a few month ago we had never been to pittsburgh before and im still dreaming about the wings they were awesome while the place is smoke filled i enjoy the atmosphere its not pretentious and i dont feel like i have to be remotely concerned with what i look like here mostly because its also rather dark it has a nice section in the back to play pool and just to relax however its not the most appealing bar that i have seen or would like to frequent it is however nice enough cheap drinks and cheap atmosphere one of my all time favorite dive bars these are the types of places that make me so happy i moved back to pittsburgh great beer and spirit selection including decent scotches for cheap with awesome specials and the food goes far beyond decent bar food it holds its own ignoring the drinks ive been thinking about those mozzarella sticks for the past few weeks since i went to gooskis last also the bartender is awesome and resembles a viking god win win win my man and i have decided that gooskis has the best wings ever that is all i live in austin texas and was visiting pittsburgh last weekend happened to come across gooskis fantastic dive bar cold cheap beer very friendly accommodating staff and the best jukebox east of the mississippi gooskis is my go to bar in pittsburgh best wings in town great bands there on the weekend sound could be better though needs to upgrade sound system as technical difficulties are often the pixies and other cool music on the jukebox decently priced drinks and the very attentive bartender tim q the female bartender is not good though april at any rate very cozy and its like walking into your own den another improvement could be the lighting some people like sitting in the super dark i do not parking can be rough but ride your bike or somethin its the spot regulars and newcomers blend cheap drinks rich laughs and a whole lot in between theyve got cheap pool and free ping pong plus theyre sporting an xmen pinball machine ive got more stories starting with gooskis than i care to count awesome place and its all thanks to the staff all hail timmy best wings ive ever had and awesome beer selection want to go to a dive bar in pittsburgh gooskis is the place for you this quickly became my go to place after the first time i visited i was going to a live show in polish hill with a cover and gooskis was the closest place with an atm i walked into the bar and it was so dark i couldnt even find the atm and when i finally got there i couldnt find where to slip my card in ironically i love the feel of this place its a dark neighborhood dive bar cheap drinks with cool bartenders cool polish hill residents with no hangups about superficiality the bar is also equipped with a good juke box ping pong and pool tables and a stage in the back for pretty good live music its pretty smokey inside so beware if thats not your thing the food is actually pretty good too overall i love this place and am usually there about once a week best dive bar in pittsburgh good food good beer its my favorite rarely does a dive bar deserves such high honors but i wish i could give more first off as asian gals we stuck out like two crazy swollen thumbs it was a tuesday night and there were live bands performing theres a cover charge but when the doorman asked if we were here to see the bands and we honestly said it was out first time he simply smiled and said go ahead we found seats at the bar and was greeted by a bartender with the longest goatee i have ever seen having ventured into brooklyn new york plenty of times i have seen a lot of goatees we made friends friends quickly with the fellow patrons who werent shy to point out the house rules which were basically along the lines of have your order ready money ready dont make us kill you i wont lie it was a bit intimidating but after a couple of beers we were good it was a lively crowd and was packed bathrooms were immaculate and jukeboxpool table ping pong table live bands were on point i cant say it was my type of music but it worked parking was a bit scary bc it was was on steep hills hence polish hills but wow the pierogis were fcuking amazing yes i will try to use profanity bc they were that amazing i almost didnt want to write a review bc not only does the bar rules included something along the lines of if you needed yelp to come here you dont belong here but this place is an amazing diamond in the jewelry store it stands out the brightest amongst all diamonds will def have to come back p s shoutout to tim for being the best bartender in pittsburgh i can see why he was voted best dive bar in pittsburgh interesting crowd tons of beer choices large menu and the fries were good then again most everything tastes good when theres oz of arrogant bastard ale in your belly great prices fucking awesome wings thy sell anchor steam beer so that makes me super happy great bar great beer great food this place was recommended on my visit to pittsburgh not disappointed dark divey great beer selection and the type of relaxed grungy hipsters who dont try too hard or act like assholes wings were served in a basket of fucking oil and were greasy as fuck all but i wasnt expecting haute cuisine in a dive great place to chill chain smoke and try and get laid this place is great but i hear that they sacrifice you to rob halford if youre a yuppiebro better not chance it gooskis is the shit just read the rest of the reviews its just the type of place you wanna be if you like bars with a little bit of edge go to gooskis sling some drinks listen to tunes smoke if you wanna make memories this place has a lot of character from the bar itself the patrons and not to mention the decorative graffiti on the bathroom walls awesome for shows pool or just to hang out and drink beers defiantly one of my favorite spots in pittsburgh this place is a gem prices are extremely reasonable for drinks and shots one thing to be aware of this place is cash only and smoking is allowed this doesnt bother me but could defiantly bother some people overall this place is awesome for a hang out and you wont break the bank doing so either perfect dive bar cheap drinks cheap food great variety in both good live music friendly bartender smoking is allowed so its like its with the ash tray smell leaving the place go swirly for what it is you really couldnt ask for more i was very happy with their service staff provide better service for me highly recommend to all of my friends bartender was an ahole dont was your time going there coolest bar in iron city tim is a hell of a bartender and a stand up guy highly recommended if youre not a square a super cool bar with really nice bartenders and on top of that they have ping pong tables which was awesome for me because i get bored at bars easily but still want to have fun i would go back here in a heartbeat i have mixed feelings about gooskis overall i do enjoy my time there but they staff and regulars seem to pride themselves on being exclusive and pretentious about not wanting tons of people from outside the neighborhood coming in they have something along the lines of if you needed yelp to find us you dont belong here on the mirror behind the bar which takes away some of my excitement for the place im not into that attitude all you are a bar people like bars be happy you are making money i live in polish hill so i do hang here occasionally but that is my least favorite aspect for example i recently ordered a moscow mule the bartender first told me they didnt have the copper mugs i said it was fine to have it in a regular glass he said they dont really do those kinds of drinks there come on dude its not like i ordered a flaming rum punch im pretty sure you have vodka ginger beer and lime juice but ok they previously had the honor of having the best bartender in the city tim as recognized by city paper pittsburgh magazine and others but i dont see him around too much if he is there your service will be spot on if not its kind of hit or miss it is quite a bit pricier than drinking at the other neighborhood bar the rock room but has an equal divey grimy charm it is also very dark like almost weirdly dark in the front room it is much brighter in the back room where you can pay pinball pool or ping pong unless there is a show people also rave about the jukebox which is actually one of the old school machines with mix cds rather than the usual digital ones you see in most bars now the food is ok ive had chicken sandwiches and burgers here that were pretty good for typical bar food the best time to go is during happy hour or definitely thursday nights when they have a special on all of their craft beer this place has a sign indicating their disdain for yelp which only makes me want to hop on and write them a nice review about my pleasant experience here gooskis is a divey punk bar somewhat in the likes of nycs lower east side east village its dark and grungy and smells appropriately like cheap beer on the other hand their restroom is rather clean for this type of establishment and smelled nothing of poorly aimed urine when i was there and for a smoking bar they seem to have a first rate ventilation system to suck away the cigarette clouds cheers to oz cans of a variety of beers including better ones like heineken for or less and cheers to the bartender who gave me a free t shirt i love gooskis i always felt like i would since several people i know and trust have suggested it to me but one thing or another kept getting in the way of me actually trying it out on friday after a disastrous foray into a newer establishment that hasnt quite found its feet yet my friend and i decided to hit up this place instead we walked in and were greeted by reddish lighting that provided just the right amount of illumination and music that was loud but not so much that it inhibited conversation the atmosphere was decidedly no nonsense and very chill its the sort of place where youre left alone to socialize and drink imagine that as a young woman its refreshing to say the least at the risk of sounding like goldilocks gooskis is just right the selection prices and service are all on par with what you would expect from a high quality pittsburgh dive they even have some more rare beers one of which i immediately ordered the bartender was rough on the surface but warmed up after i sassed him and ended up giving us free snacks i love it when bartenders take care of you but then hang back without trying too hard nothing worse than when a bartender tries to be your best friend andor insists you try beers you dont like the bartender was pretty much the best part of the evening i will be back soon ive been going to gooskis for two decades or more old school punk rock shows stiff drinks without stiff pricing a place i can walk into and know at least ten people at any given time cheers to gooskis the very best dive bar in pittsburgh this is actually the type of position youd anticipate to see in nyc not next to an old polish church no pretensions and no perspective only a great moderately priced collection of beers micro and imported excellent specials on wedthur with imports and micros forget which on which nighttime excellent juke box friendly bartenders pool and table tennis also has live music including such great acts as the slavic soul party and balkan beat box}

{32638, Off Broadway, 2408 South Blvd South End Charlotte NC 28203, the best store i have found for shoe shopping close to downtown charlotte you could drive further to a dsw but the selection here is just as good and service is arguably friendlier huge selection theyve got a large section of sale shoes and they also have pocketbooks think rows and rows of shoes for you to browse set up like dsw they even have a decent mens shoes section the prices were great and they carry all of the top designers what more could you ask for off broadway has a huge selection of shoes ive gotten some cute cheap ballet flats and sandals here if you go its worth it to comb through the clearance racks you might find a really great deal they also offer pretty good rewards and coupons off broadways location nearby uptown and just past dilworth is also a nice perk discount shoe warehouse within minutes of home yeah im a fan place is huge and has everything you could need for both men and women casual and dress shoes and a clearance section went there recently to buy tennis shoes specific for tennis and they ad a very limited selection a little disappointing but considered that they probably dont sell a lot having little in inventory was expected you also receive bonus bucks on your next visit for a little extra discount for the next time frequent visitor plus macs is across the street to it make for a nice afternoon ha this place specifically this location is the best shoe place in town besides my ever favorite nordstroms being a size shoe is tough for a girl but this place has the largest selection of bigger sizes in the city even better is the size of their clearance racks always a great assortment of fashion loafers dress and work shoes im never left without options since its in a centrally located spot in relation to uptown their high end selection is great and i always have the best luck on the higher priced brands cole haan kenneth cole etc being on clearance too the staff always greets you upon entering and the instant rewards you get for shopping there really add up do yourself a favor and just drop in once id be shocked if you dont walk out with a new pair at a great price and make it your favorite shoe store too huge warehouse type store with loads of selection and price points for just about any budget the downside designer labels are rare to find and sometimes non existent if you like paying big bucks for brand names this is not your place go be waited on in a department store if you like shoes that get the job done and dont always cost a lot then off broadway is worth a visit store is divided between mens and womens shoes with women getting about a generous of the retail floor boots heels flats you name it just about every kind of shoe i could think of is there but you likely wont always recognize the name on the label for the guys dress shoes casual wear sneakers and a few flip flops make it into the mix yes theres a handful of nike adidas reebok etc there but youll not find a full and complete line same for dress shoes kenneth cole calvin klein etc nothing super high end looks like this store either picks and chooses to cover the necessities or it only buys on special deals on a very limited selection you can absolutely get running shoes here but it just may not be the exact model you were looking for same with dress shoes but as a guy who does have to dress in a suit daily i am impressed that i can still find higher end dress shoes no rubber soles and full leather uppers but for both sexes the deal you have got to check out is the clearance section in the very back a small selection of shoes grouped by size is put on the rack with colored stickers that correspond to how much additional you get to take off the price by far this is the deal ive bought dress shoes for less than ive bought casual shoes that originally were for about the selection changes constantly as they sell out and lines are discontinued but i have had very good luck finding something close to what i was looking for every single time now for those who are local the second best deal is the encore rewards you get at the register you basically get a coupon for of your total purchase to use towards a future purchase and you can stack those coupons together hence if you shop for shoes enough you could likely score a free pair or two after several trips the coupons never expire you just have to keep the entire receipt together you cant beat a deal like that in all this is just about the best shoe shop in charlotte for folks who dont have to live by name brands its close to uptown and the selection will cover just about any scenario happy feet make for happy shopping im sold stay calm ladies deep breaths yes it is overwhelming when you walk in but just try to take your time there are so many shoe options that it is like therapy just to walk up and down each row sigh i am relaxed just thinking about it all of your favorite designers mine bcbg and the latest styles i also get a lot of my purses here they have the latest in cool bags as well as clutches for any red carpet occasion save your encore rewards it is straight cash back on your next order love my shoe warehouse stars i guess i am one of the few who are not madly in love with this place which is fine with me when i walked in here i was hoping for a dsw type feel but cheaper since its a shoe department store i was looking to spend no more than for a decentgood pair of black stilettos for work wrong even their clearance shoes are typically bones in the grand scheme of things their prices are affordable just not for someone on my tight budget you can definitely find what you need there just not for what youd hope to spend on it i got a pair of black stilettos on clearance for so i dont have too much to complain about but i walked away feeling a bit financially violated positives good selection large clearance section cheap sunglasses negatives the prices you can get cheaper and better shoes at nordstrom rack if you feel like making the drive down south blvd the security guard who follows you around because you are definitely going to steal tons of shoes when you walk in with just a wallet come on dude where am i stashing a pair of heels get away from me is it just me or are their purses outlandishly expensive go to tjmaxx for a much classier find and a lower price tag just my thoughts good luck stars rounding up to shoes shoes shoes clearly if you like shoes off broadway is a worth the stop while you probably wont find super high end designer brands this location works just fine to scoop up a pair of tahari pumps adidas running shoes or a myriad of enzo angiolini footwear theres also a small selection of handbags with brands like anne klein and big buddha the store is clean nicely organized and full of friendly employees whether youre looking for mens or womens shoes athletic or dress types off broadway is worth the trip be sure to save your receipts as youll receive from each purchase as credit on your next purchase about as large as a small wal mart this is truly a warehouse of shoes and surprisingly not all womens shoes there is a large section of shoes for men too i stuck to my side of the shop and saw that the shoes were organized by style boots laceups slip ons and such were all neatly put together with one on display and a stack of others underneath with a variety of sizes i have average size feet so its rare that there is any problem finding shoes in my size that fit after i had narrowed down my selection to just two and was walking around to test comfort i spotted their clearance racks in the back had a pair of the style i wanted in my size so instead of buying a full price marked down pair at i got a last pair in store with a discount that was a name brand timberlake for boom when you shop at off broadway you also get an encore rewards coupon for of your spending that you can use on your next visit i cant imagine that ill be back for shoes again and remember this coupon but hey you never know after being turned onto this place by my girlfriend ill admit im a fan they wont have the latest styles but they have plenty of great late model shoes to browse through i probably wouldnt suggest this place for a real sport shoe like running or whatever your sport is but the dress shoe selection and casual shoes here are great always clean and friendly service and not to mention a rewards program will keep you coming back for sure youve got to be kidding if you want hot shoes at discount prices go to a marshalls with a shoe superstore or ebay these shoes are cheap but expensive if you know what i mean i guess if youre barefoot and need something to put on your feet or if youre looking for sparkly or spiked hooker pumps off broadway will do but really stars maybe the guy shoe section is better wont be back to find out btw staff are super nice this place has the anne hathaway effect going for it what do i mean by that some days hathaway looks absolutely gorgeous other days well lets just say the lighting must be super bad off broadway has the same kind of thing going for it one trip i find absolutely nothing next trip i have to explain to myself why i dont need to buy five pairs of shoes boots sneakers heels flats flippy floppys great variety and selection sometimes you can find items on sale that are an absolute steal make sure to check the very back wall of the store sale racks full of deep discounted kicks off broadway also has a rewards program you get a certain amount of points on your purchases it can add up to receive coupons to use at the store this is a revamp of its old program where the rewards were instant a dollar amount printed at the top of your receipt that could be used on your next purchase workers are always super nice and helpful location is convenient off south blvd good luck trying to make a left turn out of this place i dont even try it anymore because of the heavy traffic this store has been a favorite of mine since the days when it was located off of morehead street oodles of shoes that so overwhelm me that i have to take one look down each aisle before selecting tootsie wear to try on my last visit i found the club type music very loud and distracting of course they display many pairs of clubbing shoes so i guess it is appropriate i have so many pairs of stilettos that i decided to shop for fitness shoes since i needed an upgrade they had several brands to choose from and i selected sketchers this shoe store also has racks of sale shoes toward the back of the store i found a colorful pair of flip flops featuring rhinestone dragonflies which were too cute to ignore i was disappointed to discover that i could no longer use my previous sakes receipt to save money on the shoes they have started a new program which doesnt teem to offer the instant gratification of the old system still i will stop by to play parade around in and purchase the shoes its what we gals do for women this store has probably anything you could want the possibilities seemed endless probably of the floor space was for womens shoes for the men there was a pretty big selection but i still walked out empty handed i went in looking for a couple pairs of dress shoes and was pretty disappointed the few pairs that i did like i ended up putting back because they were all over and for brands that i wasnt even familiar with that may or may not last the year at that price point or a little over i can go to any department store and get quality name brand dress shoes i actually known will last me}
{2361, Jerusalem Middle Eastern Cuisine, 601 S Wright St Champaign IL 61820, the restaurant itself is small place with a bad lighting looks like an old and unloved place by its owner the owner usually has an attitude towards the customers hes angry and look fiercely in your eyes as if you shouldnt be there to taste his cooking it is not irritating though i feel its more funny and something to laugh at with friends its a one man show by the way he is the cook and the counter holder works almost like a fast food except for the fact that it is not fast now the food itself ive had shawerma here as well as falafel and some other stuff which i cant remember their names by far the meal you want to order in this restaurant is the shawerma having said that i prefer the gyros from zorbas which is just minutes walking south of this place they are more tender and juicy and the bread in their gyro is much better i always walk past this place but never thought of trying it because it looks kinda shady it is usually pretty empty lunch or dinner time so i have no clue how this place survives one day my friend ordered some falafel and grape leaves wrap for takeout just for the heck of it she was a little unsure if she wanted to try them and i ended up being the scapegoat the food wasnt fresh and my friend saw the guy reheating the food in a microwave instead of preparing them from scratch the falafel ended up a little dry and the little leave wraps were sour i was not sure if it was supposed to taste like that but i found it awful maybe i should try the shwarma instead this is my new favorite restaurant in chambana ive now tried the falafal shawarma and lamb kebab sandwiches and theyre all some of the best ive ever had the falafal is very fresh and moist not your typical dried out american falafal the yogurt salad is homemade and the perfect side for any of their sandwiches also the samosas are lightly fried and delicately delicious this place is also incredibly cheap really too cheap i dont know how they stay in business with these prices the actual physical space is modestly decorated with middle eastern art and photos its sort of subtly charming its a casual and comfortable place to sit and its nice and cool during the summer give this restaurant a try it rivals the best middle eastern food ive had in new york and chicago and even the middle east itself this place is fantastic i eat lunch here at least once a week have not tried it for dinner i know middle eastern food well and have eaten falafel in many cities the falafel sandwich is one of the best ive ever had the yogurt salad yogurt with cucumber mint parsley etc is delicious and the lamb kebab sandwich is also fantastic the prices are amazing this place is so far above most of the junk you find on green st i highly recommend turning on to wright st instead of continuing on green when looking for a tasty inexpensive lunch near campus they also have incredible meat and spinach pies and a samosa with the most delicate tasty shell ive ever had its definitely a hole in the wall but the owner plays jazz blues and middle eastern music or the news which makes it a pleasant place to sit and eat its a must try the complaints ive heard about this restaurant are numerous ranging from bad food to the infamous soup nazi like owner so why did i give it so many stars many people would hesitate before eating at jerusalem restaurant and i cant blame them if they have been spoiled by american restaurant standards in defense of these kinds of restaurants everywhere i would argue that you have to be at least a little adventurous and patient when it comes to eating ethnic food ive become a regular customer because jerusalem restaurant is just so strange and kind of endearing in its own way i know that there are limitations to excusing poor serviceattitude because of cultural differences but i have never thought of the owner as malicious or incompetent every visit one of my friends makes an attempt to get the owner to smile ive witnessed it and it is a truly uplifting sight below ive documented some of my observations while eating there i know that these are probably factors that cast the restaurant in a bad light but personally these are the type of experiences that have made me come to enjoy at least for humor value my visits to jerusalem restaurant read on i first came into jerusalem restaurant with friends and we all decided to order the daily combination plate when we got to the counter and placed our orders the owner just asked each of us meat or vegetable we all requested meat assuming that we would just receive whatever he was making for the daily meat dish to our confusion when we received the meals we each had been given a different meat lamb fish and chicken we learned later that you can just request a specific meat i have struggled to decipher the numbering logic used at this restaurant this is the first example when you look at the front counter there are sheets of paper that show a condensed menu just the most popular items served at lunch instead of writing combo combo etc their items are listed as etc not even in sequential order this is the second example involving weird numbers after you order the owner will write a number on a piece of scrap paper and hand it to you this number is separate from the receipt so it does not correspond to the price of your meal my friend and i thought it over and we interpreted this as the same system employed at fast food restaurants where your number is called when your order is ready when we looked my number was and my friends was again not sequential even when he had ordered right after me then when our food was finished the owner just waved at us instead of calling our numbers huh unlike most restaurants the owner doesnt leave unlimited boxes of napkins at the silverware station or your table instead he leaves just a few napkins less than at the front counter so you always feel bad about taking more than necessary great economicenvironmental tactic ill briefly summarize a few more important points if you decide to try jerusalem restaurant order the spiced hot tea in the winter the restaurant is only open for lunch not dinner and no matter how much youre initially intimidated by the owner he is actually a warm person once you become familiar with him great food great place to get together with friends great prices dont be intimidated by the owner he might come off as anti social but he is a nice guy once you get to know him give the place a shot you wont regret it i personally love the falafal my classmate and i went here recently because we hadnt heard anything about it and were feeling adventurous the food was actually pretty good and i at least left satisfied but this may have been for of the same reason i thought the th fast and the furious movie was pretty good i wasnt expecting much highlights fairly cheap probably not as bad as you think the quality of the food is inconsistent i used to love their falafel but the last time i had it it was so bitter it wasnt edible the guy who works there seems very stressed and angry he doesnt ever smile the prices are good and when the food is good it is decent of all restaurants in chambana this is by far my favorite i used to go several times as week for either lunch or dinner when i was still in the area the food is homemade like which was always a big plus for me i prefer to be on the healthy side and jerusalem offers that option with the bonus of being cheap and this fact makes it unique in a college town where most people are craving for cheap junk food i would go most frequently for the plate of the day with chicken it is a big tray with an assortment of tasty items so big that sometimes you would end up saving half of it for dinner i can more simply define jerusalem as tasty tasty tasty totally love it ah yes the owner some people complain about him well after going for so many times i found out he is a very warm person he might not give you a fake smile the first time you walk into his restaurant but he will give you a genuine smile the fifth time you go there wonderful hummus and everything else too take your chances with the plate of a day its a bargain and an adventure and youll get delightful hummus pita salad and rice along with the special items of the day the service can be a little slow since its one man running the show but he takes his time with each persons order and serves up tasty plates the arabian tea is also delish the food is quite good and reasonable it can get busy at lunch and the owner does seem a bit frustrated at times but he is always very kind and gracious i love giving him the business and i love the taste of his food i give it stars because service can be hit or miss pros shawarma sandwich was decent kefta kabob meat was not bad ordered kefta kabob plate cons ambiance plate of the day was not that great the day i went in at least rest of food being mediocre passed by this place every day went in to check it out at the suggestion of a friend though i had friends who went there often i didnt go back and dont really plan to i know other reviewers took issue with the interior of the restaurant or the attitude of the owner but i absolutely love jerusalem for its excellent food the hummus is to die for so creamy we usually get the dish of the day all the vegetable dishes ive tried are very yummy especially the spinach dish and there are many options if you are a vegetarian my personal favorite is the fish its fried tender and juicy without being greasy and seasoned perfectly with a hint of spiciness the most important reason why i always prefer jerusalem to other restaurant options in the area is that all dishes taste like home made food prepared according to traditional recipes with great care its cheap but definitely not cheaply prepared great food and good specials i recommend the lunch plate its a ton of food for the spiced tea hot or cold is delicious too just awesome vegetarian plate is great cheap and healthy inexpensive solid falafel and fries good mint tea nice to have a place with solid cheap eats in the middle of campus town my favorite place to eat in urbana champaign extratasty healthy both the owner and the cook are very nice calm and quiet environment sometimes slow the best deal is probably the plate of the day for you get a share sized or after workout sized meal consisting of various sides rice cooked veggies legumes hummus salad pita bread and your choice of meat when i come alone i usually get something smaller most often falafel sandwich delicious rice and veggies small for lentil soup small for dolmeh stuffed grape leaves is great too but rather expensive their tea especially the cold mint tea in the summer is excellent and is included in the plate of the day i tried the chicken shawrma sandwich it was good but wait time is too long restaurant review do you remember that episode in seinfeld at the soup restaurant i wont refer to the name given to the owner of that restaurant but this experience is very similar you go up to the counter to order from a surly man who is cooking and running the register he will ignore you for a few minutes and finally come over to take your order you sit down and after a few more minutes or more he will yell your food is ready with only the bare minimum of words not the best customer service but i digress the upside is the food is inexpensive compared to chicago there are daily specials i ended up with the lamb dish with rice split pea soup and some beans the flavors were very authentic not too salty or spicy i just wish the lamb was not cooked way through for the price you pay it is good but the food would not be acceptable restaurant quality in a big city all said and done i will be back if i crave mediterranean food pro inexpensive authentic middle eastern food cons average food quality overcooked poor customer service no free refills hidden gem daily specials are a bargain check out my picture for the menu im surprised by some of the positive reviews this place has received the food is horrible and having lived near jerusalem let me tell you the food here has nothing to do with jerusalem just not worth going very good food the one guy that works there and takes the orders does a good job at cooking it all too i always get the steak shawarma he closes pretty early for dinner so be sure to not get there within the last or minutes because he will only let you order it to go this is my favorite place in c u for a quick cheap lunch i always get the falafel sandwich combo which isnt anything mind blowing but also never disappoints atmosphere is very relaxed and the restaurant is never too crowded i am always comfortable here the guy at the counter is pretty stony faced but hes always polite when you order hell give you a number that as far as i can tell is totally random i wonder if theres some kind of secret pattern to them not sure id evem give them star false advertising menu on yelp states lentil soup is made with olive oil upon driving out of way here i was informed by an authentic looking sounding soup nazi that its soy oil there will be no soup for me here im new to the area and wanted to try the local middle eastern cuisine as back home i am blessed with a nice variety of it in the southwest suburbs i went into the just about empty jerusalem restaurant and looked over the menu before being silently greeted by the notorious owner i stepped up to order and he turned his back apparently cooking someone elses food i patiently waited and eventually ordered the daily special of kufta salad and hummus after observing my meal being cooked and assembled i dashed home to try it i opened up everything and was initially let down by the quantity i received for about i started with the salad which looked to be a combination of many different vegetables including onions celery carrots spices and a couple of other unrecognizable things even though there was a large array of different ingredients for this salad it was unbelievably bland and some of the vegetables pretty hard in consistency i couldnt figure out why there was some kind of a dressing on it but it wasnt much more than some type of oil maybe a really light olive im not sure it then occurred to me that this salad was probably sitting for a very long time before i had eaten it i wouldnt get it again next my order came with kufta lamb beef pitas and a very small dollop of hummus the kufta had a pretty unique flavor to it that i did like but the quality of the meat was fair at best the pitas were decent but by far the best part of my dinner was the hummus the hummus had a very nice taste and was complemented well by a splash of olive oil it was not bland and definitely the highlight of my meal overall i was disappointed having spent almost the portion size wasnt much and the starch pita is really what filled me up i will be back in sometime just to try something else and see if my review is consistent for all the food rather than just what i had this place has a variety of options and maybe i just picked the wrong one this place was way worse than what i expected theres only one grumpy person running the whole place so it took forever for the food to get ready he doesnt talk or even smile servings are small for the price for my meal and the food was not fresh falafels were like subways and i think they were frozen no spice or taste at all no silverware or glassware whatsoever everything was disposable we ended up paying for people without any drinks he has shawerma but no gyros machine all i saw was shredded pieces of meat that he heats up im never coming back to this place honestly my expectations couldnt have been faltered this much my first and last time overpriced for a small portion and bland love the tea here you will not want to go back to panera tea after youve had the brewed mint tea iced tea is just as good i dont know what he does or puts in it but this man knows his tea the food is simple a little plain but good never gotten fries here but the hummus is smooth and has a nice flavor with good quality olive oil the pitas are warm and fresh and you get two so they will fill you up and i actually like the kufta here better than layalinas which is saying something because i love that place but am not a fan of their kufta lentil soup is also tasty and filling the falafel does leave something to be desired i also dont mind the guy behind the counter if you absolutely must be kowtowed to with fake enthusiasm and mock pleasure to serve you this is not your place this guy smiles at you its genuine i knew the reputation of this place going in but i am a sucker for homemade falafel pea soup turkish coffee and hummus so i went in anyway my mistake the old man at the counter ignored me for a while which im used to being eastern european and when it came time to talk to me he managed to treat me very well compared to the previous male customer whom he ushered away without a word again i dont care about customer service too much but after getting the vegetarian special and ordering the turkish coffee to go i saw the old man throw a bunch of bread in the microwave he continued to cook the rest of my food mainly by reheating things and frying precooked and frozen falafel after this he proceeded to make and overfill a very bad cup of turkish coffee for me too basically the falafel was the same as the frozen falafel you can buy at a store because thats what it seemingly was the bread was tasteless the hummus more bitter than the russian cold and the coffee tasted like the s the old man tried his best i am sure but the food was sad like my soul after visiting this restaurant this restaurant serves very healthy food love the plate of the day best option for vegetarians in champaign urbana alright the owner really tries the tea here is excellent and the falafel has improved greatly food is very fresh here i am a big fan of jerusalem these days i can see the one and only guy cooking taking orders and cleaning freshness of food and the guys dedication to serve quality food impressed me nonetheless i see some reviews complaining about an absence of smiley welcome or food being served late its up to you folks go to a chain restaurant if you want it fast with lots of smiles whatever makes you happy the food was incredibly good i highly recommend the chicken kabob sandwhich you come in here and dont expect much but the food is phenomenol going to come here more often and the prices are great too great food for a great price chicken is cooked to a perfection came here for a quick eat and left with a new appreciation for middle eastern food daily specials get you full with less than other reviews say this but it must be emphasized it is just one guy seven days a week cooking cleaning taking orders of course there is no american friendliness but service is very professional and prompt it shows in the restaurant which is well decorated and spotlessly clean i had the beef and lamb shawarma sandwich with fries and a drink which ran me about you decide whether thats a good price he made my food to order so it took about mins he didnt have a rotating doner like mashawi instead the meat is pre sliced and he cooks it on a grill that some yogurt sauce onions and tomato go into a pita bread its a standard shawarma and theres nothing to complain about veggies are fresh meat could use a bit more flavor is all the shawarma here is more along the lines of the traditional arab shawerma the one at mashawi is more durum style like a wrap so it depends on what youre feeling jerusalem was my favorite place to eat the years i was there amazing fresh and healthy food that is prepared in a no nonsense sort of way hameed the guy who works there does everything and does a remarkable job of running the place if you go often enough he is kind enough to give you a little something extra with every meal order the fish is excellent with the lunch special there are so many diverse cultural experiences to be had in champaign and thats what really makes this community so great we integrate together by sharing stories of home through our food heritage today brought me to jerusalem middle eastern cuisine parking was very convenient call it luck but i got a wonderful spot right outside the restaurant with metered parking the interior is decorated in middle eastern arabic themes some telling stories of being at the mosque others depicting cities in rich watercolor or arabic writings the menu is tasty and varied lots of options of meats vegetables and other middle eastern delights i choose the special beef and lamb shwarma to go with turkish coffee and the owner was super nice compared to what some reviews say i waited about minutes and done done my food was ready the turkish coffee was piping hot and lightly sweetened yet the taste was out of this world refreshing delicious and politely sweetened the notes smelling it were of sage turmeric as well as other spices the shwarma had a similar flavor and it was still pretty delicious yet different i will say i wish the lamb had more body and wasnt so falling apart there wasnt much tenderness the beef was very tasty and i loved the sauce overall i will return to try something different i did however commit the crime of putting my coffee over ice living a little still very flavorful and delicious}

and his mom we were visiting las vegas from sf and wanted all to get a nice pedicure my boyfriend go the hot stone pedicure he was very happy and fell asleep in the chair and we both got the deluxe pedicure they did a great job but what put this place to stars was the excellent customer service all of the nail technicians introduced themselves to us asked us how we were and if the water was okay

the deluxe pedicure totally worth the extra plus my eyebrows waxed i will definitely be back im so glad i yelpd it this place is the best their ice cream pedicures are awesome how was this place not jammed pack i walked in here last monday afternoon in hopes of getting a manipedi i am on the hunt for a new nail salon after polished nails which is right nearby has just done me so wrong see updated review i looked up walking distance nail salons and diamond nails pops up not a lot of reviews but all good i decided to give it a try i am so glad i did i walked in as a new client and the receptionist was so sweet they offered water which was awesome since i walked in the vegas heat and didnt rush me at all she told me hoa would be doing my nails he was the best the massage chairs were great while i sat there i do wish they had some magazines to read though my blackberry kept me pretty entertained though the best part of this pedicure was the foot massage i am pretty sure hoa has magical massage powers that was the best foot massage i have ever had why did it have to end i was so relaxed he is my new go to with pedicures just for that foot massage wow i am dreaming about it now as soon as the pedi is done he takes me over to this desk by this time every employee in the salon has greeted me and asked how i was so friendly even the girl at the next station striked up a conversation with me while i got my mani on again no rush they also dont soak your hands in water which i love because did you know that makes your nail polish not last as long hoa however did wrap each hand in a hot towel covered with plastic while he worked on the other hand felt so good again another great massage this time the hands does he know he is removing so much stress from my life geesh i need to go back weekly he treated each nail as if it was a canvas and he was the artist i didnt get any crazy things done just my normal lincoln park after dark color but he still treated each coat like it was a masterpiece hoa seriously impressed me here i know i will be back they strive to do good for their customers so friendly and the prices arent awful either dollars for a manicure and for a pedicure if you get them together though it comes to works for me they also have a referral program that sounds great dollar credit for each client that says you sent them mention my name and yelp haha diamond nails did me so good i am also proud to report my color has stayed on almost a full week hope i didnt just jinx it it has usually chipped by now but i am happy to say it is still in tact woohoo to whatever top coat they put on my mom and i tried this place based on the yelp reviews that i read and we were not disappointed diamond nails was busy for a monday afternoon but the staff was extremely friendly and got us in quickly the price for a basic pedicure was dollars which in my experience is about the norm if even a little on the cheap side sam the owner is so nice and really makes sure that your experience is relaxing and enjoyable they have several different pedicure options and from what i saw they have tons of different things for your fingernails as well all in all this was a fantastic place with a welcoming staff who make the place somewhere you want to come back to my mom and i have found our new pedicure place thank you yelp i found this place from the other reviews and i am so happy i did i called to make an appointment just to be safe because i was short on time from the girl who answered the phone to every single person working in the salon great customer service if i hadnt been short on time i would have tried one of the pampering treatments as it was my pedi was great btw i had tien do my pedi i chose the extra treatment as my pedi was more than overdue so the pedi was normally totally worth it btw they also have the shellac that makes your mani ped last for over weeks the mani shellac is only i will be sending everyone i know hands down the best pedicure ive ever had i choose the hot stone pedicure tina did a fantastic job and her massage rivals any ive had at a spa the staff was friendly and everyone thanked me for coming in diamond nails is a real gem i tend to nail salon hop a few places i stuck with for a while but was never truly satisfied the place was clean and the staff was really friendly and pleasant prices for basic manipedi are pretty similar to other salons i was disappointed in their nail polish color selection and when i sit in a massage chair i want to feel it it was hardly a vibration on my shoulders the chair and colors are big sellers for me i could care less if my nail person doesnt want to hold a conversation with me im usually there to relax anyway and would rather not talk the pedicure was okay ive had better nothing different about it i liked that they open a new sterilized kit right in front of you the manicure was okay too i didnt get an armhand massage with lotion like most places give but she did wrap my hands in hot moist towels before my polish which was nice the rewards programreferral bonus would be the only reason i go back diamond nails takes the business to an outstanding level i looked up nail salons on yelp while on vacation in las vegas for my birthday because i didnt have time to get them done at home by regular technician i must say that the reviews did not let me down the employees at diamond nails offer their clients the utmost respect courtesy and friendliness they took their time in helping me find what i wanted furthermore they are excellent at what they do i received a pedicure and shellach manicure gel polish on july and neither have chipped or peeled and it has been over weeks i will definitely be returning to diamond nails anytime im in vegas and will recommend them to anyone i know or anyone who is looking for a nail salon these people were really helpful the prices and services are wonderful i never had such an awesome pedicure my peanut toes looked so straight lol they offer a variety of services with an assortment of polishgel colors at different price points great relaxing atmosphere with nice music i will be going there to get my nails done now also indulge yourself you deserve it after putting off getting my nails done down in orange county before heading to vegas i found myself searching for a decent nail place up there not wanting to pay a ridiculous amount to get my nails done at the strip i decided to yelp it i came across diamond nails and saw that it got good reviews and decided to give it a go and im glad i did when i had called to set up an appointment they were very very friendly when i got there everyone there they were super nice and welcoming the place was super clean and neat the owner thuy ended up doing my nails she was the sweetest ever also her husband sam was the nicest guy and it turns out she used to work at the spa at the venetian so it was basically like getting my nails done at the spas on the strip at half the price i totally enjoyed getting my nails done here also she hooked it up my boyfriend went with me so the four of us were having a conversation about everything they were the warmest people ever and made us feel like home next time i go to vegas i will definitely be coming back great pedicure manicure very clean very friendly staff they did a great job at making my feet smooth the hot stone massage was wonderful we were in lv on vacation wanted something good not vegas hotel expensive they need to invest in new polishes though they mostly have opi older colors go for essie diamond nails people who know good polish will search for those salons who have essie choose that salon over any others bring your own polish youre set they will up sell you just an fyi not making negative commentary here we all realize that people are in business to make as long as you have integrity while doing it we can always say no thanks a bit expensive for the hot stone each but overall a great place while visiting vegas for my birthday i really wanted to get a pedicure i got lost and arrived at diamond nails about a half hour before closing but noticed that they continued to happily accept clients as they came in they didnt even rush like most nails places do when close to closing time i chose to get the hot stone pedicure was it an hour in heaven why yes damn straight i got warm towels a foot spa various yummy smelling creams and scrubs and best of all a thorough massage i chose a simple french pedicure which still looks sparkly and perfect when i am rich i plan to come here on a daily basis i love diamond nails i actually shouldve just went here for my rockstar mani but the other nail place did a good job as well theyre usually busy but for the work that they do it is expected and that is the reason why i went to the other salon last min o i came here to do a couples manipedi a couple of weeks ago and ended up getting the shellac for me and i also got the delux pedi my bf got the hot stone foot massage let me tell you they did an excellent job they give you massages with your hands and your feet my bf loved it and he also loved the fact they had massage chairs and they were even willing to close their curtains for us to make it a little more private im going to have to go back here again my shellac lasted about weeks and my pedi lasted a little bit longer i finally went at the begging of my daughter who is a regular i loved them the staff was very personable and professional i had the mani pedi and must say that tina did an excellent job i will definitely be back they also have a discount offers for regulars and a great referral program i received awesome service hubby and i went there while in vega for our anniversary we both got pedis and i received the no chip mani great great customer service we got water in convo we mentioned it was our anniversary and they gave us a awesome smelling lotion and little crystals for my nails in a gift bag and a card so thougtful they did a great job and sooo nice we will def go back our next visit to vegas i loved this place i went in for a pedicure the salon is very cute and welcoming everyone was super nice and the receptionist took care of me right away she was really sweet i got the hot stone pedicure and it was unbelievable totally relaxing and it made my feet feel so smooth and soft the girl who did it was amazing i cant remember her name she gave the very best massage i loved the hot stones i could feel the stress melt away i loved that there was privacy too they pulled a curtain around me and it made me feel like a vip i was offered water and magazines as soon as i sat down and the manager came and made sure i was comfy the massage chairs were great too if i had to make one complaint it was about a customer in the salon she was so loud they had the tv on a football game which was odd to me and she was yelling an screaming and when she talked she talked loud enough for the whole place to hear her conversation that was a little awkward and the only downfall not the salons fault at all i cannot wait to go back here for my next pedi i will probably get a mani too i highly recomend this place tried diamond based on reviews and am very satisfied and appreciative of fellow yelpers feedback as i found experience to be as positive as everyone else the deluxe pedicure really was deluxe all types of masks scrubs creams truly relaxing and the most thorough pedicure i have had ever i had the express manicure and also very happy with results trinh is the sweet girl that worked on me and she was very detail oriented took her time and did a very good job the environment is calm and the owners pleasant and professional they addressed me by name many times through out my visit they dont have fancy chandeliers or dj booth but they do offer great service i definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a real manicure and pedicure worth the trip from the strip reasonably priced and the nail technicians are skilled and do good work the nail polish was perfect and not one smidgen of polish on my cuticles good massage and the products they use made my feet and hands very smooth the are very attentive and accommodating great service too bad i dont live in vegas thank you diamond for a fantastic mani and pedi they open at am which was super helpful when my friend and i had a million errands before a bachelorette we were out in an hour and my nails didnt chip at all and it doesnt hurt to have some nice eye candy the nail art guy my husband and i just moved to town and we have officially found our new nail place diamond nails is a professional establishment that is clean friendly and all about quality customer service jason gave me an amazing foot and leg massage one of the best ones ive had i highly recommend him he did a great job on my french pedicure the owners were so nice i also got my eyebrows done and its nice to know the owner helped open up the salon dept at cosmopolitan and she worked at the venetian her husband sam was so nice he gave us sandwiches after he found out the restaurant didnt have the ones my husband wanted to buy close by im sending my family and everyone i know here im sold and i will definitely be coming back ava b i went back to diamond recently and got the chocolate and champagne pedi the salon was fairly busy so i had to wait but it was totally worth it it was a perfect pedicure and its been over two weeks and i have no chips and my feet still feel smooth and amazing the atmosphere is great and everyone is so friendly i was also impressed that they took a customer after closing great customer service this is the best nail salon in vegas i wont go anywhere else soooooo i wanted to get a pedi in hawaii before i went to vegas but my oh so cute boyfriend wanted to spend sunday with me since i had to work the next couple days before i left sunday was supposed to be my pedi day but i told him id get a pedi in vegas instead of course i came to yelp to help me out and i came across diamond nails and liked the reviews its a little far from the strip but since i had a rental car im pretty good with directions and i like to drive i thought id make the trip it was fairly easy to find from the las vegas strip i arrived a little after opening and there were a few people getting pedis and manis i signed in and justin was my nail tech i had heard awesome reviews about the hot stone pedicure so i opted for that one never seen that on the menu in hawaii okay from cutting the nails to buffing to trimming to massaging everything was awesoooooome excellent superb then we got to the hot stones and well zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ohhhhhh crap i have to finish the review lol i was getting sleepy just thinking about the hot stone massage it was just oh gosh i dont even have words better than sex okay that may be a stretch lol sorry lemme keep this g rated but um seriously it was pretty damn fabulous i kept falling asleep and justin bless his heart kept asking me if it felt okay or if i liked it homie im falling asleep of course im okay and i like it lol he definitely knows how to massage and it was probably the best massage because you get a hot stone massage and regular massage score that ive ever had sad that this place isnt in hawaii the only gripe id have to say and i have to gripe because honesty is the best policy is that i looooove my french tips and im kinda anal about them his technique for the french tip needs a little work because it wasnt even and both sides didnt match i mean it wasnt completely off or anything but enough that it kinda bothered me but since the hot stone massage and regular massage was so so so good it outweighted the french tips so i didnt say anything okay wait one more gripe one of my toes chipped by the end of my vacation i was in vegas for days and by the time i got home most of it chipped off as well so my pedi didnt last me a full week without chipping if i had the chance to go back id get the hot stone pedi again but instead of french id just get one color if i have justin you were still great with the massage though other staff are friendly and the facility is super clean with ample parking my mother and i went to get manicures for a friends wedding i had a lovely french tip manicure by trudi sp i dont think i spelled her name correctly she was very friendly and gave us bottled water to sip on my french tip was the perfect thickness and completely even she followed my requests to trimming my nails super short which many manicurist tend to balk at my request i was very pleased with my french tip manicure and would recommend this place to others i would definitely return again to do my nails the next time im in vegas side note my mothers manicurist did spend a lot of time on my mothers gel extensions which made up for the initial painful removal of her previous acrylic nails i just moved to vegas a few months ago and have been looking for a great nail salon well i found it their salon is very clean decorated nice tvs relaxing music and the staff were so welcoming even the bathrooms had nice smelling candles and extra feminine products just in case when i first came in for a gel manicure the receptionist greeted me and answered all questions i had i only had to wait about minutes on a walk in which wasnt bad for the time i went in while waiting she handed me about color sample rings which was about different gel colors i couldnt believe their selection of colors i picked the rockstar diamonds the receptionist sat me at the nail station seat and offered me water tina did my gel nails and was so friendly and funny she made my time fun and was very good at doing my nails cut cuticles cleaned filed gel and hand massage i even asked if they did gel on toes and she was happy to do them right then too i was really impressed when the nail pro next to my station welcomed me when i told tina it was my first time there at other places they usually are very quiet or talking with coworkers staff here are very nice and speak good english overall this place is great i would recommend it to anyone cant wait for my friendsmom to visit so we can have a girls day get your nails done here and ask for tina this place is awesome they really take theyre time and theyre very clean the lady i saw was mai she was very attentive and made sure she wasnt too rough every time she was finished with something she made sure that it was ok with me and the suggestions she made for my colors were right on point the system they have is really good too after ur th visit u get off ur services which is great cuz all us girls need discounts for our nails n feet i am definitely making this the only nail spot i go to in vegas oh n if u wanna indulge ur feet i suggested the ice cream sundae pedicure this place was heaven compared to the ct nails debacle i had to endure the day before the lady who helped me i believe her name was kim was so sweet and kind she was very gentle and did a wonderful job on my nails i first wanted to try powder gel and get acrylic nails but she advised me against it she said my nails were so healthy and nice that getting acrylic would only ruin my nails and make them unhealthy she also said that id have to come back every weeks to get fillings for acrylics she told me that other places would just do it to make the extra money but she wouldnt do it for me even though shed be making more money off of it i honestly really respected her candid response and took her advice to heart so i settled for regular gel manicure for and was very pleased with the results instead of soaking my fingers she wrapped my entire hand in a hot towel to soften the skin i really felt the difference when she was removing my cuticles she also was extremely diligent and proficient when applying the gel color she found a bump where a glitter was sticking up and instead of saying it was finenormal she went and buffed it out and re did it on her own without me having to ask so it was perfect she also commiserated with me when i told her about my awful experience at ct nails she said an express pedicure should never take more than minutes more like and the fact that i spent with just a pedicure done was unacceptable it felt good to complain to someone and have a sympathetic listening ear lol needless to say i was very pleased by her sweet demeanor and great work ethic she recommended that i come back next time for their deluxe pedicures which include ice cream chocolate and champagne pedicures i am definitely going to come back here next time im in vegas this place is awesome wonderful nail salon my only complaint was how expensive they are but compared to v nails and all my other regular spots this is the best of the best every time i roll through vegas i always stop by diamond nails for a manipedi ive been coming to this salon ever since my bestie and i found it in a random search for a last minute pedi the staff has always been warm and welcoming and they are a big part of why we keep coming back the spa pedicure is the best they take their time massaging your feet and your feet are left tingly and beautiful and finally i tried their gel mani for the first time today and i am excitingly impressed my bestie has been raving about their gel manis forever and i am not disappointed this is the best secret salon south of the strip this is by far the best nail salon i have been to in vegas after repeated bad experiences of getting cut literally on every finger nails filed down to the skin pain shooting up my arms bubbles and roughness on the acrylic etc i didnt even want to try acrylic nails ever again i decided to give it one more shot though and went to diamond nails the experience you get there is what it should be at a nail salon everyone in there takes pride in what they do they all are hard workers and very friendly they make you feel welcome and are very pleasant thuy is the one who does my nails and she is such a sweetheart she does a wonderful thorough job and she is very gentle which i appreciate i love this place and i highly recommend it ive been sending everyone who compliments my nails there you guys are wonderful keep doing what you do thank you for always making my experience a great one awesome as usual the epitome of customer service they are so friendly and accommodating questions and services are offered and explained before any questions can be asked a lot of businesses can learn a lot from how they deal with people i havent had an experience like ive had at diamond nail on a long time and its not too much either some people are just fake about it but they are truly genuine and cool about it the color selection is crazy ive never seen so much gel nail polish options im usually very overwhelmed w options which in this case is a great thing i come in to this place so often its like im walking into cheers im always greeted with friendly hellos and welcome backs how are yous we havent seen you in so longs its great the rewards program is awesome and tiffany is the perfect and most friendly host always checking if everythings ok and if theres anything we need shes always on point with points and when you get your receipt its broken down perfectly all of the nail techs are excellent they take their time and do the job well this is my local nail spot they always take care of me i wish i could give more stars i love diamond nails it is a good minutes away from my house and worth every second of the drive my manicures never chip or peel they are so gentle on your nail beds and tough on my cuticles plus i find that my nails last twice as long as if i went to another salon the pedicures rock my world none of that bs minute massage they are legit ill never go anywhere else i absolutely love this nail place it is the only place i will go kory is the best my nails always look great they know me by name when i walk in and always offer beverages the best place in vegas i highly recommend diamond nails and specifically kory yelp challenge started of i have a lot of catching up to do i am so happy that i found this place and it is right in my neighborhood my girlfriends and i frequent this shop bi weekly to get both pedicures and gel manicures we love that all the women in here are friendly accomodating and are good and detailed at what they do they clean your nails up real good cut them down to size massage your hands and feet real good give you a bottle of water to hydrate and have a wide variety of nail colors especially gel colors to choose from they even have a menu of different pedicures you can get from express to even something involving food in it they offer wax services of course and even glitter body art for all you bikini wearers in the summer definitely a treat what i like too is that they have a rewards program off after your th visit sweet if you frequent the nail salon i highly recommend this place just make sure to make an appointment this place is hot i get my nails done here often i love their prices sometimes there is a long wait but to be expected when youre good my favorite nail technician is jennifer as a recent transplant from the sf bay area i was in dire need of a manipedi but didnt know where to go decided to yelp a nail spot which led me to daimond nails staff the staff is very friendly and you will notice that they are busy both with walk ins and appointments you will also observe that there are enough employees to cater to the high volume of customers wait time wasnt long which was a plus sanitary i am ocd when it comes to cleanliness so i especially appreciated that the receptionist cleaned and disinfected the pedicure spa station basins in between appointments service i went mid level price ranges from by opting for the hot stone massage pedicure package which also includes a handforearm massage sam a man was my manipedicurist and masseuse selection they have a good selection of gelishshellacopi in addition to regular nail polish total cost of gelish mani and hot stone massage pedi was tip i was there for a total of hours summary all in all yes i plan to return especially convenient if youre on the sw side of lv very easy going atmosphere everyone was very friendly at the salon they are currently expanding to include waxing and lashes the actual pedicure was fabulous i had the nd level for and it was worth every penny i was beyond impressed with this nail salon i previously frequented a different salon for my manipedis and finally became fed up with their poor service this led me to diamond nails which had such great reviews and fellow yelpers never lie my boyfriend and i decided to get deluxe pedicures it was about minutes of pure bliss we did have to wait about minutes for chairs next to each other but it was no big deal at all since i spent most of that time picking out my polish the actual pedicure was so amazing it was filled with soaking a delicious smelling exfoliant a mint mask and mint lotion with massages in between it all my toenails came out perfect and i was very happy the service is excellent here and the lady who worked on my feet was very nice everyone here speaks english very well not that it matters to me im part vietnamese so im used to the accent anyway the pedicure was worth every cent and i for see many future visits here to try out their different services i looked up this place on yelp before my trip to vegas to visit a friend the reviews were great so i thought i would give it a chance i really wish i could take this place back to san diego with me i would be a regular the services i received were a manicure with the opi shellac polish deluxe pedicure and an eyebrow wax my nails are cut perfectly short like i like them and nicely shaped ive had a few shellac manicures and this one is set a lot better the pedicure was heavenly my feet were tingling for an hour after from all the wonderful mask and treatments my eyebrows are pretty the salon is very clean and they dont skimp on the lotions and use all good stuff this is the best nail salon i have been too friendly staff great customer service on my next trip out to vegas i plan on going here again thank you fellow yelpers for the great recommendation my eleven year old daughter and i went in for a treat today and a treat is exactly what we got yes we had to wait about minutes because we didnt have an appointment but it was well worth the wait we both had the deluxe pedicure and it was probably the best pedicure i have ever had mai was so meticulous and did a wonderful job of pampering my tired feet and helping me relax even the woman who did my daughters pedi was super sweet and treated her as if she was a regular customer not a child we felt so pampered and loved that our feet tingled for the next few hours after our pedis next time we will definitely make an appointment and we will absolutely be back i searched on yelp for nail salons in vegas and found this one with high ratings and good reviews ive been to several salons in the area they were satisfactory diamond nails offers a variety of pedicure treatments sure it might cost you more than the average salon around the corner from home but you get what you pay for to me it was worth it figured i would play it safe and make an appointment on a saturday afternoon and sure enough it was packed when i arrived the staff was friendly and accommodating the wait time was less than minutes even after arriving a half hour early first visit i chose the hot stone treatment you are offered a bottle of drinking water to hydrate just before they work on you next thing i noticed for each customer they used sterilized tools enclosed in a sealed package kory a male pedicurist took his time during preparation and was friendly enough to have a conversation with during the treatment some pedicurist cant wait to work on your feet youre lucky if you even get a leg massage then to not say one word but ready to collect the entire experience was relaxing soothing and satisfying i think kory does a wonderful job as a pedicurist and alongside him stacey and james too both of whom have treated two close customers i know with satisfying results when kory was through he told me to sit back and relax while my toes were drying he was in no rush to have me pay for the services only when i was ready to get up and go im definitely returning to diamond nails hopefully soon and try their next level of spa pedicure treatment happy feet i was visiting lv and noticed my nails needed some love i yelped and this is one of the salons that had lots of good reviews if you are going here and searching for it i think the sign closest to the street says nails instead of diamond nails it can easily throw you off if you are looking for the sign to specifically say diamond nails its next to a korean restraunt i like trying new places so i did a walk in on a friday afternoon there were about a handful of customers and luckily mai was not with anyone she is really nice i asked for her based on previous reviews im glad i did bc she makes good conversation so its not awkward i opted for the express pedicure and gel manicure for the manicure they assigned me stacy the manager contacted me recently and said her name was natalie umm yeah either way i would play it safe and ask for mai at first everything was going well but as staceynatalie was cutting my cuticles i noticed how fast and hard she was doing it almost like she was in a hurry i didnt say anything though that is until she cut me yes there is a picture that i posted showing this i was so pissed she stared at my injury not really knowing what to do until the guy next to her who was doing someone elses pedicure handed her a bottle of antiseptic and apologized naturally this ruined my entire experience the manager came by and asked me what happened i showed him my bleeding cut and he apologized i could not trust staceynatalie to work on my other hand so i immediately asked for someone else mai offered to finish up my manicure for me which i was relieved about since she was gentle doing my pedicure and did a good job i really should have asked that mai do both pedi and mani from the get go unfortunately i didnt and ended up with an injured bloody finger i asked if staceynatalie was new and i was told she was not i would not have been as pissed if she had shown more concern i felt like she was rushing the manicure process hence the speed at which she was cutting my cuticles ok enough bitchin about that incident overall mai did a good job with both my pedi and gel manicure the cost for both was the express pedicure alone is and the gel manicure is oh you can also view their services and prices via their website i usually do my own manicures and i dont go to nail salons as much as i use to because theres always a problem i run into i came in after seeing great reviews about this place my nails always chip every week and im tired of having to repaint my nails twice a week i originally came in to put acrylic nails on which i was sort of dreading because in past nail salons ive been to they always heat up my nail with the electric tool they use i told the manicurist my reason for coming in and she suggested i do gel manicure ive never heard of it before but what they do is they give you a manicure and place a nail growth base polish and the gel on top which is healthier than getting acrylics this benefits me because my nail polish will last for weeks and my nails wont break because the gel is hard and makes it stronger that way i can grow out my nails as long as i would like without having to worry about breakage it costs but i think it was definitely worth it my manicurist is thuy shes great this place also sterilize their instruments my first visit to las vegas and on the way back from a day trip to the hoover dam decided i needed to have my nails done before dinner at encore checked yelp these folks had excellent reviews and i went for it please yelp dont let me down i begged wow excellent quality work super staff very clean this place was packed took the advice of an earlier poster and made an appointment was in the chair in less than mins was very expensive but was worth it thanks not knowing where to go for a good nail salon i checked yelp naturally and this place was highly recommended it was a little far from my house but it was worth the ride the place is super clean always puts me at ease when i walk into a place and its clean i had a nice old lady who didnt speak much english i got the spa pedicure with a french polish and i was very pleased with it the prices were really good and the service was good too i will definitely go back so happy i made an appointment to have my liquid gel full set fixed another place did an awful job i saw thuy and she did an amazing job and she was super quick i told her i had to be out by a certain time to pick up my daughter and she finished with a few extra minutes to spare super impressed with the team and great customer service ill definitely be going back and soon because i need a pedicure my experience started out bad but then turned out to be great let me start by saying that i received a gel mani and regular pedicure and they turned out great they have lots of gel colors to choose from and i found exactly what i was looking for now for the bad i made an appointment for me and my friend for pm and the receptionist asked if we could do later in the day because they were busy i said we could do pm at the latest but the receptionist said nevermind she would be able to get us in at pm we got seated for our pedicures around pm which i was actually impressed with because they were very busy however nobody came over to start working on my toes until pm nobody started working on my friend until pm i asked the manager if it was normal for an appointment to start minutes late and he explained that they were just really busy about minutes later two women came over and started giving us our manicures while our pedicures were finishing up which i greatly appreciated the lady doing my toes denise started talking to me and said whats the big deal about your appointment starting late youre getting your toes done now so oh well right i was furious to say the least i just blew it off and ignored her because the woman doing my nails ming was awesome very friendly and personable ultimately after paying our bill the manager met us outside and gave my friend and i a free lotion because of the wait i understand that things happen and mistakes are made and i applaud the manager for doing everything he could to make it right because of this i will be going back love coming here the guy who did my nails was really nice to my daughter which is something that i love i hate going place and feeling out casted because i have a child with me but the pedi could have been better if i have to pay more for a pedi that comes with a massage and the few other things i even get it done for then it better be done right and the massage better be more than a lotion rub down so for that i think it was over priced for what i got but ill go back because its close to home and the service wasnt completely terrible best pedicure ever found these guys on yelp and came here bc of all the great reviews im still sitting in the nail salon drying lol and i just had to write a review about this place i called ahead to see if they were busy and they said they were but to come right away and they would fit me in i was afraid i would get a crappy quick pedicure bc they were busy yet they took their time i wont go to another nail place in vegas again yay diamond nails you know its a legit salon when a guy gets a manipedi be completely comfotable lol tried this place out because of all the good reviews i tried out the deluxe pedicure and it was heaven for my feet and then at the very end the lady rubbed on something that cooled my feet and had a minty aroma ill definitely be back here when i get bored of my current nail color i found this salon on yelp and went for the first time on my birthday i got the deluxe jelly pedicure most amazing thing to feel on your feet this was my birthday treat and they were so awesome i bet i was there for about an hour and a half and did not have to wait at all to be seen they may be a little more pricey than their competitors with the special price banners all over the place but it is well worth it they even gave me a birthday present when i left as long as i live in vegas i will not go to another nail salon again when you find a small business offering stellar service support them this is the place to go if you want a gel manicure or a pedicure that lasts and lasts the whole staff is very friendly and they take their time the wait can be a little long if you walk in but the wait is worth it went a week ago for a hot stone massage pedicure the paint and design still looks great despite a week in flip flops the staff was friendly and professional ill definitely come back during future trips to vegas even if it is a little pricey i found this place because i was very unhappy with the previous nail salon i was going too i checked yelp and saw this place had excellent reviews ive yet to find a salon in vegas that is awesome so i figured id try them out i live in henderson so i definitely dont mind driving a bit for an excellent nail salon well let me tell you the experience was great from beginning to end when i called to make an appointment the lady was very friendly and nice that was definitely a good sign i arrived for appointment and everyone greeted me in a friendly manner there was a great vibe and the salon is super clean and relaxed i got the deluxe pedicure from wendy she has great attention to detail and did a great job on my french tip they were evenly done and feel oh so smooth while i was getting my pedicure done james helped me by soaking my gel nails off in tin foil he filed my nails while i was still getting my toes done i definitely felt pampered lol after i was done he finished my gel manicure his technique was so good i was definitely impressed he paid excellent attention to detail he made sure there was no mistakes they turned out excellent best gel manicure ive ever received fellow yelpers never lie i will definitely be back again i cant wait to try some of their other pedicures another great perk is their discounts they give they keep track of how many times you go there and on the th visit you get off there is also a points system that also gives rewards its super cool try this place out for sure thank god for yelp i was in las vegas and desperately needed a mani and pedi i have been the spas in the hotel for manipedi and even though you pay an arm and a leg i have never been wowd by their manicures or pedicures they are not awful but just not worth the money you pay for them so i decided to check out yelp and the reviews for diamond nails spa looked good so i thought i would try them out i was disappointed at all and totally worth the cab ride out there from my hotel on the strip they talked me into getting the gel manicure and i am so glad they did it looked fabulous and finally a manicure that doesnt chip as soon as you sneeze the wrong way i am a total believer in the gel manicure now and wish this place was in my home town so i could be a regular if in vegas this is the place to go for manipedi call ahead though it does get busy but it seems they always find a way to squeeze you in not your average neighborhood nail spa the hot stone pedicure is hands down the best pedi ive ever experienced two hot stones are used to massage your tired calf muscles and feet they even asked me if i would like a cold water and brought out a refreshing bottle of water the nail dryers are not standard issue they are uv lighted with fans my nails are dry in minutes flat fantastic eyelashes and facials by nicole first off i started with a facial nicole did a facial that was wonderful and then she also applied a pumpkin mask my face was glowing and radiant when i left the salon being a aged woman this really made my skin and neck smooth i also had the individual eyelashes done on my eyes and i love them they look so natural and are long and thick i do not need mascara with these and this was important to me i highly recommend seeing nicole for the individual eyelashes the facials and urge you to get the pumpkin mask as well the salon is very clean sanitary and a very pleasant place to have a spa day as i call it check out diamond nailslash lounge and see nicole im sad to rate this place because the more stars they get the more people will come but here goes i am from california and have high nail standards and i am happy to say this place lives up to it the pedicure menu alone is enough to keep a girl happy but then you see all the gel nail and colors they have to offer and you are hooked i strongly suggest an appointment or you will walk in a be sad when they turn you away they are always busy but still super clean in addition they have a wax lady that is great i have found my one stop shop and will be here every other week i have found my new nail salon i literally just left the salon but feel compelled to write a review because i cant stop looking at my gel mani theyre so effing cute i take partial credit for picking the cutest color known to man opi however jennys attention to detail and precision make this the best salon ive been to in las vegas for a gel mani is pretty standard from what ive heard everyone was super friendly the tools were all sterilized and their selection of gel colors is unparalleled thank you diamond nails i had indivdual eyelashes done on my eyes and am so happy with the resuts nicole did an excellent job and i cant say enough about what a great job she did i wore mascara occassionally in the past but i have not had to wear any with these lashes there is no reason to for me at least they look very natural and i have had compliments from friends and total strangers while i am out and about i have gone swimming and they look just as good coming out of the pool as going in nicole also did a wonderful facial on me that made my skin so radiant she recommended a pumpkin mask treatment which i gladly did and i was truly happy with the results i left the salon feeling like a whole new woman i highly recommend nicole for the eyelashes and facials she did an amazing job i took a chance as the review were all really good i had gone to this salon when it first opened by the previous owners i loved it then and now i am back to being a fan i had tried a couple of other placed in the meantime but thought i would check out and see how it is now i was looking for somewhere new to get my eyebrows done i generally dont like to have them done at a nail salon but saw they now have an esthetician available i called made an appointment and when i walked in nicole was ready and waiting she took the time to ask me what i wanted to have done as well as what i did not want to have done she was great she really listened and did a fabulous job it was worth the month wait i had given myself to grow my brows back out to fix what the last place i went to did thanks nicole looking forward to coming back in a few weeks for a touch up and hopefully a facial i will also be booking some me time for a much needed pedi and mani i love this nail salon they are super clean not your average nail shop they really pay attention to customer service and they are all so super nice i had james do my pink and whites and he did a fab job i will definetly come back you always get what you pay for so they might cost a little more than other places but well worth it this has to be the best pedicure ive ever had the ladies are very nice and run a smooth operation i had to wait a little while because they operate by appointments and i like the fact that i had to wait because this means they value their clientelle and they value time for me time is money and every minute i waste is throwing away money they have chocolate and champagne service as well had a great time here laughing with the ladies and knowing the the husbands that were there also think that real men take care of their feet let me start by saying i can see why this place has stars this is by far the best nail salon i have ever been to ive now been here twice im going to review it from both experiences i went here based off of all the great reviews i kept reading off of yelp most of the reviews said to make an appointment because the shops usually busy so i made an appointment and boy am i glad i did it was packed when i walked in i was surprised at how organized and clean the place is its not just some hole in the wall nail shop this is an actual salon i was greeted by the very friendly receptionist who had my appointment in the computer and i was immediately sat my nail stylist was kandy she st did my pedicure which i believe i got the deluxe it was dollars the massage and pedi was great the polish was ok i prefer my french to be thick but that wasnt her fault by the time i looked down it was to late to tell her ok now for the best part my nails i got a full set done brand new she did a fantastic job i showed her a pic from yelp it was a zebra design and she did black white and silver she did them exactly how i wanted them she was also very friendly and took her time even though the shop was past closing i couldnt stop looking at my nails by far the best nails ive ever had the whole bill came to including tip thats the most ive spent on nails but it was well worth it i believe you get what you pay for and id rather pay more and have gorgeous good quality nails my second experience was just as good as the st i dont remember the womens name who did them this time but she was just as good as kandy this time i got french with sparkles on top i had her cut them shorter and do them very square i heart square nails she did them exactly how i wanted i have no complaints and she was just as friendly as the rest of the staff after yrs in vegas trying to find a decent shop ive found my dream shop and i will only be coming here from now on what can i say yet another great experience here kandi did an amazing job again on my nails i will only go to her shes that good i didnt know what kinda design i wanted and she made one up for me and its by far my favorite nail design ive ever had if i could give this place more then stars i would best gel manicure in rockstar titanium by jessica figured im in vegas nancy is a great brow shaper too friendly staff im totally loving the glittery look tonight i decided to give diamond nails spa a try since it had a lot of great reviews and i am so glad i did james did both my gel extension manicure and deluxe gel pedicure yes it can be a bit pricey but at this place you get what you pay for james made sure i was pleased with my nails he took his time to make sure they were perfect i will definitely be returning my friend and i went in and we both got the chocolate and champagne pedicure and a manicure first things first everyone treated us with respect from the get go also as crazy as it may sound everyone spoke english to us and in front of us the staff is utterly amazing we had such a great time joking around with them outside of that the pedicure was awesome the hot stone message really makes it one of a kind we ended up doing gel on both our pedicure and manicure which came out wonderfully this is probably the first time i have ever been in awe of the way my pedicure came out i absolutely loved it they didnt try to rush us they listened to how we wanted our nails to look and because of that id have to say this has been my best experience in nail salon in vegas though it spent a bit more than i normally have in the past it was completely worth it i will surely be back i would suggest to make an appointment though every pedicure and manicure station was full almost the entire time we were there went here for the first time and i gotta say best service ive ever had in vegas definitely my favorite by far i am definitely a permanent satisfied customer very nice people and very thorough with their work worth every penny they make sure your happy with every thing id give them stars if that was an option i really like this place and the staff is pretty friendly they have a nice selection of gel nail color options which is really nice since i usually get gel manicures because im a cocktail waitress and a regular manicure will only last me a few days their gel manicure is a bit pricey but like i said they have great color options and all the gel ive gotten here has lasted me at least weeks some longer depending on the name brand the pedicures they offer are great as well my manicurist was friendly and careful not to nick me or cut me up with the nail clippers i hate when salons do that service took a while because they were busy but i also didnt make an appointment if i had i might have been more annoyed about how long everything took overall good friendly service prices are a tad high but so far the best manicure ive gotten in vegas i am still amazed by gel manicures this stuff just doesnt come off as you can probably tell i am a total noob when it comes to gel manicures but i am so glad that i went with that option my nails turned out beautifully i feel that the nail technicians here really do a good job she didnt cut my skin and was able to file my nails to the exact length and shape that i wanted while i had to wait for about minutes before i was treated i did not think it was a big deal at all especially since i had no made an appointment all in all my tab was great service they were quick but fantastic lots of gel colors not so much regular nail color choices but the price was good and they were very clean and friendly my first time getting my eyebrows waxed and getting a pedicure amazing experience being male getting this type of work done is so foreign to me but they made me feel extremely comfortable and i am very satisfied with the work they did nicole is fantastic patient and personable the product they use is light and flexible refills are not one price they are tailored to how much refilling you need i think thats pretty considerate cant wait to go back ehhh was just okay i went here because i was in vegas for work and needed a manipedi before a wedding the coming weekend read good things so i thought why not right had a deluxe pedi and shellac mani the scrub and massage with the pedi was great good selection of colors especially the gel options my paint just didnt last on either my toes were chipped by friday and i did this on a thursday night and my shellac manicure was cracked and peeling by saturday i was not wearing crazy shoes where my toes were getting stubbed or my nails were hitting things and i hadnt been swimming or soaked my hands in water i usually get weeks out of a gel manicure easily and atleast out of a pedi just disappointed very good experience went here because of the reviews on yelp and was not disappointed very friendly great service and my nails look amazing i am picky and she was really understanding and gave me exactly what i wanted did a full acrylic set with french manicure and i treated my two friends to a deluxe pedicure with minute reflexology not sure the reflexology was worth it but everything else was will definitely go again i just went to las vegas recently and this place is awesome they are soooo nice and sweet i wish i could move them to sacramento the place is super cutely decorated and really clean they are a tad pricy i paid for a gel manicure and i think for a pedicure but they did an amazing job my pedicure still hasnt chipped and i have had it on almost a month if you are looking for a place that does a great job and is clean then come here honestly i feel like everything in vegas is expensive so really its worth it to come here you will get your moneys worth the next time i head to vegas my first stop will be right here its clean the staff is friendly and boy do they know what theyre doing my gel manicure stayed beautiful for a month the best service came from nicole she is a miracle worker when it comes to lash extensions my lashes are still looking lush and long even after a month experienced and talented work clean shop sterilized tools and employees are friendly they keep up with the latest styles and products they are proud to tell you the names of the products they use i wouldnt go anywhere else i always leave happy and i am extremely pickey you should give them a try you wont be sorry trust me they also do waxing and eye lashes treat yourselt you deserve it i was visiting from san diego and found diamond nails on yelp the reviews were all so positive so i decided to try it out i called for an appointment and the woman who answered the phone was super friendly unfortunately i got lost trying to find the salon but when i finally did find it min later than my original appointment they quickly accommodated me and started my pedicure i chose the ice cream sunday pedicure which boasts an ice cream pop fizz bath bomb thats in the water tickling your toes and releasing minerals to revitalize your feet as the room fills with the aroma flavor you choose i chose pumpkin pie wonderful after a sugar scrub exfoliation a creamy marshmallow mud mask and body icing will make you feel like youve stepped into a giant fruit pie your toes glazes in a color of your choice look as good as new the lowest calorie dessert youll ever have but be careful youll want to go back for seconds the pedicure was exactly what i needed and exceeded expectations i had about the service if only there were a diamond nail salon in san diego i will say that anytime im in las vegas i will be sure to visit diamond nail salon because for the price and the service it beats any service offered by the exorbitant spas offered by the hotels on the strip this is a place i cant stay away from for some reason nail places are at every corner blocks near everyones house however like i said i choose this place over the closest or cheapest one near me it pricier compared to the usual but my nails always last so long afterwards they offer you watersoda always try to converse theres a new spa added to the company next door too it gets pretty busy so sometimes you may need an appointment everythings nice here youll get what you pay for i had a nail catastrophe i was so mad at how my acrylics looked from another salon and so tired of going to get them fixed up only to have the nail techs go over the lifted bits with acrylic and have it lift again within an hour i tried to pry them off and ended up with horrific thin nails and was close to crying so i yelped for a new salon and saw diamond they got me an appointment within an hour christy did my nails she was so friendly and didnt even lecture me about the damage i did to my nails trying to pry off the acrylics her nails were so adorable she had gel polish on that i had to have the same she convinced me by telling me that my nails were too pretty to cover with acrylic stop it christy go on haha she put hot towels on my poor hands and moisturized them and then applied coats of gel polish to make up for how thin and bendy they are then she made me promise not to take matters into my own hands nor to get nail damaging acrylics again they signed me up as a new customer to get off my th visit which is awesome is a lot of money to get a manicure i think but i also feel that its worth it for me to splurge every few weeks and let myself feel like royalty for an hour the gel polish will not chip or peel from what i understand which is very important since i work in a restaurant and thats very hard on polish i cant wait to try an ice cream pedicure i left feeling like a princess and cant wait for my next visit thanks for turning a nail catastrophe into a happy ending edit its been week and the gel polish has peeled on the ends of half of my nails with no fidgeting just from working ive been trying to be extra careful with them too kind of sad that i thought they would last longer after spending x what a normal manicure costs however after editing this review i got a call hour later from diamond asking me to come in and get my nails re done as they stand by their products and guarantee them thats customer service woohoo im here too often but they do such a wonderful job i would never even consider going elsewhere they are always accommodating and friendly bigger salons on the strip could learn a lot about service from the folks at diamond nails ive had multiple artists do my bi weekly gel manis all of them to an impeccable job quick service clean shop great work and the price is right you dont need an appointment as they work hard to fit everyone in and theyre open pretty late making the after work manicure possible ive never seen this place not busy but ive also never waited more than minutes for service you can tell they really care about the business and put a ton of pride into their work well done diamond nails i wanted to get a manicure pedicure done last minute with my gf and got an appointment within minutes we got there at and left by quan did my deluxe essential pedi rock star full set jamie did my gfs express pedi also rock star full set for the pedicure the tools were sterilized packaged quan did a good job fixing my tired feet the minty mask hot towel action was my favorite part i switched it up from my usual gel manicure to the acrylic stiletto style with gel i honestly havent pampered myself in a while so i was already assuming it was going to be the regular manicure cuticles cleaned hand massage etc quan did a great job with my nails was patient with me it took me a few minutes to pick out colors from the amazing selection of glittery gels they had i ended up doing a dark gray and a crystal white glitter on my ring fingers by the way my gf was visiting from chicago could not stop telling me how expensive it is in vegas woopsie she also did the stiletto with opposite colors with plain white gel a glittery black on the ring fingers i noticed on her nails probably because it was white that on a few of her nails the gel wasnt completely put on the side of her nails so it didnt look as nice my gf finished before me so once jamie finished my gfs nails she bounced my gf was trying to tip her but maybe she went home who knows the staff was nice the man who made our appointment over the phone rang us up was friendly printed out an extra copy of the receipts for me made small conversation and grandpa offered us bottled water i went here a few weeks ago for a regular manipedi i just moved to las vegas and have heard that everyone gets gel manicures and that regular manicures arent great here but im not a fan of gels i was a little nervous about the quality of the regular manicures since it seems everyone has gels but mai was awesome she did both my mani deluxe pedicure and was thorough and very friendlychatty the polish was perfect on my toes and had a beautiful gloss to them i was impressed with the quality of the pedicure and she did a fantastic job on my manicure as well filing my nails exactly how i asked her too square wrounded edges it was for both deluxe pedi mani the only negatives the polish selection wasnt great and i knew to bring my own polish just in case i noticed that many salons dont carry essie or opi which were staples in nyc nj glad i have a small collection of my fav colors and of the polishs that they salon did offer there werent very many colors and the display was completely disorganized it was hard to look at all the reds or pinks when they are all scattered on the display the other thing is that my polish chipped or rubbed off on my big toes within weeks thats never happened to me before but i have been wearing shoes wsocks so that could be it too i would definitely go back and see mai again the other thing i noticed was the smell of acetone or something else from the nail salon that was slightly overpowering they had the door open to air it out but i could still smell it i am months pregnant and if i was earlier in my pregnancy i wouldnt go back for that reason the decor was ok but i dont know that that really matters im from nycnj area where there are nail salons on every corner and all of them are either great or awesome and the prices are actually less than vegas so i was hoping for good service here in vegas but wasnt holding my breath diamond nails was great and i was pleasantly surprised the only thing that i noticed about lv nail salons is how expensive a regular manicure is in most salons and lacking in selection of quality polish and colors nyc will run at most for a mani with essie opi in every single color but i guess that is how it is here star service new and clean equipment with superb business practices these people know what they are doing and pay ultimate attention to detail i usually get gel for both manipedi flawless is the word from the moment you walk out of the salon till at east weeks later no awkward moments bottled water awesome massage id recommend james and christy soooo happy there is a reliable place to look forward to thanks diamond nails christy did a fantastic job from beginning to end im new to las vegas and was struggling finding a decent nail salon but now i dont need to look anymore will definitely be back again i went my wife to go get her nails done and was ordered by her to get a pedicure and a manicure i was against it from the start after all i thought this stuff is just for women i was surprised to see and feel a big difference it made to my hands and feet and it wasnt girly at all i actually got compliments on my feet about how clean they look im very impressed with the salon and funny thing is now i noticed other men there doing the same thing definitely recommending this place to everyone my husband and i both went in to get a pedicure we both decided to get the hot stone pedicure and it was great my husband has some pretty intense feet theyre dry cracked and his nails well i call them alligator claws lets leave it at that but the lady doing his feet really made them look normal again of course she had to get out the drimmel and file down his nails but still the massage was great i could have sat there for hours both workers were nice and talked to us which is different from a lot of nail salons ive been to definitely the place to go to get your nails done lost my potential business because they couldnt bother to answer the phone during business hours so i could make an appointment or ask if they offered the particular service i was looking for they also dont have an informative voicemail message to let you know their hours if they were closed that day or even if i called the right number if you cant even take the time to answer the phone or record a simple voicemail message than i wont waste my time hoping i can get in for a service im not even sure you provide i have been to diamond nails only a handful of times im usually waaayy to busy to even get a manipedi in for myself but after only the second time of going they were always attentive enough to remember my name and call me by it whether i made an appointment or just walked in i think its one of the smallest ways to show great customer service and always makes me feel welcome and important in their busy day even if on a small scale usually i just get your run of the mill manipedi and my nails always look great one an occasion or two ive asked for a somewhat fancytrendy polish job designs that required hand painting multi color polish on different nails and theyve accommodated my request every time with a smile in fact theyve made it fun some salons act like youre in inconvenience of a lifetime if my assigned technician cant do what ive asked theyre honest and upfront and always take the time and initiative to ask all the technicians if they can do it before saying no which theyve never said and everyone comes over and checks out the progress of my designs talk about service with a smile after having my nails outlined in thin hot pink polish by my awesome technician she did an incredible job too the lines were perfectly sized and even all the way around my tiny nails i went to the dryers where i completely ran wet fingers into the dryer itself and completely ruined all three nails mortified at what i did completely my fault i reluctantly went back to her and with just a small giggle she told me to sit down and fixed all three with no problem at all it took her min to do each hand and i felt awful and then helped me to the dryer again if i were her i probably would have thrown my hands up and ran away from me at that point but she did no such thing a customer service all the way winnie did my nails this past time just a regular mani no crazy nail designs and she was great i was last of my party of three to shit down and first one done she was so nice very fast and thorough i got a great hand massage that wasnt the slightest bit rushed annd she did coats of polish and my nails look great love the shape of them the polish is even and shiny she did a great job the salon is clean quiet i hate when technicians chitter chatter across the place like theyre the only ones there everyone here is more interested in talking to you then to their coworkers and all their instruments are newly packaged cant wait to be back i used to live right across from this nail shop and stopped in quite often the staff is friendly and the lady that does facials is great i no longer live in vegas but if i i back and need nail service this is where i would go the only place i go to in vegas even though i live by the strip lots of parking outside and tons of aloha inside this place is beautiful and tranquil nicest people youll ever meet my boyfriend lives in the area and i wanted to get my nails done early in the morning which is perfect because diamond nails is open at am unlike most am salons came right in at am and got christy i came looking to try gel nails as i have brittlethin nails loved the nude colors they had and christy was a pleasure to talk to and did a great job and even though the nail color changed within weeks prolly because of what i put on my hands makeup lotion etcetc i wasnt too mad at it bcuz the manicure itself still looked great weeks later christy wound up doing my french gel mani my nd time back at diamond nails i loved them after my french tip gel mani i was pretty much over gel nails bcuz i hated the way it looked after the grow out went back hoping to get christy again but got someone else i wish i got her name because she was a great nail tech as well after telling her that i wanted to get rid of the gel she recommended i get oval nails ive never wanted nor thought of getting any shape nails other than square but she said my nail shape went with oval so i went with it and i have never loved my nails more they look longer and i just love it they also went with the whole stiletto nail fad without being scary stilettos today was my second time to diamond nails on s rainbow the second i walked in he door i felt like a vip the owner was at the front showed me pictures of some really cool nail designes made a few pedicure suggestions was all around a really nice and helpful man christy did my nails gel fade helped me pick colors we had good conversation while getting my nails done i was getting a pedicure at the same time it was fast they did a great job and most importantly it was clean i will definatly be going back and would highly reccommend this nail salon to others ps they were cheaper and friendlier than other nail salonds in the immediate area i didnt have to call and be put on hold for minutes to be told that they wouldnt have any openings for a week no cancellation fees love love love it i found this salon online prior to coming to vegas and my girlfriend and i decided to come here based on the reviews we had read this was our first stop as soon as we arrived in vegas we loved this place the salon was clean staff was friendly and the services were phenomenal highly recommend this salon first time going here and check in process was very short i did not have to wait i was directed right away i got my nails done and i did a fade frenchgel manicure and got my eyebrows waxed the lady who did my nails did a wonderful job she was very patient with my decisions on my nails and she helped me decide what to do with them im very indecisive so she helped me by showing me pictures and samples of nail designs overall great service and i will be a returning customer love love love this place came here w my bff found it on yelp service was fantastic above and beyond not only did they do a great mani pedi for my friends but they also gave me a vip room w blanket an awesome bed to rest in and tv while i was waiting the manager even offered to feed my fruit ha love love love this place i woulda given it stars if it was possible loved the friendly staff the feast service and my nails i will be going back again if you have no idea where to go i definitely recommend this place im so glad i found this place i keep coming back the service is excellent sometimes i want to be pampered and dont want to talk other times im a chatty cathy either way they seem to take my lead and follow i always get the same thing a spa french pedicure they soak your feet clean your toes massage your legs and put some wonderful smelling products on you stacy is the best i have her do my pedis shes super friendly and does a great job i recently got gel nails or maybe acrylic ones i dont know the fake ones they look great and the last set lasted over weeks again i get the french manicure goes with everything no matter what you are wearing christie did the nails and she does a great job the place is always super clean but i still bring my own tools for the pedicure stacy always sanitizes it for me too i highly recommend this place oh and my last visit i got off because every visits they treat you to a discount love it never have i ever been to a nail salon where i have an actual conversation with the tech beyond the normal hi how are yas this place is the complete opposite for that im in love ive been frequenting diamond nails for about months now seeing thuy exclusively from the moment i walk in i am greeted by my name prior to signing in which shows they truly care about repeat business i go for the standard gel mani and they last for the full weeks i have only had an issue with the opi line not staying on but they have more than enough colors gel lines to choose from that it does not even matter make sure make an appointment as this place gets packed another good thing is no matter how many people are waiting they will always make sure everyone is taken care of and you are not rushed i have never once seen anyone be turned away even when they are almost closing sam thuy big thanks for being not only wonderful people but great business owners i enjoy getting my nails done but hadnt been able to find a nail salon that felt like home so i had pretty much given up and my nails were looking neglected i decided to take my sister out as a treat for her birthday to get our nails done i had been to a bigger fancier establishment down the street previously and had been disappointed in the attitude i encountered so i looked to yelp for a new place to try seeing the great reviews we gave it a shot given that this was a last minute decision to get our nails done we didnt have appointments we went in and the receptionist i wish i had gotten her name was fantastic she greeted us kindly told us it wasnt a problem that we didnt have appointments and quickly got us in they were busy but still made time for us neither of us felt they rushed if anything i felt they took extra time to make sure my nails were perfect and to my satisfaction i wanted to get a pedicure as well but due to my own time constraints will have to go back soon i highly recommend diamond nails everybody was very friendly spoke to us by name paid attention to what we were looking for and in the end our nails both looked fantastic their pricing was also very reasonable i will definitely be back possibly later this week for that pedi i highly recommend this nail salon to anybody who has had their confidence in the industry crushed nobody seemed stuck up or above everybody else and it just felt like a very inviting and friendly atmosphere my feet were in need of some serious attention i waddled in as a walk in im months pregnant and immediately was seated and helped by quan amazing my scaly hooves were transformed into silky balls of butter the soak exfoliation and massage were just what my tired tootsies needed i chose the spunkiest hottest pink polish i could find i had the deluxe pedicure which was priced at but then i was upsold so he could use a new product line it was worth it clean friendly atmosphere and i wasnt pressured into idle chit chat which was awesome because then i could focus on the pampering i highly recommend diamond nails and will definitely be back very soon came for my birthday and it was very relaxing i got the deluxe pedicure and jessica did a really great job highly recommend finally i made it to the promised land despite the min two freeway drive from my afb area i still decided quality trumped distance i walked in at about ish on a sunday afternoon and jenny took care of me i got a full set of stiletto nails a deluxe pedi and someone else did my eyebrows well i guess is should say fixed them its a long story any who my deluxe pedi was great only down fall is i kind of like my water scorching hot but i took it warm because i didnt want to burn the nail tech other than that jenny was amazing she went and chose my polish based on what i told her i wanted im still a nail newbie so i didnt know to chose my polish i then got my stiletto nails i have been wanting the pointy witch nail forever i am a mother of with a bun baking so i couldnt have them super long they came out everything i wanted and more especially being that i am not the most artistic person but i love nail arts and sparkle jenny hit my simple yet very cute design right on the head this salon is very clean and everyone is friendly jenny is great she is there days a week i highly recommend her and diamond spa ok ive found my nail salon in vegas finally diamond nails does shellac manicures one of the few who dont confuse shellac with gel james did my shellac manicure and regular pedicure and did a great job everyone in the salon is helpful and knowledgeable asking if you want water if youre comfortable etc i felt very comfortable as soon as i got there i will be back next time i need a manicure pedicure or any of the many services they offer prices were pretty much average for what i had done they took care of me right away and i got great service by people who know what theyre doing what more could i ask great find first off let me say im from northern canada here on holidays and found this spa online based upon prior clientele reviews and the pleasant response on the phone when i called i chose to drive a hr to give it a whirl i chose it partially based on the reviews and truly believe reviewing helps you as well as others bar none this is the best spa i have been to in years the staff is courteous and friendly and very attentive i called ahead just to inquire and was treated very well upon arriving as a walk in later that evening i was seated in a massage chair for my pedicure and offered a bottle of water from the moment christy sat down to start my pedicure i knew this spa was a keeper the pedicure was soothing and my feet feel and look amazing after my pedicure i moved to a table for my gel manicure christy is chatty without being nosy and is fun to talk to her attention to detail was very comforting in that i knew i was getting my monies worth which is a very big deal to me i told her what i wanted done and she happily gave me exactly what i envisioned my nails look amazing and i cannot sing enough praise about christys work ethic as it was a full hour after closing when i walked out everyone staff members left in the spa was still pleasant and very courteous despite the late hour i have tried many spas and not had even a fraction of the quality for a lot more money this is a repeat for me yearly when we are in town for the nascar race at las vegas motor speedway thank you and i look forward to seeing christy again ps the hot tip on a great place for pizza was dead on grimaldys was awesome and my ever patient hubby was grateful first impression was on the phone and the man i spoke to was very nice i made an appointment with no problem and when i walked in signed in i didnt have to wait at all they actually honor appointment times which i love because some places ive been to dont denise did my eyebrows and she did a good job a little uneven but i can deal with it it isnt that noticeable she was very nice as well and talked to me the whole time which i liked normally its just quiet maybe with a couple oh you have a lot of hair comments im italian give me a break lol valerie did my nails and she was also very nice we talked about a lot of different things and i also welcomed that because sometimes its silent with the nail technicans too i had a full set done and showed her a specific design i wanted on my ring fingers the design she did doesnt look like what i wanted but i like what she did better it isnt perfect but i wasnt going to have her re do it or anything like i said i like it better what i like is often different than everyone else and im totally fine with that so as usual i have something that isnt the norm and i love it a downfall though was their phone system went down which also meant their credit card machine did i had cash for the tip which i had already given denise and valerie but i had to go to an atm down the street to get cash to pay for what i had done he was apologetic for it and of course i didnt get mad or anything its not like they were out to inconvenience me like that just sucks that it happened when i was in such a hurry to get somewhere so all in all i enjoyed my visit i will be back i like that they have a customer loyalty program as well i believe its after visits you get a discount i finally found my vegas nail shop after two failed attempts at a perfect pink and white fill in diamond nails finally made me complete the shape was perfect and my nails look immaculate i even got a french pedi i got the step up above the express dont remember what it was called but my toes felt fresh and pepperminty afterwards for hours the entire staff is friendly attentive and took care of everyone very packed when i made my appointment to come in at pm on a friday great service nonetheless also the store is much much cleaner larger and updated than your typical nail shop very worth the extra minute drive i loved my nails after christy did them i had gels done before by a different salon that completely neglected my cuticles didnt even push them down also the gels done by this other place started peeling almost immediately christy totally pampered my hands putting them in some moisturizing mittens before even starting this girl is hilarious and i can see why she is so busy even on weekdays in the middle of the day so my short nails look amazing in a perfect french manicure thanks diamond nail i already have my next appointment had a pedi with the nuskin treatment because the bf said so my feet were soooo bad like dragon scale bad and my friend stepped on my toe so my nail was messed up jenny fixed all of that she didnt need to use a crazy tool either she was patient and exfoliated with a pumice like crazy then massaged my feet i think they did a wonderful job i didnt opt for the gel pedi because that would of cost an extra on top of the or so that i was dropping it costs so much to get your nails done in this town toe nails are now sandal ready feet skin are now smooth like a babys bottom been going there now for over a year and james rocks it everytime call and schedule if you can he books up well in advance love love love this place i was so excited about trying this place i have gone to like salons since ive been in vegas and i thought this was the one because of all the great reviews so i had an appt on sat and went in at am so i got a full set and its been two days since ive been there and they are lifting already im sooo disappointed well i received a call from a very nice gentlemen telling me he would fix my nails since they want the customer to be happy i never had any other nail place do this i thought that was awesome so i went in and he was super nice and he fixed my nails know they look great thanks diamond nails im a happy customer i loved this place i love the atmosphere and the people i had jenny and she was great would definitely recommend this place very clean and everyone is super friendly a friend and i went here on a busy sunday afternoon they offered us bottled water andor tea and they were okay with us showing up minutes late for our appointment we both got the french tips gel manicure both of ours turned out great the quality of the gel is great and the price was reasonable my friend got the express pedicure and also got french tips for her feet i payed a little extra for the deluxe pedicure which was very much needed for my feet the deluxe pedicure included deep exfoliation on my soles massage of my legs and foot with a citrus scrub they applied a mint like mask and put hot towels on my feet and finished it off with lotion and polish overall happy with my experience just make sure you call in advance to book an appointment after not getting my gels done in nearly a month i finally had time to pop in before work before i even sat down i had many ideas of nail designs running through my head asked james if he could do an easterpastel colored ombre on me showed him of what i was thinking and he said thats easy he proceeded to show me an ombre design he did a few days prior and it was exactly what i was looking for after no later than an hour i got my yellowgreenblue ombre nails and i couldnt have been happier james took his time and was very pleasant and fun to talk with i think ive found my new favorite nail tech here that makes nail techs for me to choose from im very happy about that after reading the reviews on yelp i was expecting star service but is all i can give them star is for taking me as a walk in after i had called to see if they were bz and they were the nd star is for the water they gave as u sat for your pedicure the rd star is for doing a decent job on my toes even though the girl did not do a great job it was passable i subtracted star for rushing through my pedicure the girl next to me got the cheaper pedi and they started on her before me and finished after me i paid the extra for the hot stone pedi because i wanted the extra long massage as my feet and legs needed some tlc trust me it was not worth it like i said the girl next to me for the cheaper pedi and got a massage that lasted longer then mine the nd star was taken away for the receptionist telling the girl working on me that she had another pedi waiting and making the motion to hurry and finish me off so the girl could get started on the next person this was not the best service nor the best pedi i have ever gotten i was disappointed after all the great reviews i will not be returning too many other nail salons around to pay for a passable pedi not worth it in my book omg i absolutely love this place to death i got a beautiful full set done by the amazing winnie today ive never had acrylics done so this was my first time and winnie did an amazing job at free handing my flower design all i have to say is that im definitely coming back here to get my nails done again and i know i wont be disappointed the staff is incredibly friendly they apologized for the mix up accommodated me and took care of me for having to wait i really appreciated that i came the day after tough mudder and trinh was amazing i didnt forget the h she made sure she didnt hurt me painted slow and precise and has a fantastic personality i will be back i will be loyal this place is definitely my spot in lv for nailstoes thank you trinh your tiger stripes are a maze im not much of a reviewer but this particular experience ive recently had with a tech at this salon was so bad that i decided to write a review forgive me if this rant turns into an essay i have been to diamond nails a few times now all my previous experiences were not the most impressive but did fulfill my expectations id say stars previous to this experience so pretty good pleasant customer service and pretty decent nail designs to be fair i have been accustomed to great nail salons in california before i came back to vegas i went in after a strenuous week looking to wind down with some relaxing mani pedi i had an appointment but ran late and was assigned to a random tech i think named yuki that was fine since i never had a favorite and went to different techs everytime i visited never was a problem before i went in with a sample picture of a nail art i wanted to get done it was a rather unusual nail art with reversed light pink gradation with clear tips i knew it might be difficult to portray the same effect but the result i got was nowhere close there were ultimately things that made me extremely frustrated and upset lack of technical ability the gradationfade of the color was nothing like a real gradation just a two chunky and irregular separation of the clear and the pink i tried making a few side comments to help her understand how i wanted it but it didnt work i was even going to just let it go assuming that this nail art is just too difficult to copy i didnt even bother asking for the d design shown on the index finger of the sample picture because i was aware of the available stock of d accessories for the pinky i asked for a gradation of the gold glitter instead of the full nail so i can keep the look longer i have had nail art done many times before in various designs but never had i had a tech apply only a single coat of a glitter claiming that multiple coats would ruin the fade effect and make it too bulky towards the end she even had the audacity to comment on how pretty it looked was she joking i couldnt believe she said that when my discontentment was probably evident the whole thing just looked worse than if i had done them myself all my friends and even my mother commented on how terrible my nails look and to think that i paid in full for this mess what a disaster to her credit the regularexpress pedicure was just okay attitude when i discovered nasty little black dust particles very visibly sealed into my gel nails on quite a few of them she kept pretending not to see them this was ridiculous because i have never had this happen before in my entire years of nail art history when i told her that i obviously wanted to get the dust particles removed she kept arguing that the dust particles were so small that others wouldnt notice and it probably came from the sponge that she used to create the so called gradation effect isnt it a priority to remove the problem rather than to assign an excuse for it i also noted her half hearted whimsical hand massage at the end of the manicure i ended up complaining to the management the girl and the guy usually by the cashier because i wasnt getting anything through yuki all they did was to call her back and ask what had happened no apologies then she proceeded to tell me to take a seat again with an irritated expression she attempted to redo the few nails and all she did was apply an extra coat of the gradation which just made the color separation worse when i tried to point out exactly what was wrong she kept saying in an irritated tone what do you want me to do just unbelievable i eventually gave up and sat there quietly all in all i ended up getting my nails re done during my trip to california shortly after i dont know if she was having an off day but there is absolutely no excuse to behave like that in a service industry such as this even though i expected more from the management in reparation for this issue due to the salons stellar reviews on yelp diamond nail salon is alright i will probably go back but this time ill be sure to make an appointment with a specific tech with some good rep i would rather leave and come back another time than go to that tech again you all have been warned friendly got me in right on time and my manicure was great salon was nice and clean i highly recommend my go to nail salon in vegas clean environment happy helpful staff and great gel manicures as suggested by one of the staff i tried the asian ballerina tea and that works like a charm sparkle on friends i am giving stars because i told my technician i would in all honesty i would probably rate my experience a but my technician sam was so great i do not mind rounding up it was not the most mind blowing pedicure i have ever had but it wasnt unpleasant or anything he even recommended a cream to make my feet softer yes i did say he sam was hilarious and kept me entertained the entire time plus he did not rush my pedicure which is a pet peeve of mine and took his time i did have to wait a little bit to receive my services but that was as a walk in the wait is definately worth it i am glad i read the reviews and tried this place i will definately be back whenever i am in the area love this nail salon they are friendly and their work actually lasts try the hot stone massage it is amazing i love this place i used to be very particular about the exact person that would work on my nails but i have been going to diamond nails and found that almost every nail tech here is amazing this place does very well so make sure to call and make an appointment or prepare to wait for a little bit if you visit as a walk in i was so not impressed at all with my visit to diamond nails i went to get a fill and pedicure days ago and my nails are already lifting the pedicure was really rushed and my feet look like i didnt even have now toes nails are already chipping and the bottom of my feet look they werent even touched i gave them a so they rating will go down stars nails on durango and windmill get stars this place is super busy but its not quality at all i have been getting my nails and toes done every weeks since i was i know quality shame on diamond nails i used to get quick pedicures in california but they were half the price day and my feet hurt the bottoms are cracking i could of done my own pedicure better then wendy i dont regularly get a mani pedi but ive only had a good experience whenever i get them at diamond nails spa the ladies that did my nails have been cute and friendly never used to like chatter at salons love getting the gel mani with the french tips pricey at around but it lasts me for a couple of weeks i would suggest getting a clear gel with colored or glittered tips this is a better transition if your lazy with the upkeep like me for my feet ive only tried the express pedicure which is nice for what i love best about diamond nails is their willingness to make time for me their hours are very convenient and they have a large staff they are very nice too i have enjoyed having my toes done at this nail salon for the past two years this update and star rating goes towards the impressive management they have at the salon within hours of writing the previous review on yelp i was quite surprised to be contacted by the owner who offered me an apology as well as a free service for my horrid nail job it was unexpected as i had previously left the salon with dissatisfaction despite my complaint to the management because i had been out of state for a few weeks it took me a while to go back still they honored their offer and jamie helped our nails look great the deluxe and express pedis my mother and i each got with different technicians were satisfactory as well with their new renovationextension of the salon i assume the place will be able to handle larger clientele with more efficiency all the more reason to go back for me now it seems that the previous tech ive been to still works at the place but no matter i am now convinced of their great customer service and jamie was awesome this will be my go to place in vegas at least for a while and did i mention that i have to drive minutes to get service at this place let me first say ive been getting my nails done for the past years therefore i know nails i just moved from centennial hills to southwest and needed to find a new nail salon seeing all the great reviews diamond nails got i figured why not i made an appt for that same day and when i arrived my appt started right on time even though the place was packed they get star for being very prompt cindy was my nail tech and i got a pedicure first then a full set when i chose my color for my toes cindy kept questioning it i picked it it is for my toes why does she care what color is on my toes pedicure was decent i got the upgraded pedicure and it was just average nothing to rave about when i chose my color for my nails i got the same grief from her saying another color would look better and the color i chose was not pretty that wasnt even a big deal for me at the time just figured she was trying to help a girl out after my nails were done everything looked fine and i was a satisfied customer day after my brand new full set my acrylics were already lifting and my pedicure had already chipped it has been days since my full set and every single one of my nails had lifted and had broken normally i go weeks in between nail fills i had to go get a fill today because they looked so horrendous that is barely a week after my full set i have never had such badly done nails in my life i do not know about the other nail technicians maybe they are star material but i will never go back to diamond nails jenny at diamond nails is a gem my gel no chip manicure lasted three weeks and was worth every penny she takes her time and never rushes and is just a really nice lady even though i live minutes from this salon the trip is well worth it ive been going to diamond nails for more than a year now everyone is so nice from the minute you walk in the door until you leave since i started getting gel manicures my nails have never looked better going weeks between appointments without chips is amazing the techs are all very nice and professional they are friendly and polite too i am blessed with good nails but ive seen the job they do on ladies without not so good nails everything is very very clean all tools are brought to the station in a sealed package and the finished quality of my manicure has been perfect every time thanks to everyone at diamond nails i have been going to diamond nails for the past year to have my nails done they are very professional and courteous at every visit i have been very happy with the treatments on my nails ive been here about times and they still treat me like its my first time there i was seeing the same girl regularly who always did a fantastic job and was so fun to chat with ever since she quit ive had bad experience after bad experience they dont file my nails evenly they leave left over polish all over my fingers and give me attitude when i ask them to remove it they cut me with the filer and grinder and their nail polish is so thick that it doesnt even dry after two rounds under the fan ive ran out of chances to give them i get much better service and treatment at polished one block away omg i freaking love this place it was my first time coming in everyone was nice accommodating by the way i live minutes away it was sooo worth the drive i received the hot stone foot massage which was out of this world im months pregnant after a long day of working standing it was so relaxing i also got a gel manicure that was unlike any other i had before pretty much to sum it up the employees take the time to make you feel good get your worth it is my new home fantastic service everyone there was laughing and having a great time christy was my nail technician and she was great she took her time with everything made great conversation and helped me make the difficult choices of nail color and pattern i got both a pedi and mani and they were fantastic the other nail place i used to go to messed up my my nails so many times but this place is right on the dot great options at affordable prices only for gel mani and deluxe pedi definitely recommend im really bummed about this review id read all the great reviews on yelp and after trying a few other nail places around town i was really hoping this would be my new go to for acrylics valerie was super sweet the salon was crazy clean and i was impressed with the salon overall i had explained to val that it was really important to me to be careful with acrylic near the cuticles because my nails tend to lift when they grow out the nail lady i had in so cal before moving to vegas was awesome and i never had any lifting she explained this secret to me when she finished i was pretty happy with my nails until two days later when one of my nails completely popped off no pulling up or slow peeling just popped off ugh so i went and got my nail fixed at a salon near my house then two days after that as im getting ready to go out for the night another nail pops totally off seriously just days after my new full set this is no bueno now a week after my appointment over half my nails are lifting super bummer i think ill go back to the salon and try a different nail tech again valerie was super sweet and probably does a great job with other people but these nails need a little more tlc im still giving stars because everything else there was great and you can book appointments online i found this place on yelp at the best rated and let me tell you im so glad i did im a faithful follower for life i always go with christy shes an efficient perfectionist her gel skills are amazing i can go on and on so ill just stop and say come to this place and you wont be disappointed great service and employees with an awesome sense of humor got my friend and i right in and did great on our pedicures also gave a good discount for first time customers love this place my friend took me to this salon so i thought it would be great but unfortunately i did not enjoy my time or services there we went in and had reservations but we had to wait a little while when we finally got seated i thought they would start on our pedicure but again it took them awhile to get to us and this place wasnt even that busy i ordered the deluxe essential pedicure asked to remove my shellac i liked the way they removed my shellac it was different from all the other salons that ive been to each finger was wrapped in foil however they left it on for too long because my fingers started to burn when i told the guy to remove it he told me that since its a shellac it needs to be soaked in longer well when they finally took off the foil it looked like my cuticles burned off it was terrible my fingers were all red and sore my pedicure wasnt great either it was supposed to be the deluxe that included the massage but the massage on my legs were terrible it was not relaxing and he kept making me use the massage option on the chair i would tell him that i dont need it but he kept turning it on full blast he cut my nails way too short and when i looked at my feet the paintjob was terrible some of my toes were darker than others and the paint chipped off in days when i get a pedicure i can keep it nice for at least weeks but for this place it was done in days so i just took it off this place was a rip off i paid close to to remove my polish and get my pedicure they have a lovely atmosphere reasonable prices and sweet workers however they did use some weird base underneath my light nail polish that left them yellowish orange kind of unhappy about that the only nail shop i go to in vegas christy is by far my favorite she is so sweet and nice she is quick and does an amazing job do not get turned off by this place by some of the reviews because there are or people there that are not that good i had one nail tech complete destroy nails and i was turned off but i decide to give this place one more time and got christy and never looked back james is pretty good to i havent had him myself but i have seen his work im alway surprised to see a negative review i have been to many salons since i moved to vegas and by far this has been the best occasionally there is a wait because someone has asked for extra stuff but christy is well worth the wait she is funny as she works but does not waste time she knows me well enough now she tells me what colors i will like and not like and never steers me wrong if there is a long wait someone else will wrap my nails i have gel so when i get to her it does go faster and she makes up the time bottles of water are always available i do suggest getting an appointment and going during the week if possible weekends tend to be super busy james is amazing the quality of his work is outstanding leading to the best gel set and pedicure i have ever had i only gave stars because i had scheduled a wedding party with two other ladies that all were split up even though i had asked for us to be together this will absolutely be my go to nail place from now on ive tried a lot of nail salons since moving to this side of town and while there were a few that i enjoyed none of the experiences were as good as the one i had today i went in looking to find someone to do great nail art and i found it in christy shes hilarious and extremely talented at what she does most places will give you the bare minimum of conversation but not here i had a good time from the time i walked in the door until i left like i said will be going here from now on and will try to bring my friends i went to diamond nails after my original nail salon lost my favorite nail artist this was my first time here and james was amazing he did a complex tribal design on my nails with gel and took the time to perfect every detail he didnt rush and did it perfect i officially found my new nail salon and will be sure to book with james every time hes super talented always clean and fast every time ive gone christy did my nails this last time did a great job and we had a great conversation the whole time i will be returning thank you christy for helping me just returned from a girls weekend in vegas my daughter found this location via yelp for a group of to get pedicures we had adults teen and pre teen the location is just south of vegas not far to get to and easy to find the locations is clean and nice all the staff was friendly and helpful we were taken right back as we made reservations to assure the of us could sit side by side the younger girls had the deluxe pedis and my daughter and i had the stone pedicures we were all very pleased with the ladies who worked on each of us it took between minutes to an hour i had a bad big toe toe nail as it is growing out from an injury and my nail tech suggested putting acrylic on it while it finished growing back great suggestion i got it done i would recommend anyone looking for a place off the busy crowd and noise of the strip to relax and get an inexpensive pedicure this is your place love this place my nails had an amazing design and lasted weeks will be back for sure love this place made an apt at pm with jenny who was on time brought a pic of how i wanted my nails done and she made it exactly to the pic the salon closed at pm she was done with my full set at pm and stayed overtime to do a pedicure thank you so much jenny saw the reviews and decided to check it out i absolutely love it the service there is great they constantly are offering water and making sure your comfortable the lady that did my nails was very nice and really made sure that i liked my nails definitely found my nails place my nail girl moved back east in may and ive been searching las vegas for a new hook up needless to say its been frustrating i tried another salon after extensive yelping but i was very unhappy with the customer service i jumped on yelp again and thought id give diamond nails a try i booked the appointment online full set and got a confirmation text and e mail almost immediately that my request had been submitted i then got another text stating that the tech id wanted christy was not available and could i call and re schedule i called right away and they were very apologetic and scheduled the appointment for thursday the salon was extremely clean and very busy christy was running a little late but the receptionist and christy apologized twice she was only minutes late but i appreciated the acknowledgement i explained what i wanted and showed christy some pictures i did not want anything fancy but i am particular about the shape and thickness of my acrylics she was quick efficient and very personable i love my nails and will definitely be back my girlfriend booked an appointment to get pedicures at diamond nails spa via yelp recommendations we were able to get pedi chairs next to each other and chat they offered us cold drinks water but i heard that champagne was available too i had a guy do my pedicure and overall was happy with my pedi express before leaving i noticed he left some polish residue on my big toe so the owner took care of it and fixed it right up my friend was also happy with her pedi overall service was spot on place was tidy prices are reasonable and the owner knows how to make his customers happy i wish this place was in the sf bay area i got a pedicure gel manicure both were done flawlessly went with a gf she loved here too shes now a regular i live out of state i have never complained in my life until now ill make it as short as possible walked in and showed them what i wanted on my nails and toes and only had x amount of time said they could do it and started on my pedicure after pedicure they tell me they dont have the striping to match my nails so i get irritated that i already matched my toes to what they said they could do well figure out another way to do the striping so we start shaping and filling my nails and she tells me the colors i picked arent what they really are and they dont have them picked new ones even more irritated as im getting this done m trying to vocalize what i wanted fixed or done and she tells me to stop telling her what to do and just let her do it so at this point im over halfway through and pissed finally wiping off the gel at the end with alcohol and spills it all over my new phone and slides it over and just continues i immediately grab it and try to wipe it all off asap that was it because i looked at the time and i was now there way longer than i was told and messed up my entire schedule couldve told me before anything was started that they were unable to do them but just had to take my business i guess what i wante is on the eft and what i got is on the right see for yourself never going back save yourself the time and go across the street to polished like i did immediately to redo diamonds messup paid for an express pedi which was basically a repaint with added cuticle cut thats it and these nails mind you it was a fill not full set adding pic asap the one with the different whitebluelightblue pattern with silver striping the technique use hour to finish my nail i have never had to wait so long for got a pedicure for the color in my pedicure i still had to go home and fill them up a bit also they dont care about customer i will never go back here luv it very friendly many choices of color gotta try the pedicure treatments brought the wife here to get her fancy for our weekend in vegas reviews were good so we have it a shot she wasnt used to some if their techniques it seemed but they worked miracles and wonders she loved her mani pedi and they looked great in the new pumps i just bought her but gentlemen if you happen to take your woman here and youre sitting and waiting for the misses to get done youre missing out on something special look around for carmelita shell give you an amazing massage while you wait sometimes complimentary so dont forget to tip this amazing goddess of all things massage simply because of her alone i wouldnt dare let my lady get her nails done anywhere else great place another star review for christy this was my third appointment with her and im hooked she gave me football themed nail art and i could not be happier i was getting married on the weekend and needed a place to get my nails done since i broke one of my nail while trying to open a stubborn window now before i start my review i must say that this was the first time i have ever gotten my nails done and boy is it expensive this is what i got done and the pricing deluxe essential pedicure gel polish french gel manicure french design added the tip and the whole thing came out to be ouch is this how much stuff normally cost so anyways the experience itself was interesting i made an appointment at pm but they were able to take me an hour earlier since i got there early didnt have a problem conversing with amy the lady that did my pedicure she was friendly and talkative the deluxe essential pedicure i thought was just ok the girl next to me got the express pedicure looking back had i known i would have gotten the express as well the deluxe had the exfoliation and heat wrap for the foot but i dont think it was worth the difference loved the massage chair d had a bit of a difficult time communicating with ken he did my manicure he offered to do a d flower on my nails i thought it was included in the price of the french gel it was an additional dont think it was worth it plus i didnt know it costed more until i saw the bill but i guess it is also partially my fault for not asking if it costs more money he filed and painted my nails while i was still sitting in the pedicure chair it was a bit awkward the other customers didnt get their manicures done until after they were done with their pedicure he filed and painted all the while my hand was a bit of an awkwarduncomfortable position as i was leaving i noticed i was left with white marks from the french tip on my hands overall it was an interesting experience ive had my nails for about a week now the beads that was part of the d flowers design have began falling apart would i do it again dont think so too pricey for me i like to hop around when it comes to getting my nails done because like any artist everyone has their own style of doing things and i like to see different techniques i have been here times and have gone to amy she is very warm and friendly and does an amazing manicure and pedicure she is very thorough and can get the rough spots i normally have such ticklish feet but she is able to do it without me hardly flinching ive tried the ice cream and deluxe pedicure with the paraffin treatment and was very satisfied with both they give you actual ice cream to eat with the ice cream pedi they also offer you a cold beverage which is a very nice touch the new room they added is gorgeous and the color and lighting is very relaxing they even have a big screen tv and have movies playing i had the acrylic nails with gel the first time that was the perfect color high glossy looking bubble gum pink i was looking for and she painted a very pretty flower on them they have tons of gel colors to choose from not as many regular polish but this didnt bother me as i normally like to bring my own color and i think most people get gel now anyway amy was very good at recommending treatments for my feet and colors for my nails this last time i changed the color and got the rockstar gel nails over acrylic and i love them they look like candy and have gotten so many compliments the management and staff are very friendly and warm and you feel welcomed when you walk in the door the receptionist is a very cute sweet girl whos always smiling and attentive in keeping the front moving along i will definitely be going back to amy in two weeks very nice place my husband and i both enjoyed the deluxe pedicure probably one of the top two pedicures that ive received in my life i made a same day appointment during the week and was glad that i did as it was crowded everyone was super nice and we had complimentary massages will return again next time i am in vegas several months in and my love for diamond nails is still going strong i see winnie very three weeks for gel nails and a pedi and couldnt imagine going anywhere else ive been here three times now and every time has been a star experience i am in love with my gel manicures that christy does for me with bling and studs actually im quite in love with christy and the other gals who work there everyone is super friendly and i feel very much at ease there never rushed christy always spends as much time as she needs on me even as i hmm and huuuh over the colors i want or where i want the rhinestones or studs shes super patient very artistic and hilarious shes always on time and everyone there has super cute nails so if you walk in having no idea what you want on your nails just look around the possibilities are endless im very pleased at the cleanliness of the place theyre highly organized keep your information on file and for a non cash carrier such as myself they allow you to pay with a creditdebit card and you can add the tip right on super convenient on top of the gel manicures christy gives the best pedicures i live in vegas and wear flip flops about days out of the year that can lead to some preeeety dry feet after my first pedicure with her my feet were so soft i really couldnt stop talking about how amazed i was with the results it was truly quite epic anyways i know there are nail shops on every single corner in vegas but this place is worth the drive i love in summerlin and probably drive pass up shops that are closer just to come here love it love it i was wanting some pampering on a sunday morning and i was so happy to see that diamond nails spa are open on sundays fellow yelper vanessa n raves about this place so i decided to give it a try i arrived a few minutes after opening and was seen within minutes for hot rock pedi and a gel mani both techs were nice and friendly the establishment was clean and organized i see that they offer other services like waxing and massages i think the prices were reasonable and fair i will be back in a few weeks for some more tlc i expected more from the reviews basic nail salon with the usual grungy corners and communication problems minute pedi for no bargain broken chair massage for a couple of us a few of the girls were friendly but for our person group no one was dying to run back there gotta love a spa where the staff pops a squat outside and lights up before youve even driven away save the trip i went somewhere else before that was practically empty they werent they attentive so i walked out and found diamond nail spa which was right next door so far a great place people are nice and i love the color selection they have this place is awesome one of the best pedicures ive ever had i wish i could go there regularly but i actually live in southern california i found the salon by looking on yelp the people are super friendly the place is very clean and their prices are comparable to what im used to paying i would definitely go back and would highly recommend diamond nails to others loved this place my wife and i came here for my birthday week end i got the hot stone therapy it was great i got pampered them stones started out blazing at first but after a while i got used to it it is a little pricey but well worth it i dont get pedicures all the time but the few i have had this is the best been here a couple times while my boyfriend and i were living on this side of town they always do a great job love all the nail techs ive had ive never chosen any one to give me manicure but winie shes definitely the best shes so sweet and detailed orientated she knows what shes doing i chose the design and every time she made them exactly the way i wanted choose her and you will never regret did anyone of you ever asked them how much it cost when you are about to pay do you ask what exactly are you paying for i went there times i have nothing bad to say about their work in terms of the way my nails looks like however i just realized by looking on my receipts and bank statements that they were charging me different amount each time even though i did the same exactly thing at least twice i realize that after being there last week and the paper that they were about to charge me from said i asked them what this is for and they said that because they used sponge they charge me more i explained that i did exactly the same thing and paid for the gel last time you can find my receipt in the pictures and they kept saying its so wait if its how did you get to they said its the flower i added to the nail but the flower is only so i just agreed to pay and left i felt so bad that i needed to check my previous receipt to make sure i wasnt wrong and i wasnt so i wont go there again because i rather find a place i can trust if you do go there simply ask how much and keep the receipts again i feel horrible writing a bad review especially when their actual manicure was good however i want to make sure everyone will at least know to ask for the prices ive been to this nail salon for a while now but some lady by the name of jackie did my nails and i had a horrible experience so never again she was so rough with my hands and every time she was done looking at one hand she would throw it instead of gently going to my next hand another thing about this nail salon is that they always change their prices and ive been going here for maybe months now i get the same thing all the time and they always change the prices up on me and one time i confronted them about it they were just stuttering and hesitating and making up lame excuses another thing that bothered me was that jackie was so rough with my hands she had cut my finger and i was bleeding i dont know about you but there should be no reason why there would be a cut not anywhere near your nail it was on my knuckle another thing was that i asked if she could just draw a cross which is lines and she couldnt even do that so i got charged more for a damn d cross that i did not want i will never be going here ever again and i was a loyal customer who always tipped no matter what but no thanks im good i saw yuki tonight its the first time in almost years since ive had my nails done and she was awesome salon is comfortable and clean i went to diamond nails for a girls night i was greeted right away asked what i wanted done and to pick a color i got a gel manicure and it feels like it will be on my nails for more than two weeks excellent job i would def go back easy to get to off the strip there are two sections the gorgeous chandelier side and the boring strip mall nail salon side which is where i was placed along with my two girlfriends they were great about getting us in all at the same time and even gave my friend a little bday giftie the tech who did my manicure gave me a sort of lame manicure in the sense that she briefly filed my nails painted them then randomly threw on some lotion and massaged my hands at the end there was a lot of confusion between gel and shellac manicures and im certain i paid for a more expensive manicure but got the cheaper option grr got this done on saturday its thursday now and my nails are still shiny and have no chips overall great place for a quick manipedi id go back if i had a car and needed the service in vegas happy not to have to pay vegas spa prices i have a lovehate relationship with this place i used to go here for all of my nail needs but during the last couple times they did my gel manipedi at the same time which is way too much going on i can see if i asked for it or didnt have an appointment but switching hands and feet in to the lights at the same time is just too much takes the relaxation out of it however they do do one of the better pedicures ive gotten in vegas the hot stone one is awesome awesome spot every service ive ever had here has been top notch the place is clean inviting friendly and elegant enough to make you feel like youre not just in another corner nail salon but casual enough so you feel like you can pop in wearing jeans and a pony tail and not be sized up by the staff speaking of the staff every galguy who has taken care of me has been kind a good communicator and generally pleasant the owner is a wonderful man i could go on i have nothing bad to say about this spa prices are great gel nails last forever easy to get to unlike spas in casinos the list goes on highly recommend mai did an awesome job with my nails i wont go anywhere else thank you wen my nail tech left from another salon i know its time to look for another nail place i found this place and was impressed with their great reviews today i decided to try it and man im loving it so far james did my nails and he is amazing great attention to details amazing foot massage im definetly coming back i loved this place i got my first gel manicure here super cute mama gives the best massages the best make an appt online i made an appointment the second time for me and two friends one massage and two pedicures i didnt receive a confirmation call so i called them at hours before our pm appointment they said ok but then called me back minutes later saying that the masseuse called in with a family emergency seriously when were they going to let us know so we cancelled all of our appointments i had a terrible experience here i had a gel mani and first they cut my cuticles so well that two of them were bleeding second the girl who did my mani acted like a was a burden to her and huffed and puffed at me when i asked her to fix a spot on my nail that was showing through the polish last of all the mani cure was peeling off in days because of poor application it was very thick and clumpy i will never go back and will not let any of my girlfriends if im going to pay dollars for a gel mani at other shops then i expect descent costumer service the only positive thing would have to be their selection of gel colors udate the owner sam contacted me and offered to have another tech do my gel mani at no charge and she was amazing her name is christie she did beautiful job and gave me great service she listened to my needs and most importantly a flawless mani im proud to show of these pretty fingers now thanks so much i will be back to see christie for sure my friend and i tried diamond for the first time yesterday i read the good reviews and thought wed give it a shot we arrived minutes early for our appts the placed was packed after we walked in they turned someone away because they wouldnt have a tech available for a couple hours we waited a few minutes and were brought to massage chairs but asked not to put our feet in just yet about minutes later we were beginning to wonder what was the hold up there is an lady roaming around who must be in charge eventually she gave us the ok to soak but by then the water was cold she tried to drain some of the cold water and put in more warm but it never did get hot enough for me when i reserved our appointments i specified the type of pedis we wanted but we were still given a book of options and asked to choose our service finally about minutes late techs finished their manicures and came to us i really dont get dry skin or have a lot of maintenance to do i like my toes to be polished and the massage with hot stones to soothe my poor tired feets unfortunately i was dissatisfied with the hot stone rub i did not feel soothed or that the stones were placed to help release the tension in the muscles to make the massage more effective she also spent more time on one foot than the other so i can definitely say my left foot was neglected she did do a good job with the polish they offer other spa services including eyebrow tinting my friend wanted to know more about it and the woman who does it seemed annoyed to have to answer a question she was a little mean actually i dont think my friend and i will be returning and so the search for the best pedicure will continue i love this place i am very picky about my nature nails and over the past year i have enjoyed the way james does my nails fantastic service at this place the staff is like family my feet are smooth and pretty everytime christy is done i can show them to the world carmalita also does my massages and i feel like a new woman when shes done no more aches and pains this place is the best the designs are pretty however my nails barely lasted one week before the gel started to peel off i paid expect my mani to last more than one week such a disappointment the place was clean and the staff was one of the friendliest i have ever experience as far as nail salons go jimmy is the man nice massage and good french technique all and all best experience in the sw and ive been looking for over a year ill be back for sure ive been to diamond nails about half a dozen times and have had great experiences still like at most nail salons they sometimes dont do a good job letting the polish dry between coats which means it smudges easily i like that they have a menu for pedicures and arent super pushy trying to push additional services i was in the market to find a new nail salon in las vegas i recently met up with a friend and loved her nails when i saw them and so she recommended i try diamond nails and spa she also said she had a fabulous massage while she was there i stopped by today just for a gel polish change i recently tore one of my nails and my purse yanked majority of the rest if it off since the tear wasnt enough lol i had a nail tip done that fixed the problem right up and i love my nails service was quick as well which is always nice when youre out running errands already i will definitely make this my new go to place for nails thanks again best pedicure ever denise was awesome ice cream pedicure was super relaxing and a glass of champagne was a nice way to relax in the massage chair walked in because we were ignored at d nails in the next shop over my friend and i got two french pedicures and we were both done in less than mins very rushed and left to dry in the pedi chair upon checkout the front desk agent couldnt find our receipts and it just wasnt a welcoming experience felt rushed and i like to enjoy my pedicures this was the first manicure ive ever had thought id take my mom so we can experience it together they did seat us in separate rooms so next time i hope we get seated together place looked really clean and friendly staff they were very busy and we were walk ins and were seated right away they kept offering snacks and water which was really nice my mother and i both got acrylics with french tips which they first told me it was only going to cost each ended up being even though my mother and i got the same thing our receipt explains the up charge for something totally different okay my nails were done really quick and easy the man who did my nails said hes been doing it for years and it showed but my mothers nails took forever there were little flaws on two of her nails which arent terrible just expected it to look great despite the fact that her nails took the longest out of the both of us when we explained that to the lady ringing us up she said to come back if the nails get damaged and theyll fix it for no cost which i was really happy about overall it was a good experience so far so good thanks diamond nails friendly staff love everyone but sam was super helpful today james is epic at nail art and french tips highly recommend absolutely love this place the staff is super friendly and the venue is very clean christy is the best she always finds time to fit me in for an appointment and does an amazing job i still drive across town to get my nails done by her wouldnt go anywhere else christie is the best and is a pro at doing stiletto nails i would highly recommend seeing her or at the very least just going to this nail salon the staff are all very friendly and accommodating the salon itself is super clean and very nice everything is very reasonably priced as well talented nail techs are few and far between i am so grateful that i found christie came to have a pre wedding day with the girls for my sister staff was friendly and accommodating had enough chairs for us to be together while we all had our mani pedi i had jamie she was awesome she took her time and didnt rush me her attention to detail was very much appreciated considering ive had bad experiences with pedicures before i highly recommend this location but they get busy so make sure you make an appointment before hand jimmy did a great job on my manicure today treated my mom to a manipedi with jenny and she is a happy woman right now service is always good at diamond nails oh em gee i love this place my friend rachel r found this place on yelp she booked our appointments online and right away we got a confirmation e mail and text the day before we got another text and e mail reminder and again the day of having to make the appointments online there were minute difference from the three appointments we walked in and the employee told us we should have just called it in and told them we were going together luckily there were three spots available next to each other our appointments were at ish and they were super busy my friends and i did the chocolate and champagne pedicure it was perfect your feet are soaked in a warm chocolate aroma bath rich with antioxidants while youre enjoying a glass or of champagne all of the hot stone therapy pedicures include plus exfoliation with aromatic chocolate scrub and a paraffin treatment it was an awesome experience that i would recommend this to my friends who are visiting vegas the staff were also very friendly i came in this morning around am and jenni took me right away i explained to her that i wanted to take my acrylics off because i wanted to change the color of the acrylics nail bed she took it off without damaging any of my nails she then explained to me things i never really knew she did the most outstanding job ive ever seen literally these are nail extensions with pink and white gel polish i wantes more white than normal and i got moon shaped extensions essentially she made it look like they were pink and white acrylics bravo awesome nail shop the people were so friendly and welcoming they did a fantastic job will be back wasnt planning on going here but i was glad i did mai pronounced my did my pedi and she cleans like really cleans out my cuticles very satisfied with her especially how some salons only push back my cuticles my feet are squeaky clean n pretty to look at lol thanks mai jessica did my gel mani she was nice as well n people that worked there offered me bottle cold water and fruit snacks wait time was i was taken in right away and it was busy at that will be coming back thanks girls i am giving stars not only for the excellent service provided but also because of the friendliness of the staff and how clean and organized everything is i came in as a walk in and although they were busy i was warmly greeted and my wait was no longer than min after many years of trial and error with different nail salons i had almost given up on finding someone who could deal with my very sensitive skin and today i was lucky enough to be assigned to mai she took her time to explain to me the entire process and very delicately worked with my nails this is my first full set in over five years and not only are they gorgeous but she did not harm my skin at all i got a pedi and a full set and i dont plan on going anywhere else for a long time it was a great experience mai has herself a client ive always gotten the best service here i wont go anywhere else vegas with pedicures at most places ill leave and my feet are just as dry as when i came in but not here they also do great gel manicures and full sets its busy all the time i highly recommend making an apt ahead of time this is my go to place for gel mani pedi in my line of work i have to upkeep my nails so ive been to many many places in town and this venue has the best quality and work ethics the decor is simple the venue itself isnt very big the prices are standard for gel mani christy is my go to girl but she rarely ever takes walk ins so i advise to arrange apt worst manicurist ever came here to pamper myself on my birthday i told the woman on the phone that i wanted to make sure that i got a massage with my pedicure she said that massage was included i signed up the deluxe pedicure and had the unfortunate luck to get jimmy both people next to me had longer times in the chair and they were there before me he rushed through the massage and did not seem to know what he was doing these sage i did get was rough and my back kept hitting the back not the chair his nails needed cutting as they cut into the bottoms if my feet i had to wait even though i had an appointment and was out witching hour when i complained the reduced the price by big deal what should have been a relaxing time was annoying my advice is to find a different salon that cares for customer service came into town from boston to visit my dad did my research found this place for my stiletto nails christy was amazing took such good care of me my nails were perfect and i had a great time there ill be back management was kind and professional prices were amazing luv luv luv they always accommodate you very professional super clean i was in a bit of a rush today so they did a gel pedicure and gel manicure at the same time this place i made an appointment with mai at today and was seated close to not only were they late but she did a very sloppy job and my nails photo posted were crooked after she was done she sent me to the sink to wash my hands when i came back she was already gone setting up another station no thank you or goodbye how rude apart from the rude service mai took a nail clipper from the womans station next to us and used it on my nails it was already used and was not clean how unsanitary i will not be returning to this salon and was so disappointed the woman at the front desk was very polite and sweet would not recommend going here the service was sub par at best do not make appointments with mai my daughters and i have used this nail spa many times after finding it on yelp there are many good manicurist here they are friendly courteous and the shop is clean i highly recommend this business mai is the best she is so nice and i love that i can show her a picture of a nail design and she can make it look a hundred times better if you are in need of a nail tech definitely go to her but make sure to make an appointment because the best are always busy went here today bc my normal nail place was booked until when i got there at glad that i did the staff was super friendly and they had diff types of pedis you could get was awesome got the deluxe pedi bc i needed it my feet feel awesome and got a gel mani they did mani while i got my pedi and got me out super fast nice to not have to waste my day cindy did my nails and sam did my mani massage both did a great job ive been going to this place for over a year and i always get complimented on my nails christy does the best nail art shes so meticulous and i go to james for my pedicure because he gives the best massages hes also done some awesome nail art for my manicures as well they both are always booked so make your reservations in advance they recently renovated the space to make it bigger which is nice because i havent gone a day where it wasnt busy every transactions you get a discount great incentive to come back i love coming here because theyve become family at this point perfect diamond nails was the answer to my prayers all the staff is friendly welcoming and attentive the environment is the perfect escape after a long day mai is my nail tech in particular she is the best she takes her time and she explains and educates why she does your nails the way she does and lets you know what need to be done to keep them healthy and to get the outcome you want for your nails when mai does your nails not only do they look and feel amazing they last a long time thanks mai and thank you diamond nails brandi i get a manipedi at this salon every weeks i typically can call and make an appointment that very same day a variety of nail technicians have done my nails here and they all do an amazing job they have a large selection of gel colors to choose from i get compliments on the sparkly colors on my toes all the time and the pedicure lasts longer than weeks very satisfied every time i walk out of the salon very beautiful inside clean and busy there are probably more than a dozen employees with hostesses catering to you when you walk in the work is beautiful and clean as well i came in with an inspirational look and they matched it right on point poor quality nail salon i came in today to get my gel nails removed and repainted with regular nail polish i told the lady that i wanted my nails cut shorter square and nicely shaped after removing my gel the woman took out her clippers and cut my nails so short that i could feel my exposed nail beds she then proceeded to file them even shorter until i showed her she was filing my skin she reminded me i said short and began applying bonding oil and a top coat she painted my nails so beastly that she made the opi nail polish look bumpy and cheap i told her i hated my sloppy nails so she took the polish off and told the boss lady i wanted someone else to do my nails she signaled a smoking man to come inside who sat down without washing his hands the only thing i could say was you smell like cigarettes which was answered by a giggle meaning i didnt understand what you said by this point i had had enough and decided to leave i went to the front and offered to pay for the gel soak off and was told it would cost for chopped unpainted nails i couldnt do it and said i am unhappy with my service and i am not paying for anything while sitting in my car looking up directions i was approached by the first nail lady she tried to explain that she did her job and should receive compensation i reminded her she did a terrible job and didnt earn the payment she stood there dumbfounded as i rolled up my window note to all the nail salons out there you have to cater to people with natural nails just as much as you cater to people with artificial and gel nails i wanted to try this place based on the highly rated reviews i had an appointment at it is now thirty five minutes later and i have yet to have someone come over and start my pedicure the water is cold my ankles are itchy and someone who came in after me got their services started before me why even bother making an appointment i wont be coming back i yelped this location and it is snot far from my house so i decided to give it a try i made an appointment on line with mai mai is super friendly and nice she has small talks with me making me feel as if i m visiting a friend absolutely love it i showed her a picture of the design i want but at first i didnt want to pay more for the gel she explained to me why gel might be better for this specific design and showed me without gel what it looked like she did convinced me to get the gel nail in stead and it came out super cute exactly like the picture i showed her i will certainly come back to her next time this was a great find i moved from summerlin over to mountains edge and needed to find a new nail salon i found them by looking on yelp and they had great reviews so i tried it out ive been going there now for a year and ive never been disappointed great job diamond nails i went here in and today its my nails already came off i paid for gel nails and the quality really sucks and not to mention the sister duo can smack talk for hours about people the whole time i sat with my nail tech her sister also works there all they were doing was talking shit about people in english and then in their language i mean really if you so have many good reviews must be its time for you to talk to your staff and explain them the importance of customer service talking shit about people is not entertaining the lady the reception was very nice and cordial and the one who charged me was also nice its the just the technician and her poor quality of work and smack talking is the reason why i would not recommend this place you run a salon not a high school were girls hang out and talk shit about people very negative enviorment and poor quality of work i wish i could give them star ive been here a few times and this is my new go to spot i go to mai and she does a phenomenal job every time i have gotten so many compliments on my nails i cant fathom enough how good mai is was in vegas and needed a pedicure and manicure badly showed up without an appointment and waited about mins on a thursday during lunch time i got jimmy to do my pedicure and i chose got stone pedicure which costs but if you add gel its with gel its and upgraded that costs more i chose and ombre nail look so add on another not bad if you ask me but i live in hawaii so its significantly more there anyway tuyet did my mani and it was gel as well with ombre and accent nail goal for that is yes it was pricey but it was totally worth for the look that i wanted if i ever come back i will come back here again i am in love with this place i had went through so many different nail shop and i have never found a person that does such an amazing job like mai she takes her time and make sure that you are percent comfortable and in love with your nails before she continues everytime i ask for a new design she gets it right on point and she does an amazing job again i wouldnt trade her for anything ive been coming here for years and wouldnt go anywhere else i love the staff and i always get the absolute best service this is the best nail salon in las vegas hands down this nail salon is one of the best in vegas i recently moved to las vegas and have tried several nail salons diamond nail salon exceed my expectations with friendly staff and excellent service i am highly impressed i have been going here for over years and would never go anywhere else it is always immaculately clean the staff is friendly and definitely aim to please christy is the absolute best she remembers your likes and dislikes and offers up some great suggestions they have a great variety of pedicures to choose from treat yourself to something fun ive been here twice first visit i didnt have the best lady but the amenities are great super clean and everything was sanitized second visit i got cindy whom my mother had on the first visit and was excited to have her because she did such a good job with my mom she was great very sweet and accommodating i have long natural nails and she took great care while filing them i highly recommend this place but definitely make an appointment i just happened to show up before a rush and a lot of women had to wait or left due to the wait the front desk lady was super sweet and helped make the whole experience enjoyable i will definitely be back i made appointment prior to coming here but still waited for an hour the place is nice but looks can be deceiving because of the bad service they provided me please dont waste your time coming here totally not worth the wait mai is absolutely amazing i was oh so lucky enough to get assigned to her at my latest walk in and now i can honestly say that i will be booking all future appointments with her she is extremely nice and a total perfectionist she will always be honest with you when asking her opinion on the nail design that youre contemplating on getting so definitely go and check her out the reason i docked a star off is because prior to my extremely fortunate encounter with mai the other technicians i have dealt with just didnt seem to wow me there have been a couple times i wasnt satisfied with my service but i continued to come to this location due to its proximity to both work and home as long as mai is working there ill be a regular on a visit to las vegas i had some extra time and decided to get my nails done i checked yelp and look at all the great reviews so decided on diamond nails from the reviews i thought this place was different than the rest of the asian nail salons when i arrived i decided to upgrade to a higher price pedicure what a mistake they gave me the same silly pedicure that ive gotten a million times before only charging me not even filing off the dead skin off my heels what a total disappointment i was also scheduled to get my fingernails done when i went over to the fingernail station there were nail fillings all over the place it looked like nobody had cleaned in at least a month stay clear of this place if you have any sense about you it is dirty and very disappointing i was calling around to find a place that could get my wife right in i called this place and was told they could get us right in i said we would be there in minutes no problem we got there and waited a little while was told she would be seeing one of the best the nail dude asked my wife some very personal and strange questions while working on her when done we got to the car and realized the nails were of varying length also the sides of the nails were not properly filed went back in and one of the owners said she would fix them turns out she was so distracted she made my wifes finger start bleeding and still did a poor job the owners daughter was running around the business cute little girl but very unprofessional her other daughter was arguing that she did not want to bring the little girl to get food as it was too hot outside unless the dad gave her his car would not go back yelp reviews failed on this one this salon is incredible i highly appreciate the attention to detail when it comes to my particular nails and how they grow mai is so nice and knowledgeable about nails she does the best designs and is a real perfectionist come in and enjoy being pampered but this place gets really busy so i suggest making an appointment if you want your nails done perfectly and also want someone down to earth and cool to talk to go see christy she does the best nails and will do any design or pattern you can think of shes so creative and has the funniest personality as well as quick service my best friend at diamond nails and if youre looking for a wonderful on point eyebrow waxing ask for mai she is the only woman on earth who can do my eyebrows and get them perfect you guys wont be disappointed i promise you i have been coming here for the last years ever since i moved to this area all of the nail techs are amazing james and stephanie are my top two go to people the owner sam and his wife do a great job running the place and making sure everything is perfect everyone is so friendly and the price is what you would expect for a nail shop of this caliber if you want a full set from a chop shop this is not the place for you i have been coming here for a few years and love it james and sam are always amazing and im so excited they expanded and have extended there hours the staff is always friendly and helpful i always recommend them to friends and coworkers when they are looking for a nail spa thank you mai you are such a sweetheart first of all i like the convenience of making online reservations i selected my services and chose the nail technician mai was highly recommended by fellow helpers within minutes of making the reservations two days prior i got an email confirming the appointment of am then a day before they called to change the time to pm because of the type of service i wanted that would fit in with the technician better on day of appointment i received a text reminder for my original appointment of am i called the salon right away to explain that my time had changed because someone called me and they said its confirmed for the later appointment and they apologized that the original online booking was not updated made it to the salon it was super busy the salon was clean noise level was decent considering there were a lot of customers i was even surprised to see a few gentlemen in the pedimassage booths and another one getting a manicure done guess if the salon is good for the guys its probably awesome for the women my nail tech was mai and we hit it off very well i showed her some pics of nails that i had an idea of getting normally i do very neutral nail colors but went out of my comfort zone to go darker i asked mai to suggest some fall colors and she showed my colors i had her recommend me the colors because i wasnt sure what would match my skin tone she did some test samples on my nails and voila found my color from my sample pics i wanted some rockstar glitter ombre look and she said in confidence i can do that for you it will look very nice and i would really let you have your moneys worth because i will tell you if it didnt match so that type of honesty made me made me feel at ease that i chose the right nail tech looks like i just started a long relationship will definitely be coming back thanks fellow yelpers and mai mai is the best nail artist ever shes not only great at what she does shes also extremely compassionate towards her clients love her work and i never leave disappointed everyone needs to go to her i came here with the bf for a pedicure he brought me not the other way around he is a fan of regular pedicures so we made it a couple adventure haha this salon is huge and has extended hours they are open until pm but there is an extra charge for services done after pm pedicures started at for the regular and worked its way up depending on other options you want i didnt need champagne and chocolate so i was good i was very happy that the tools were in sterile packs like at the dentist the ladies were great and very kind we came in as walk ins and we had to wait a little because we we got there in between shifts but it was only about minutes not bad at all i would definitely come back the next time im in vegas to visit i want to try a gel manicure sometime love love love this spa i have watched them grow and expand while maintaining their amazing customer service i can get it all here gel manis pedis waxing and even eye lash extensions i wont go anywhere else excellent service super nice staff i went in for a pedicure and got christy shes a gem best footleg message ive ever had this place used to be really good however the customer service has really gone downhill after making an appointment i wasnt seen for minutes after my appointment time the front desk girl didnt even give me a heads up when i checked in that they were running behind other clients were complaining and although the front desk girl apologized there was no acknowledgement from the owner discount given or any type of compensation to make up for the long wait id suggest they call clients to let them know if theyre running that far behind or at least tell them upon check in some sort of im sorry compensation would be appreciated too with so many nail salons around youd think customer satisfaction would be a priority i wont be going there again i receive the best pedis here courtesy of andrew he is awesome and i like the fact that its a calming mood in there thanks for great service the few times ive been here i havent had to wait an insanely long time theyre well staffed and very friendly great customer service and reasonable prices i have a different person each time and theyve all been wonderful however after this last time i think im leaning towards cindy shes quick but not sloppy and listens to exactly what i want diamond nails is a keeper my nails look great dont get me wrong but for a simple shellac mani pedi i dont think it shouldve been after tip maybe i shouldve looked at the prices before coming here the place itself is very nice and the nail techs definitely take their time on you lynn did a great job on my nails annie did such a wonderful job i cant express how much i appreciate her work and patience she had she kept apologizing cause i waited three hours and i told her it was ok it wasnt her fault i gave four because of the long wait i had if its busy dont even bother might as well go back another day and make an appt back to annie she understood everything i talked to her about and sincere i would def go back to see her tnx annie i moved into this neighborhood and finding a good nail salon was important i tried several and were not impressed then i found christie at diamond nails shes very talented in her trade and shes really enjoyable to spend time with the business itself is always clean and every member of the staff is friendly they get to know you and call you by name when i walk into diamond nails i feel like i walked into a hug christie is amazing at what she does she gives an incredible pedicure takes her time and makes you feel completely relaxed by the time you are finished christie also does a flawless job on finger nails too i highly recommend the salon and especially christie sam the owner i think is also very friendly and polite i was recommended by several friends to come here i was hesitant to make the drive since i have a nail spot in henderson i tried it out because i needed a full and theyre open late i was welcomed there with open arms and got kelly shes the sweetest tech and everything i wanted she did with no complaints i love lincoln park after dark as my fall color and she put a subtle sparkle to it i am now convinced i will make the drive there best nail salon in the city they do a very decent job here i like it because they also offer water free manicures the water is so hard here i dont like soaking my cuticles in it just makes them crack so i will return for that reason however the place is filthy it really needs a good scrub down thats why i gave it stars instead of clean it up this is a good make an appointment day of kinda place they have tons of gel colors how i came to know of them years ago when most places had about they recently expanded into the store front next to them so theres like pedi chairs not exactly sure i dont have a go to person here but with the exception of once ive had decent enough service the massage chairs are nice and theyve defiantly put some effort into the decor its a great place when you decide you want your nails done in the next hours kinda spot been coming here for over years and for the most part everyone does a great job i personally recommend christy shes quick knows her stuff and my gels stay on without chipping for up to weeks the owners are very nice im always taken in right away for my appointments and they have a great selection of gel colors and they arent pretentious like that other nail polish place down the street okay so let me start by saying that usually i go to polished nail salon which is right down the street from diamond i came in to get my nails changed and i chose to go to diamond because they were open later than polished usually is i made an appointment for pm and there was a five dollar charge because it was considered after hours when i first called to schedule this appointment i had asked the receptionist to please put me with someone who is good at doing gel because usually i go to polished and polished stands by their work and does a really good job plus i get nervous going to someone i dont know the receptionist laughed at me and said oh we are better than polished now knowing that this had been said i shouldve trusted my better judgment and not gone because first of all talking bad about another salon is in bad taste and unprofessional and second of all polished is one of the most successful nail salons in the vegas area so i went to get my nails done and i wanted to get hombre white with just a little glitter the lady who was doing my nails was a very nice lady but she didnt seem to know what she was doing when she started doing my nails she would dab the white onto them and then take a brush and started brushing it out in a weird way it looked so streaked and uneven and it didnt look like hombre at all i told her to put a nude color first then the white to create the blended hombre affect and also so my actual nail wasnt showing and she said no and ignored my request she continued doing what she was doing and when she was finished it honestly excuse my language looked like shit i told her it was streaked and didnt look like hombre and she said well thats how i know how to do it it was so bad to the point where i had asked her to please redo it she gave up and had the owner do it when i asked the owner to use a sponge she pulled out a cheap sponge that left my nails blotchy and uneven and all in all i was completely unhappy with the way they turned out they looked so hideous i took off a day of work to have my nail lady at polished fix them i highly recommend going to polished just down the street they charge a little more but the quality you get is well worth the price which is not something i can say for diamond nails for someone who talked trash on another shop they sure couldnt back it up this place has to be the dirtiest nail salon ever they also do a terrible job just look at the pictures please do not go there you will end up with a fungus like me ick just came here last week with my bestie to get pedicures ive come here once before when i worked at a dental office near this area but havent come since mainly because driving here from the galleria mall area kind of sucks lol they have a good selection of pedicures to choose from however i was little surprised when my express pedicure took the same amount of time as my friend getting the deluxe pedicure plus gel manicure hmmm lets just say i was pretty happy with my service however she was not but i can only review on my service soo stars i called ahead of time to make an appointment since we both wanted to be done around the same time the girl on the phone was a liiittle rude and sounded like i was bothering her but she wasnt the one doing my pedicure so whatever lol they have a great selection of gel polishes however their regular polish selection was pretty weak my cleaning was done nicely also the gel pedicure was very clean not sloppy i also had a nice conversation with the owner who was doing my pedicure and mai who was doing the pedicure of the girl next to me my bill came out to pretty average pricing compared to other salons for what i get gel pedicure acrylic on my big toes overall a good job ill definitely be back if im in the area very busy which i love to see i came in for infills and they were done in mins very quick but still very well done luckily they could fit me in i would of given stars but their customer service wasnt perfect clean and a large place thank you i have been going to diamond nails for over years now most of my friends who do not live close to their location still drive the distance because of their amazing customer service every technician is excellent at their job and truly cares about the customers experience in october our entire bridal party went to diamond nails to get pampered for the big day we all took part in the chocolate champagne pedicure that came with hot stone therapy amazing and yes champagne nice and chilled if you want value great people fun vibe and an overall happy experience diamond nails is the only way to go make an appointment because its no secret they are truly the best just had the best manicure and pedicure of my life we came from out of town to get some pre wedding pampering at diamond nails christy was absolutely the best i have sensitive nails and she didnt hurt me at all she was friendly funny and the most skilled nail tech i have ever had the pleasure of dealing with she suggested the gel diamond manicure and pedicure it turned out beautiful my husband to be also got a manicure and pedicure from cindy my soon to be husband thought cindy was wonderful also i highly recommend the ladies here top notch service and they made us laugh too upbeat and fun music is a plus also my best friend and i got our nails done saturday night because it was late we thought we were lucky they were open till pm worst idea ever you get charged dollars a person for coming in late the reason being we have to pay the landlord because were open late you want long nails dollars for length almond shape nails extra dont even ask for designs because its s too complicated and lots of work for us christmas designs are beyond them the technician had to ask the owner for help with a mistletoe design who apparently had lost her touch since she hadnt done it in so long her words not mine i thought bad service and the outrageous racking up of the price for every little reason were the worst id see of this place but i am seriously not surprised my nail separated from the acrylic this morning as i sat at my desk typing stick on nails from the drugstore last longer than their so called finished product they charge you extra for breathing over there i went to hannah twice and i wont be back they charge you for rockstar glitter and an extra for fade but the top of your nail is natural gel so to me youre getting ripped off i wanted all glitter on the nail but she told me it wouldnt look right arent i the customer if i want glitter all over let me have it what really bothered me is when she said oh i understand youre on budget really thanks for that insult its not about being on a budget its about getting ripped off and their basic pedicures are horrible no scrub barely anything done i guess thats what you get for basic but cmon diamond nails and spa was absolutely amazing to my bridal party and myself last weekend not only did they do a stunning job on our mani pedis for my wedding the next day but they also offered us out of towners a ride to our next destination that is service i would give stars if i could thanks guys first time to come here to try out made an appointmen at i waited abt mins and asked the hostess how long i should wait more and guess what she said i dont have any tech available wtf then why did i make an appointment fxxx it that lady is sucks her face was what the fxxx i just walked out phenomenal place everyone is friendly quick and efficient extensive menu that includes a plethora of luxurious pedicure options waxing and other nail related services as a male i occasionally enjoy a french gel pedicure and no judgments are made haha modern music great decor and overall a wonderful salon love before they started their longer hours and hired all those new people this place was awesome now when you go in the receptionists are awful and the nail techs are worse i always get a mani and pedi which should be relaxing and enjoyable but it is anything but they start my toes and work on my hands at the same time all they want to do is rush you through your treatment the bosss wife is the worst she does a horrible job and tries to sell you other products by telling you your face is oily and she can fix it thanks the final straw for me was paying for a gel mani and have my nail break a day later i went in to have them fix my one nail and sat there for minutes then the receptionist said it would still be about a minute wait if she told me that it would be over an hour wait i would have left but instead i sat there waiting for one nail these people need to take a course in customer service meanwhile ill take my business elsewhere i come in here everytime i need my nails done and every single time they have offered me amazing world class service the staff is so friendly and personable they really know how to make me feel comfortable and relaxed christy usually does my nails and she is awesome i definitely recommend diamond nails my coworkers and i all come here i am in love with this place im new to vegas and stopped on a whim boy am i glad andrew is amazing wow i will never go anywhere else went in there to get stilleto nails was very pleased kelly did an amazing job thank you so much i definitely will come here each time i come to vegas i absolutely love diamond nails the service is great the options are limitless and who can complain about their extended hours i adore my cute nails and prefer the rockstar mani sparkly gel nails that last two weeks its perfect for people like me who type all day and clean a lot at home the only reason i didnt give stars is because its a little more pricey than other salons still worth it though this is one busy salon and i can see why they do great work i chose a fancy design off of pintrest and they copied it to a t my pedicure looks awesome i will never go back here again my best friend and i decided to get our nails done at this salon we were so happy because they are open until pm which was very convenient for us we made an appointment ahead of time and was greeted by a friendly lady she asked us about the type of nail style design and color that we wanted and we told her exactly what we wanted everything was fine until she mentioned gel nails i work in customer service and i understand sales and adding on to clients etc i think its great but if a client tells you that they are not interested you should respect that and move on basically after the lady upfront insisted us to do gel nails our nail technicians were doing the same thing i rarely get irritated with this type of situations because i understand that they need to make money but please if a client says no to gel nails dont take it personally get annoyed or be rude this used to be my go to nail salon before i discovered modern nails on eastern i like diamond nails they definitely provide quality gel and acrylic manicures theyre not the cheapest nail salon gel polish is and acrylic gel polish is or so before getting any design or glitter the majority of their nail techs do a nice job but not all im pretty picky about how i like my nails so to skip the disappointment i just explain now that i would like the polish as close to my cuticle as possible i hate when they paint what feels like inches away from your cuticle so it looks like you got your nails done last week instead of today and make sure i am fully satisfied with the shape of my nails before they start painting on the polish if you live over on rainbow i would definitely recommend i love this place ive only gone here twice but it already made me a loyal customer they are all so nice and fun to talk to while getting your nails done my nails are flawless i was really hoping my nails would last longer than days the staffowner was wonderful and friendly i really liked that they were open until pm extra charge they speak wonderful english which is a bonus the atmosphere was just great unfortunately my nails were falling off after only days my daughter also got her nails done there with me and her nails have lasted so i dont know i dont dare spend another to find out ask for christy she is awesome i havent worn my nails in about a year but she knew exactly what i wanted needed it was like she could read my mind my services only took an hour and i got a full set the prices are great and the service is splendid i recommend an appointment because she comes highly recommended this is trisha adams winnie enough said this cheaky lil thing keeps me entertained ever since ive been coming to her two years her work is the best just let her do her thing and relax this place is busy make sure to make an appointment or be ready to wait the service was wonderful i got the deluxe paid extra money but it was worth it she did such a great job worth going again there was no wait time probably because it was a weekday and in the a m yuki provided me with an awesome deluxe pedicure will be back again it was an overall great experience pedi was ok i think his name is andrew he was not friendly at all i wish they would offer me a drink or magazine winnie is my go to girl ive been going to her for about three years now i adore her and her services ive also been serviced by andrew and mai theyre great as well theyre always busy so i recommend scheduling an appointment ive walked in before and have been worked on by two people at once i cant stand that i hate feeling rushed and obligated to have to tip two different people i work hard and pay a lot of money every two weeks to pamper myself so again id make an appointment if youre wanting to relax and enjoy being pampered maybe it was just my bad luck today but completely disappointed with my nails first time here and asked about pink and white full set because i wanted something very natural looking or else i was just going to get a pedicure i asked a bunch of questions and was assured it be great when it was done there were lines across most of my nails a big chip came out of the edge of one by the time i got home and the nail tech had cut me with the cuticle board trying to clean up her sloppy acrylic work also asked for more rounded nails and she left them squared because she thinks they look better with the white tips i came back to see what they could do to fix and was told they would always look that was because of my short nail beds would have been good to know ahead of time they offered to polish over and after that they look even worse bumpy and sloppy the nail tech was telling me while she fixed my nails what i should have done to begin with instead that would have looked nicer again would have been great to know beforehand i wasted for something that should have been and it looks horrible totally bummed by their bad work and service lets start with the fact that i just paid for a pedicure i couldve done myself at home i came to diamond nails because my regular nail salon was closed super small nail polish selection then the lady that did my pedi was in a big rush i find out she had an appointment coming in i asked for a design on my toe and she said she could only do it on gel not regular polish who are you kidding the owners grandkid climbing all over the place when i first walked in a lady that had just finished her pedi left looking annoyed i found out quickly why at the end the owner asks me how everything went and when i told her the service had a lot of short falls she didnt seem to care much more than making sure the credit card was facing the right way to swipe never again oh and just as an fyi because they wont tell you they charge you an extra for coming in after pm yeah thats right they charge you to come in lol i come here every weeks for a gel mani and sometimes a pedi they are awesome def make an appointment because there is always a wait so worth it though i love thuy the owner and lin ill be going there today they are amazing friendly staff but was disappointed with the long wait had a p appointment for a manipedi and didnt get out of there till p they were extremely busy and understaffed my toes felt like raisins from soaking in the foot spa for so long the girl that did my nails was really nice but when i got home i noticed that she didnt even put a top coat on and had to put my own top coat on the polish by the second day i noticed small chips in my nails on the edges very disappointed with the service i love diamond nails spa i came here a month ago and never wanted to go anywhere else unfortunately i do not live in las vegas or else i would come here every time i needed my nails perfected i came in as a walk in signed in and was told us it would be a min wait expected to be longer because they are amazing and busy but pleasingly was sooner than min i got a gel french tip pedicure from the same nice lady who did my nails the precious month she remembered me and my boyfriend from the last time which is always pleasant i had chipped my toenail but still wanted the square look with my toes so she recommended adding acrylic to fix the look she read my mind they turned out perfect after i got a fill and a color change went with a hot pink w sparkle she recommended a different pink she thought i would like more to ad a little bling i loved the pink i love the different varieties of beautiful colors for all styles she added jewels to my pinky nail and it was my all time favorite nails ill definitely come here every time i come to vegas attempted to schedule and appointment but the front desk person has issues with very poor customer service and personality if this is how a phone call starts then i dont want an appointment mama was super friendly fast service they have complimentary coffee and water as well and lots of gel polish colors to choose from i cant believe it took me so long to finally try out this nail salon i desperately needed my nails done so around pm i walked in and was greeted by the friendly receptionist although this place stays open late it was still pretty packed when i arrived they made sure to find out exactly what services i needed done and had me seated promptly andrew was my nail tech and he did such an amazing job i wanted a specific design on each of my nail which he patiently took his time and really exceeded my expectations he was very precised with the details this is the first time i actually felt that my nails were not being rushed on overall i received amazing service from all the staff that i had encountered with i will definitely be returning soon absolutely fell in love with this place tonight the people who work here were extremely polite an very quick to get us in me an a friend went in for mani pedis an they took us within ten minutes despite the fact there were a lot of people there they did an amazing job on both of our nails an the ladys who worked on us were very nice talkative and sweet completely made my day this is my go to nail salon ive been going here for many years now and they never seem to disappoint i used to come and just get whichever nail tech was available but now my go to guy is andrew if you want beautiful nails and nails that will last long ask for him for the people who are mad about the long wait thats a good thing to know that a place has so many people wanting to get their nails done from the is a good thing unlike the so many nail salons other people can actually go to and just walk right in and get their nails done right away if you dont want quality work dont wait ive seen this place from when they were a small salon and first opened to the booming business that they have now diamond is such a fancy name so they must live up to it i love going here they do such a great job every time and i still continue to come here if everyone always asks me where i get my nails done they must be doing their job came in with four other people and they were super accommodating we were offered water and when they learned i was getting married the next day they brought me a small present im not local but wanted to shout them out for giving me a great no chip mani and pedi mai is the best she went above and beyond making sure my nails looked perfect i will be back to see mai every time im in vegas if i lived here i would come this would be my nail salon and mai would be my go to girl i just got my nails done today i just recently moved to las vegas and wanted a good nail salon to get my nails done i went around pm and no wait they got started on me right after i signed in the lady i had was named thuy pronounced twee she was really sweet and nice she was good at making conversation and making sure i was satisfied with my nails i got the basic acrylic nails with stiletto tips and rhinestones on both my ring fingers total came up to it is and my nails still look nice like when i got them done even if i just got regular polish will go to this place again even though i had an appointment i still had to wait to be seated and even then i had to wait for a technician the technician didnt seem to quite know what she was doing and took forever and had to keep getting up and asking another technician questions before she was even halfway through the water was lukewarm and my feet were pruney when she finally started on my gel color it came out awful looking and crinkly i made them take it off and left since at this point i had been there for over an hour and my toes werent even close to being done and i was still supposed to receive a mask and massage i used to love this place but it seems that they are too busy for their own good my wife and i were pulling in to vegas on friday and my wife wanted a manicure so we searched and found diamond nail salon what a place probably the most efficient nail salon i have ever been in you are greeted at the door and given a bottle of water from there it only gets better my wife suggested that i get a mani and pedi as well lily was the young lady that took care of me my wife had ordered a deluxe pedicure for me lily did an amazing job my hands and feet looked and felt great i recommend lily to anyone going to vegas just make sure to call ahead they can get crazy busy this is our place to go every time we go to vegas enjoy ive been going to andrew for years hes got me hooked im so picky and he always does the best job best shop in vegas hands down this is an awesome nail salon i seriously dont know why i went anywhere else before them i was skeptical at first due to some of the other reviews but andrew at diamond nails is amazing the whole staff in general are very nice and look at my nails a true work of art so on my first visit i was so impressed with the quality of their work the good ambiance in the salon and their very reasonably priced services i called at am that morning to schedule a same day appointment with andrew because of the other reviewer with this same design the receptionist was very nice and scheduled me at my requested time i came in and had just a few minutes wait but i saw carmelita giving another customer a shoulder massage i immediately called the owner over and asked how does that work he said minutes i said deal after my very relaxing massage andrew began his work of art it did not take as long as i had expected but he took his time with the design i told him to take as long as he needed to since i really wanted it to come out perfect and it did when i was on my way out at the cashier i looked down at my toes in comparison to my new nails and i decided i need a pedicure so what the heck i asked if they could squeeze in a pedicure and it was no problem alanna did my toes to match my nails and again great job if you are hesitant about trying diamond nails dont be i have a fill and a full massage scheduled in weeks and i am soooo excited i tried the jelly pedicure and it was amazing it included paraffin wax and hot stone massage i had launa as my technician and she was super meticulous and nice my nails turned out beautifully and i will be a returning customer i definitely recommend trying this salon st of all i would not go to any other place to do my nails none other than diamond nails spa no matter who serves you your in good hands but andrew is awesome my gemstones last and a half weeks n had i not gone in to get them done again they would have lasted an entire month love love love it proof is in the picture thanks andrew all i will say is i am super happy a place like this with them level of customer service is down there way from my house i love kelly not only is she very talented but she is incredibly pleasant and friendly she always listens to exactly what i want and does a perfect job i am pretty picky with the shape of my nails and she always takes the time to make sure i love them ive been so happy every time i have left this salon the salon itself is great very clean and friendly staff dont understand why this place gets raving reviews every time ive gone in my nails have lifted and chipped in the nd and rd day of having them not to mention the techs are not in sync with nail shapes i got different styles of a coffin nail started coming here a few months ago and its always been hit or miss finding a good nail lady anywhere being a new vegas transplant i trusted yelp to point me in the right direction and im glad i did trish has been an absolute godsend with my nails she always has awesome ideas and opinions thanks trish i will never go anywhere else excellent customer service and do great work in little time d im always very happy with everything about my nails the shape cleanliness gel everything and im very picky about them so thats saying a lot i never have to micromanage or worry about who is doing my nails because every employee is excellent especially mai and trish i highly recommend them to everyone the first time i went in i liked it i thought why not the last couple of times ive been i have had such a horrible experience im the type to always have my nails done and they have to look good i went in a couple weeks ago and i was sat down with a girl named lana i believe thats her name i went in for a simple fill we sat down and she started to drill the gel off and she makes a comment about my nails they were coffin shaped and she said these are nigger nails and she started to laugh i personally thought that was really rude and really racist of her to say she finished up and i left two days later my nails just kept breaking i have never had this problem before and i do the same things everyday at work i went back got it fixed and it was fine the last time i went which was about two days ago i got sat down with lana again i told her exactly what i wanted i wanted a new full set coffin shaped she said okay and started on me she was starting to take them off and she ripped off one of my nails on one of my hands and only fully took off nails the rest we soaked and she drilled some of the acrylic off and then proceeded so she pretty much didnt take the full nail off my nails still had hard acrylic on it she went over it with another tip and more acrylic powder just building up i had asked her to make the nail go down because my nails grow up and she goes i dont know what you want me to do i cant just magically make your nails grow down i said just put the tip down so it doesnt show my nail growing up she didnt do what i had asked she put them straight she kept going and was doing my nails square instead of coffin shaped like i asked i asked her about it and she goes oh i forgot like oh wow thanks she rushed and she didnt put as many gel coats as she should have i paid for my services she was lazy and rushed and was rude the whole time she was huffing and puffing and shaking her head like she was mad the whole entire time ive been working in customer service since i was and that was not good customer servicde she was horrible i dont like being rushed while i get my nails done and they ended up looking like crap im going to stick with my normal nail place highland nail and spa in southern highlands they have great customer service and actually take their time on their customers nails never going back to this place again i left there with cut up bleeding and sore nails my go to for gel nails in the city close to my apartment i recommend making an appointment stopped by diamond nails two days in a row around pm both times i was asked to make an appointment for the next day as they were too busy weird its crazy they have that big advertisement stating theyre open until pm but no one has been available to perform a service after christy is the lady you need to go to i got stiletto nails and she did them very good shes also has an awesome personality youll love her im going to be a long term customer the atmosphere is very modern but relaxing i highly recommend this place go to christy came here a couple days ago through a recommendation upon entry i was immediately greeted and had my name put down on their list the place was full and very busy however according to the guy that didnt my nails joe was his name i believe this was one of their slow days impressive ive never seen a nail salon so busy and ive been to quite a bit so if this was any indication of their service i was excited to see the end result i opted for a mani pedi joe was very entertaining and even made conversation which is nice he even helped me decide what color to go with im giving it stars because there was a noticeable small bulge in my pinky and he didnt fix it but it was probably because there was a long line of waiting customers so i didnt get too upset about that will definitely come back a five star nail service yet to find one in los angeles i walked in and was taken the best care of by mai yes the salon is very busy and loud but who cares when the result in my case gel polish is so flawless i normally do my own nails at home but i had a friend in town to help me with wedding dress fittings im getting married and i thought it would be nice to get ourselves pampered a little the salon is pretty and i had been there a couple of times before i wasnt overly impressed or disappointed before so i took my friend to give it another try they caused my fiance to bleed during his first pedi ever after this visit however i will never go back there again i understand people have bad days but kelly was extremely impatient and short with me i asked if she knew any good designs for wedding nails and she just insisted that i pick my color myself embarrassed and shocked i just asked her to do a nude color and i would accent it later with nail art she then insisted that i try a different nude than the one i selected more pinkish but i didnt like it i was trying not to be rude so i tried to whisper to my friend to ask her opinion kelly overheard and got upset and proceeded to remove the color while raising her voice and almost throwing things around this made me very uncomfortable she proceeded with painting my nails with the color i selected in complete silence my friend had trish working on her after the kelly incident occurred trish began making small talk and asked me where i was from i told her my origin and she proceeded to say oh thats why you skin is a muddy color i have to say ive never been so insulted and uncomfortable ive been all around the world grew up outside of the us and ive never experienced anything as uncultured ignorant or rude i asked for the owners information but somehow im never able to get in contact with him or receive a call back i feel that he should know how these ladies are treating his customers nobody deserves that kind of service especially not for the prices that they charge i have never done this before but i will be filing a complaint with the bbb racism is not ok this was my first time at diamond nails i had done extensive research because i never get my nails done except special occasions becuase i will just bite them off but i am having my engagement pictures taken and i want my hand to look nice i made an appointment and showed up early only to be told my tech was an hour behind my options were to wait or go with a different tech i chose to go for the different tech and she started with my pedicure it was amazing i am a runner so i have gross feet but they feel amazing now i was very happy when they started my full set and gel polish then i was changed to a different tech because my pedicure tech had another appointment nd change despite having an appointment now phil is working on my nails he asked my length and shape and i said i am more comfortable with short nails and i wanted them round phil begins and he cuts the nail way too long again i never get my fingernails done so long nails are really hard for me then he told me longer nails would make my fingers look skinnier i still asked for shorter nails but he insisted this was better he gave me square nails when i pointed this out he said they were better for my look phil did a good job on the rest of my nails but would not listen to anything i wanted he also made very rude comments about my like choices overall i gave stars because my feet feel amazing and my fiance said my nails looked nice lack of customer service was disappointing especially when i made the appointment and they did not honor it i will most likely not return unless i am just getting a pedicure after my experience at polished i found diamond and i was exceedingly happy its been some time since ive moved away but im back for a week and i cant wait for my visit ive never had a pedicure before so my girlfriend took me it was amazing tweety was great the hot stone massage really topped it off im already looking forward my next visit great staff great service christy is amazing ive been loyal for over two years by far the best quality in town found this place on yelp and it was not a regret this place seemed very busy so i called in to check if there was any opening the same day and there was i was able to get me my sister and cousin in at pm i was running late but i was able to call them and let them know and it was no problem going in at pm i arrive around pm and it was packed i thought we would have to wait a long time but minutes later we sat on a chair my nail tech was awesome her name is lucy i sat down and told her i want the coffin nail shape and she knew right away what it was i didnt have to show her any picture which is a bonus i wasnt sure what if i wanted nude or white nails so she gave my alot of options for different color choices in gel she was super friendly and talkative i love nail techs who talk and she loved to talk she was funny and did my nails very well price i paid for my nails was total here is the break down full acrylic set gel polish shaping of nails christy is great its down to earth and fun there busy but they take their time and do a good job make an appointment this way you get seen what time you want got a pedicure and gel manicure they have tons of colors from bright to light they have glitter galore been to another salon and i felt rushed not here oh and bring cash for tip i didnt know but most salons like it my best friend and i went there for their chocolate champagne pedicure we had an appt at pm we were there on time and only waited minutes the people there were very friendly helpful and funny we were seated and immediately given very chilled champagne that was delicious we had a wonderful experience there and i would love to have a place like that in los angeles i loved this place i found it because i was looking for shops that were open late but everything in my neighborhood closed at pm i was able to do a walk in here around pm for a manipedi after i was seated in a pedicure chair they gave me a menu of their specials some of which even include champagne chocolate covered strawberries and ice cream i chose the hot stone treatment but was asked if i wanted the hot stones or an extra minutes of massage instead i chose the massage joseph was my artist and he did such an amazing job that i was starting to doze off then the owner took josephs place to finish me off with a manicure and he did a great job my hands and feet look beautiful everyone was really friendly and they delivered excellent service despite being pretty crowded i will be coming here from now on very pretty salon along with tons of gel colors to choose from fun environment good music always playing just an overall good experience ive had my nails done by trish and mai and they are both excellent i always leave there very happy with my nails been here times so i think ive had enough services to write a review wendy and andrew are great at acrylics fast and precise some of the techs are a little to comfortable and the ay they talk is a little unprofessional a times but everyone there is cool they are all americanized and completely understand what youre saying which is a relief they dont upsale too much all in all theyre a good salon i normally dont write reviews on places like this that ive only been to once but since im from out of town i thought that i should give them one anyway this place is awesome i had phillip do my gel manicure and pedicure and im not lying when i say that ive never had anyone do such a good job he really took his time to make them perfect and didnt make me feel rushed this salon plays current music which i like since most places have sports playing which drives me nuts i really like that this place is overall very social everyone here speaks good english and is very friendly when i come back to vegas i definitely know where i will be getting my nails done im addicted to this place i love my girl melissa she is so good at reading through my confusion and helping me pick out the colors the best suit what i am looking for i find myself coming in to see her quite regularly the facility is super clean and all the technician speak english in front of you they do a great job of getting you seated and serviced quickly i never feel rushed i feel like the atmosphere is relaxing and friendly this is definitely my new spot i have chosen to give stars for multiple reasons the first time i came was great the polish looked wonderful gel lasted a while and people were super nice the stars come from my most recent experience i got a pedi and gel mani going on vacation i was so excited to have beautiful nails that lasted as long as the first time those hopes shattered or should i say chipped within days gel i went to get them fixed with no charge great job to them the next day that same nail and the next chipped i havent been doing anything strenuous im beyond disappointed that in a week i have had gel nails chip this badly especially before my trip what a disappointment for the money spent between service and tip the first time and tip for the first fix my regular polished toes in flip flops are holding up better than these terrible gel fingers so sad i have not made up my mind if ill be back its too expensive for the quality in my opinion at the moment bummer this was my first time here and it will also be my last i havent done my nails in so long because money is tight right now but i just went through something really rough so my husband told me to treat myself i got a deluxe pedicure but there was nothing deluxe about it the massage sucked and the whole pedicure lasted only about mins i initially told my technician deanna that i wanted red or nude since im pretty simple but i saw her nails and she had white with a little silver sparkle on top i liked it so i asked for that through the pedicure i was wrapped up in my phone but when i looked down my nails were completely silver she said it would better from far she was sweet but i am so unhappy i hate it and i paid i feel worse than i went in i used to come here religiously but each time my nails ended up worse and worse ive had my acrylic gels for about three weeks now and they have all lifted i dont do any strenuous work so im unsure why they lifted also three days after my nails were done i had to go back since they had bubbles appear on them i called and made an appointment that morning but i was still given a hard time by the unpleasant receptionist who didnt really know what she was doing i had to ask for the owners number until she finally sat me down i loved this place but i guess once they get used to you their quality begins to fade i have been to this salon about times and i always have left happy i have seen lily and andrew both amazing i went in yesterday and saw andrew and left with my nails looking on point i usually get square acrylic nails but i wanted a change and asked him if we can change my current set into a natural almond shape and he said yes i left the salon super happy and kept looking at my nails hes also super funny they all are and i like the fact that of the time they are speaking to each other in english usually places i go they speak in their own language and i feel awkward i recommend this place to everyone thank you andrew the nicest people here i went here to get a design on my nail fixed that i got done somewhere else and sam was happy to help and made me feel very welcome i will definitely be back and highly recommend anyone to come here great people and they do amazing nails what a great nail salon i always walk in and get an appointment right away everyone is accommodating and the energy is always great andrew always does such an awesome job on my nails have been going to this salon for a few months now the staff is great especially trish she is awesome and does a wonderful job consistently wont go anywhere or to anyone else best place ever mai is the best ask for her i refer a lot of people they always have great things to say the owner sam is great and mumma and papa who help are the sweetest people my nails last four weeks they offer great pedicure options busy but great nail salon lucy was super amazing go see melissa for your nail designs she is amazing just show her a design that youll like and she will make it happen shes really good at what she does and super friendly looking forward to seeing her again soon andrew and winnie are the best i have gone here off and on for over four years and have finally found the perfect fit my daughter and i go together to have mother daughter time and winnie always takes suck great care of her and is so patient words of advice this nail salon is in high demand so if you want an amazing experience schedule your appointment ahead of time i also believe you should tip your nail tech well you get what you pay for andrew and winnie thank you for taking such great care of my daughter and i the first time i visited this place i waited about half an hour before i was called back to get my pedicure i was pretty annoyed by the wait but my pedicure was done to my satisfaction i made a mental note to make an appointment the next time when i went back the second time i made an appointment and my experience was much better there was no longer a wait time and other than the nail lady scraping underneath my nail too hard the experience was good the third time i went i made an appointment and requested trish to do my nails trish is the best she really takes the time to make sure everything is perfect i requested a design to be done in gel and she painstakingly perfect every line and coated each nail to make sure i had the look i wanted i called diamond nails spa at this morning to see if i could book noon pedicures for myself and a friend they were able to fit us in even though i had called last minute everyone at the nail salon was so nice and accommodating and the prices were very reasonable when we were about to leave the salon my friend noticed that she had accidentally smudged her polish although her nail technician was busy at the time the tech stopped what she was doing to fix my friends nails the level of service provided was just excellent if we are ever in vegas again we will stop back at this nail salon what a awesome experience i highly recommend going to christy she is the best all around she is very fast and very talented at helping design exactly what you want in your nails and at the same time she has you laughing the whole time its was my best experience with a salon here i ive had here in vegas thankyou chrisy diamond nails amazing the owners are always there working hard and do a great job of running the place smoothly the staff is very professional kind etc and the best part for me and my hubby is that we feel comfortable weve been to many many salons and the way the staffdynamicatmosphere just made us uncomfortable in many ways but not here we just moved from florida and have been looking for a nail salon to regularly go to and we are very happy to have found our spot my girly is christy shes a great girl with a bubblyedgy personality and does great work shes a lot of fun and ill be going to her every time thanks christy i wish i could give stars we called trying to get an apt since we needed to come at night they said they were not busy and we didnt need an apt i was so disappointed we waited with no help for min just soaking when we started to leave no one even said anything to us we drove down the road to elaines nails and got service with a smile i wish i could give zero stars wow what an awful first experience too bad they are so close to my house but i will never go there again bottom line i called at pm tonight to make an appointment i was told no appointment was necessary so i showed up at they were actually a little busy for a monday night but i put my name down and waited i was sat in a chair at and my feet sat in water for min with no sign of anyone coming to service me so i left they didnt say a peep as i walked out and drove min away to elaines nails on durango and flamingo where i was immediately seen andrew and winnie are the best i have gone here off and on for over four years and have finally found the perfect fit my daughter and i go together to have mother daughter time and winnie always takes suck great care of her and is so patient words of advice this nail salon is in high demand so if you want an amazing experience schedule your appointment ahead of time i also believe you should tip your nail tech well you get what you pay for andrew and winnie thank you for taking such great care of my daughter and i andrew is gone so i went to mai and boy am i even happier she is the bomb picture to follow love my nails and color amazing melissa is the best they offer such a variety of services and their pedicures are one of a kind i will never go anywhere else this was my to go spot with the exemption of trying out one or two other salons when i first started coming here hanna was taking care of me and she was just awesome couple other people i talked to at the salon loved her as well but she is not there any more one day i just walked in no appointment and had ok experience then i heard i should always make appointment with james and i started doing so andrew was also doing my nails once both of them are great although with james you get that exceptional service where he besides doing your nails perfectly makes that connection and does really nice massages but the last time i did not have appointment and i just walked in i do not know the name of the lady who did my nails but after choosing the gel color she asked me probably times during my pedicure if i wanted same color on my hands and i said yes every time after she was done with my pedicure she sat me with a different lady to do my manicure and she told me she is out of that color i wouldnt be upset if i wasnt asked so many times before that if i wanted the same color on the end rd person finished my nails scraping color of the walls of the bottle to make me happy but days later of my nails were chipped which never happened before i appreciate their attempt to make me happy but i am also disappointed for not getting same quality each time or same quality from different people make your reservations with people you trust so you know what to expect their booking online sucks or better yet the person in charged of confirming the appointment sucks i came in for my appointment that i booked online the paris hilton looked alike receptionist told me that i have no appointment i showed her the email i got confirming my appointment she said oh you didnt get my email that i denied it well ill send it then there goes the email hmmm is that for formality sake my dear moral of the story dont rely on their online booking better call to confirm great nail salon staff is very friendly helpful and courteous phillip is the best nail tech in town i read the reviews and had to try this place out i have always gone to my usual place but i really wanted to try something new when i walked it the location was open and inviting they have two sections because they expanded it was a really modern feeling i got sat down immediately and i was there for a fill i saw down and got melissia she immdiately atarted working on my nails and chatting with me i havent had many technicians talk to me and it was really nice i picked out a light color and my nails came out amazing i will be back again and definitely going to melissa ive been a customer of this salon since and it is by far my favorite trish is the best i have been here twice neither time was a good experience the first time i sat in the pedicure bowl for minutes before the nail tech came i would have walked out but i was leaving town in the morning so i needed my nails done in my most recent visit i came in with no appointment pm for a manipedi the salon is open until pm the whole time i felt so uncomfortable because my nail tech kept making comments about how she has to stay at work so long and she was rushing through my manicure i could tell she didnt want to do my pedicure even after the front desk girl told her she set up the pedi bowl my nail tech finished my manicure and told me to have a good night and filled out the ticket slip for me to pay i wasnt going to push it i didnt want to give this place anymore of my money my manicure came out okay but not the worthy i absolutely love that they are open late but i will never go back and i definitely will not recommend the salon my new go to spot conviently located between two of my fav restaurants i am loving their new extended hours i get off work at and still have plenty of time to get my nails done before they close up shop i dont have a go to nail technician yet but i like being assisted by different girls until i find one i really like so far each person i have gone to has done a really great job i feel the prices are reasonable for the service and experiance highly recommend this shop i used to come here for pedicures but recently decided to get acrylic extensions and let me tell you they are gorgeous wendi did a phenomenal job perfect length perfect color so very happy thank you so these guys dont know how to confirm appointments theyre always losing appointments understaffed always double booking and so on im been a loyal customer for the last year and a half and in the course of months they lost my appointments the first time i let it slide and i always pre book my next appointment ugh if it wasnt for my nail technician id be down the next salon these guys need to get their act together with confirming appointments like txt reminders or simple common courtesy phone calls sometimes i just want to video the person that create the appointments now i have to reschedule just to get my nails done horrible customer service ive been going to this nail salon for years and most of the nail techs not all does an excellent job i always go to mai and let me tell you she is the bombdotcom she is very precise and her nail designsart are her work of perfection she never cease to amaze me every time she does my nails their customer service is not the greatest most especially their scheduling system theyve lost my appointment double booked booked with the wrong technician etc just today i called to make an appointment and i specifically asked for mai and i was told that she had an opening today which was surprising because shes always booked i came in and i was told that shes on vacation however i was still scheduled for today but only with a different nail tech obviously who ever booked my appointment did not have his full attention on me thankfully the lady who did my nail was ok their online booking is not good either they would have a time slot available but its not really available im not a big fan of the owner either he only greetsconverse with a selected few customers whom i call his favorites ultimately i would suggest that you book an appointment even though they suck at it otherwise you would be waiting for a very long time they did an amazing job my mom and i went in for full sets we made appointments and had no issues we were in an out in an hour we had yuki and winnie winnie was a sweet heart and i was able to pull up a photo of what i wanted just a heads up though they charge for length and shape awesome place to get your nails done friendly staff and accommodate walk ins very relaxing especially when they massage your feet and legs i really enjoy the deluxe pedicure its and very much worth it oh and they are open late till pm love this place and highly recommend it i dont usually do nail salons skeptical of sterilization diamond nails spa did a great job on manis and pedis for me and my daughter soooo satisfied wish you were here in chicago but its worth coming to vegas for great staff great service great price the massage therapy was the best thanks stacey is so amazing they had my cousin and i sit down immediately after picking out our polish stacey has very nice strong hands and made me feel relaxed right away i love the massage

her work and a very good masseuse after my gel mani i was tired of boring nails but i didnt want anything too busy anne recommended one nail gold and a gold jewel on the others it might sound busy but its classic i love it service at this place is great im in love with the pampering treatment they are above the rest im definitely going to come back and try the chocolate pedicure this is my nd time here and ann is my girl shes passionate about her work and a very good masseuse after my gel mani i was tired of boring nails but i didnt want anything too busy anne recommended one nail gold and a gold jewel on the others it might sound busy but its classic i love it service at this place is great im in love with the pampering treatment they are above the rest im definitely going to come back and try the chocolate pedicure came to get my nails done for my engagement party and i am absolutely in love with how they turned out nina is so amazing and would recommend her to everyone love this place reasonably priced open late very clean and great free amenities while you get your nails done i got the best massage at diamond nails ive never had a better massage anywhere only fifty dollars for a full hour by a true professional if you have back problems you should make an appointment you wont be sorry p s my girl an works at diamond nails she is the best nail tech in the whole world really shes great i had the best experience with christy she was able to fix my bad set of nails in no time shes fantastic came here for a gel pedicure and was really only concerned about the polish change i wanted the express pedi which was only the lady up selled me to a deluxe pedi theyre so good at that because its better and does more anyway great service julie was my nail technician and she did a wonderful job shes a perfectionist but thats not a bad thing at all when it comes to beauty services she messed up on my big toes and immediately scraped off the polish without question and redid then i appreciate her needs for customer satisfaction because im sure other people would have just let it go and cross their fingers customers wouldnt notice only dinged off one star due to the price when i paid i was shocked my total was and of course i tip well so end total was i asked why because the deluxe pedi was listed as apparently they charge an additional for gel polish whoa again great people and quality service but theres a place i regularly go to up north that only charges for a gel pedi and saving is something to me p the service is fast and efficient the staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable i chose this place based on their reviews and was not disappointed thank goodness i found lana i have finally found my home salon and a technician who is professional meticulous and friendly to boot i love that she pays attention and really provides such excellent service the quality of work is consistent and always top notch whether it is for pedicures or gel manicures i can rely on her for a great job no matter what service i choose with her thank you lana i look forward to making my appointments with you best nail place cindy is amazing nina did my nails it was a great experience and she took time to make them look great just now getting to my review came in saturday for a gel polish change was greeted by the nice receptionist and told it would be a min wait she also said the gel polish change would be i waited about min before stacey called me she was so sweet she asked about the color i wanted which was shining armor she couldnt find it on the sample rack apparently that meant she couldnt put that color on me fine i picked a different color illuminate or something like that before she began i clearly stated that my nails are soft and bend easily so i wanted a hardener on them well she didnt listen or understand or something because about hours later my nail broke when i went to pay stacey told the receptionist it was a gel mani all she did was take my old gel off put the new gel on and then she rubbed lotion on my hands for seconds or less each hand so my grand total with a tip was it was my fault for not paying more attention to what she was doing since i was holding my infant daughter on my lap anyway its now wednesday afternoon and i have another nail thats about to break off if bond a nail lounge wouldnt have closed i would have beautiful nails today i have our annual family photoshoot friday and i suppose ill have to hide my broken index finger nail im still willing to go in again to see if they can redeem themselves im going there for about a year and the place is great i just tried melissa weeks ago and definately i loved her work untill now i was seeing another woman from there she was good too but i needed a change and melissa made it worth she is just so serious about her work and also talented has a lot of patience and is a perfectionist love it service is amazing its just unfortunate they have no set prices i paid for a pedicure and fill with one gel color in the past i paid for gel color and rockstar same exact thing minus the glitter this time and some how it ended up being more not sure how that works great work and even better customer service love that this place closes at but i love that the owner is so nice and personable not like going to polished where they make you feel like they are doing you a favor ive been here numerous times i dont think ive ever once had the same person but ive never had a bad experience here anytime i have friends in town i take them here for pedis theyre quick and friendly although i was very disappointed and suprised at my latest visist last sunday when two of techs got into an argument right in front of their customers even after the male tech walked away the female tech kept bitching to her coworker and to her customer about the situation talking smack about the other tech very unprofessional and definitely made the visit a little akward i went there last night for my first time ever and sat with trish i am going to be maleficent for halloween so i wanted some themed nails trish was amazing and the job she did on my nails is flawless she more then met my expectations took her time and did a fantastic job i will definitely be coming back to her if you are looking for a cool design i would highly recommend trish she is also very sweet and funny my two little girls love my nails and are so jealous i did not take them with me this place is amazing i go once a week to see lana and am always delighted not only us the salon clean beautiful and impeccably run the tool try use come out of sterile packs and all of the employees go out of their way to make sure your happy even if youre not their client lana does my nails and i really dont even have to tell her anything but a small idea she takes it from there we sit and talk catch up on the week and next thing you know my nails looks like i could be a hand model this is truly a diamond in the rough i will never go anywhere else as long as i am in las vegas obsessed with trish she does an amazing job every time i see her i always leave here very pleased i came here a while back to get my nails done along with a pedicure i dont normally get my nails done on a regular basis but i was getting myself prepared to go overseas on vacation and i wanted everything to look perfect i did some research asked my friends for their opinions and eventually settled down on diamond nails spa not only that i had my eyes set on james i wanted him to do my nails due to all the reviews about his great work making the reservation was hard yet easy at the same time the process of making a reservation is easy you can call or book online however james is quite popular not only that but his schedule ends at pm his last appointment has to be at pm with me going to work from am to pm it was a risk but i had to take it james is a very pleasant person to talk to you can tell him what you want or an idea and he can follow through with it he will stop in the middle of doing your nails to make sure that it is to your preferences i ended getting something fairly simple i got a no chip manicure aka gel manicure i wanted a gradient design a white tip fading into clear i also got it with glitter on top i loved the design and how he did my nails everything was so shiny and pretty it looked reminded me of winter i just wished the white was a little more prevalent at the tips so you can tell but thats fine also this manicure lasted forever people even thought that they looked fake there were no chips or cracks for at least a month it survived a vacation and then some perrrrrfeccttt it was a pain to take the polish off myself though regardless i would definitely come here again for the gel manicure when looking for a nail salon would you rather have cheap poor quality or normal price with the quality of celebrities if you want great quality come here never disappointed when i get my nails done they are all fantastic with phenomenal customer service skills the owner is amazing when youre done with the service youll walk out with a good feeling you will want to come back diamond nail spa is a wonderful salon very sanitary the atmosphere is just awesome you wont regret coming here i absolutely love this place i have been coming here from the start they never fail to amaze me usually i have james the bald guy w the tattoos assist me hes great super artistic to the point where i always tell him to surprise me now hes never failed me the only problem is that hes so good that you have to book with him in advance because hes always booked because of that i have worked with several other of their employees all which who are great i personally have made a great friendship with james so i prefer him sam who is the owner is so welcoming they are always so friendly always make sure i feel comfortable at home theyve created such a great environment here i hope they never leave its more than just getting your nails done here its an experience with these people my mother also goes here sometimes steals james away from me she too is in love with this place the people she also loves getting massages she has gone everywhere but says the best one she has ever gotten was here by carmelita i totally recommend this place great talent great environment great people this place is awesome everyone is so nice and christy did a really good job and was quick she was also very personable i saw the other ladies work too on other girls nails which were also really pretty if i could give this place negative stars i would the customer service is absolutely awful i got my nails done here and i was not happy with them at all the gel was put on very thin and you could still see through places my nails even with the dark polish i called twice to make sure it was ok if i came in to have them add two more coats of polish and they said yes that it wasnt a problem when i arrived the receptionist asked one of the nail techs is she could take care of me and her response was um no im not fixing her nails right in front of me when someone finally helped me and i explained to her again what my issue was she told me that that was impossible to do and they were going to charge me to fix my nails mind you the first person who did my nails was the owner of the salon this was the worst customer service experience that i have ever had and will never go back nina did my nails it was a great experience and she took time to make them look great i was referred here by another customer so i thought i would give it a try i was looking to get a full set and a pedicure when i showed up i didnt have an appointment but i was seen immediately so this was a plus my pedicure looks great and my nails look ok nina was my tech and she was friendly enough i am giving it stars bc i had multiple pictures of what i wanted and overall i got pretty damn close to what i wanted but not exactly what i wanted again with all the pics i had this shouldnt have been an issue also there was a comment that nina made that i didnt like when she asked about my pedicure i told her truthfully it looked great it really did my feet normally look like frodos so i was really liking my pretty pedicure then after she put the set of nails on my hands hadnt shaped filed anything yet just cut to the length i wanted she asked if i liked it and i said i did i mean what else could i say it wasnt the finished product but i was liking it so far and this was the comment she made that rubbed me the wrong way so you just like everything i do huh but she said it almost mocking me like making fun because im friendly i guess i just laughed it off and said well i guess so so after that i just sat there and made no effort at small talk maybe she wanted me to be a bih well sweetheart your wish is my command i went here for a nail emergency meaning i bit off almost all of my acrylic nails again do not ask me how i did it to all my nail biting ladies out there do not do it getting acrylic nails off of your fingernails was torturous trust me i already did the leg work i called the salon and did not ask for anyone in particular i was surprised that i got an appointment with james i learned from yelp that james is one of the best if not the best i was so excited to meet him he welcomed me and was super accommodating and understanding he tried his best to not make the process hurt me too much which i greatly appreciate he is an expert at what he does and it is apparent in the way he handles his client i highly recommend this establishment they charged fairly for high quality work ive been to other nail salons that are expensive but just could not deliver the way this place did ive been going to this salon for years now when i first moved to vegas i would use any nail technician but i use my nails a lot to open bottles in the nightclub i work at they kept breaking i went to a nail technician named trish to fix them and i loved the way she did my nails that was a year ago ive been using trish since they have a variety of nudes light pinks whites for ladies that work in clubs but also so many other beautiful bright gel colors to choose from as well im on my feet in heels for work all night and i look forward to trishs pedicures every other week so much she gives the best massages i highly encourage getting the hot stone massage with a pedicure trish is so pleasant fun to talk to shes also really hard working will work around my schedule any time i need to come in to see her she makes herself available ive tried numerous nail salons in vegas this is the best one with the most talented staff i like it here because they use sterilized equipments for each person gel nails look good not thick like ive had in previous service love them sometimes i cant book appointment in advance bc of my job but they always do their best to make space for you i just moved from california so im in desperate need to find a new nail technician thats as great as mines back in the bay lets break down my first experience at diamond for a gel mani and regular polish pedi entrance no wait was asked to sign in and pick a color immediately seated the receptionist introduced me to my technician lynh and asked if the spa water temperature was fine an introduction was a first for me pedicure all tools appeared sanitized and individually packaged from other tools the spa chair was not already turned on for massage in fact i couldnt locate the remote the technician groomed my nails just the length and shape to my liking and tended to my dry cracked heels although she cut my cuticle on my big toe she apologized and was gentle around the sensitive area the deluxe pedi was relaxing and much needed definitely get your worth the masque left my feet tingling for a good minutes she initiated conversation unlike others ive gotten my nails done by gel mani i didnt catch the technicians name she appeared young maybe s i showed her a picture of a design that i wanted and she did her absolute best to achieve it she was very gentle and took her time with my nails the gel mani with design was a little pricey for me but i was happy with my nails in the end for gel for design she did however cut my thumb cuticle a little short i didnt even notice until i got in my car its not as bad as my big toe the gel manicure is detailed and clean not messy with residue along the cuticles i give them stars because the cut cuticles and slightly high prices this is by far the best nail salon i have ever been to the staff are very friendly and james is amazing i have been here several times always extremely impressed and very happppyyyy with the outcome they have tons and tons of gel colors to choose from its hard to decide so i normally go mins prior to my appointment because im so indecisive the salon is very nice and clean and i feel very comfortable here you can make appointment or walk in but i suggest making appointment because they seem pretty busy most of the time i love this place and will never go anywhere else best nail salon ive been to its pretty out of my way from work home but so worth coming here to get my nails done i always get gel manipedis and a gel mani from here will last me a month when at other places my nails start chipping at about weeks the gel color selection is amazing so much to choose from and they have a ton of opi its for a basic gel mani and i believe also for a basic gel pedi pretty standard prices but when you factor in how long theyll last you its a really great deal every technician whos worked with me has been great as well theyre all very accommodating the salon is huge but it fills up pretty quickly and has always been busy when ive gone i usually make appointments but the longest ive had to wait without one is about minutes i loveeee that theyre open until pm since i dont get off from work until or later its super convenient ive been coming to diamond for three years now and absolutely love it all the staff is friendly and helpful i love that i can walk in and they address me by my name and even know my mothers name as well i never make an appointment due to my crazy work and school schedule and never have an issue getting in i am positive that i have had every nail tech and they are all wonderful not to mention the ambiance of diamond is so relaxing it definitely is not like you average nail salon in vegas they have a wide range of colors including true match which i always love nothing but the best here this was my first time and i was supposed to have an appointment with a different person but in the mix up i got melissa best mix up ever because she is amazing not only are my nails perfect but she has an awesome personality very sweet and outgoing i will definitely be back on a friday night i searched google for nail salons near me open late and diamond nails was a suggestion i looked at the review on yelp and called right away to my surprise they were open till pm thats such a relief since i work long days i made an appointment for a full set acrylic and pedicure im so glad i made that appointment because it was jam packed when i showed up christy was my nail technician we hit it off immediately christy was hilarious and i felt very comfortable with her her work is impeccable and was able to recreate a nail design i had been wanting to get done for a long time she mentioned that shes been doing nails for over years and it shows thank you diamond nails and christy i will definitely be back i really cant praise this place enough i walked in at on a busy tuesday night and they were able to take me in right away kandee sp welcomed me and asked what id like i showed her the picture and what colors and she helped me until we got exactly what i wanted she was so friendly and so talented and worked fast i loved it the salon was clean roomy even with how full busy it was and there were tvs for entertainment the prices were extremely reasonable and just wow wont go anywhere else this is my go to spot to get my nails done its a min drive from my house but well worth the trip i never use to make appointments with anyone specific but it didnt matter because everyone is fantastic ive recently found wendy who does a fantastic job shes really good at designs look at my christmas ones i wont go anywhere else but here the salon is clean and tidy and the ladies are friendly and i wont go to anyone but candy shes so sweet funny and shes a perfectionist with how my nails look i went somewhere else a few months ago to get my natural nails shaped into almonds and two of them were uneven candy didnt allow that she looked at them from every angle to make sure they were even shes amazing i highly recommend her let me start off by saying this salon was dirty and disorganized spa chairs facing left and right remotes on the pedicure spa were broken and the chairs were very old and it was just plain gross on the upside they serve champagne and theyre chocolate pedicure lasted two hours and was around it was probably the best pedicure ive probably ever had with the exception of the cleanliness and structure of the staff my mom and i drove hours to the las vegas airport and made an appt here to get a mani pedi before our flight we had plenty of time to relax and grab a bite before heading to the airport after our appt until we got here and found out we would be charged more because our appt was after pm it would have been nice to know about this when we called to make the appt we asked about the extra fee being waived because of our lengthy drive and not being told about the fee at all the receptionist told us we would need to ask the owner who was standing right next to her on the phone when he ended his call he disregarded us and didnt acknowledge us at all he then turned on his heel and headed straight to the back of the salon we asked the receptionist to ask the owner about this again and she returned to tell us that he would not waive the fee not only was he rude not to address us this salon is the only one we found in the surrounding area that even imposes a fee like this las vegas is a hour town and almost everything is open just as long for him to think the services offered at his salon deserve a self imposed after hours fee is something i dont care to find out im not going to this nail salon ever again i have a picture that i want my nails to look like i told this girl to make my pedi in regular french but she didnt do french then she used the machine to get my gel nails off when i was still in the pedicure seat my sweater got dirty i asked her to fix my two thumbs she put fake nail and acrylic it was messy there are some acrylic stuck behind my nails they dont even have the right rhinestone that i want so many errors i gave them my last chance always perfection i am able to drop in or call for an appointment within min and i am able to get in every time i have seen several techs and each time i am equally pleased stacey is my favorite and was super excited my last visit to see she is back i love how the owner is so hands on and knows so many clients by name the establishment is super clean which is obviously so important i have been a client for almost years and even though there are a dozen places closer to me i will stick with them first time here decided to get my nails done somewhere new since i just moved to this part of town was seen in about mins of signing in and was helped by a woman with short hair and cute tattoos she was sweet and helpful my nail technicians name was cindy and she was great talked in english nearly the whole time and didnt do that awkward no english phase as done in other nail salons i was very satisfied with my nails and will be back my full gel set with custom design was but the only reason i did not give stars was the cleanliness issue i did not like the fact that there were finger nail dust all over the work station when it was my turn to be seen had an amazing experience hanna did my nails and did such an amazing job im usually so scared to get my nails filed with an electric file but she was so gentle my hands didnt even sweat this time lol i was very comfortable the receptionist was so nice my pedicure was amazing i drove from nellis air force base just to get my nails done here because my friend recommended it and it was worth and i will be going back my mom and i flew in from the east coast right after the blizzard so getting our nails done was a top priority we made an impromptu appt at diamonds and they got us in immediately trischa and candy were the best candy did my nails and was extremely professional and patient she did an ombre that was the prettiest that i had seen anywhere trischa did my moms nails and they are really nice looking she also kept us in stitches the whole while but her level of expertise did not waver the cost was what we were use to paying so there were no surprises there all and all we had an excellent experience at diamond nails i definitely will visit when i fly back to vegas in october i keep writing reviews for this place only because its my nail spot n sam knows minutes from home and their nail technicians always exceeds my expectation i love that i get exactly what i want on my nails today yuki who has done my nails a couple times prior just blew me away w her art i showed her what i want and she delivers i love it favorite nail spot also get me in and out clean and friendly location is close by my house owners are always there and welcome you with a smile got my nails done today and loved the job christy did on my nails definitely will be back i dont usually get my nails done but i randomly got an urge for a manipedi i chose this place because theyre open until and i get off work relatively late i didnt have an appointment but i walked in around it was pretty busy but i probably only waited minutes before i got started i can count the times ive gone to a salon in my life mainly because im embarrassed of my hands i have these wretched horizontal ridges on my thumbnails and they look awful the gentleman doing my nails noticed them and asked if i wanted him to fix them for more and i agreed and he actually fixed them i wish i had gotten his name but he did such a great job they look like smooth normal healthy nails now im so excited that i had to post a review immediately i enjoyed my manicure and pedicure and will be back again i would definitely recommend this place came here for a french tip with a pointy nail and total was the work itself wasnt bad at all i actually really liked the way my nails came out but the lady who did my nails stopped to eat a chocolate halfway through doing my nails lol im not a picky person but it just felt weird overall i would come here again just because they are open late ive always had good experiences here but today was such a disappointment i came in for a pedicure with my husband for an early valentines day treat my pedicure took less than minutes i basically soaked for minutes got a short massage and then he painted my nails no scrub or anything my nail tech did a sloppy job with my polish and kept having to correct his work and was continuously and uncomfortably scratching me with his nail to remove the polish from my cuticle after my pedicure was finished my husband was only halfway into his since we came in together i stayed sitting in the massage chair next to him waiting for him to be done after about minutes of waiting i was told to go to the dryer to let my toes dry the whole point was to come in and spend time together it has now been minutes since i was asked to move from the massage chair and my husband is still getting his pedi we brought this up to the manager and he was apologetic and offered a discount which i appreciate but now we know that this is not the place to come to enjoy a pedicure together service was prompt while my friend had to wait minutes but for some reason my service cost more than hers and she got a hand arm massage we got the same hot stone pedicure package mine was over in minutes i also got hit with a charge for getting there past pm waited until the last minute to tell me and each service was an additional after tab i sat there for minutes while my friend had her nails done jeez i heard good things about this place and i hate leaving negative reviews but this was awful i came in yesterday for my first time i must say i like that a nail place is open on a sunday afternoon you are given a menu for all services they have i only got a pedicure its plain pedicure with absolutely nothing added no scrub hot towel or hot rocks ive been to other nail places that offer all that for i will return if i need a pedicure late in the evening or on a sunday quality work but terrible service i made an appointment to for a gel mani and a pedi at diamond nails but ran minutes late because of work the owner initially greeted me with a smile and then immediately looked disgusted not just slightly disappointed disgusted that i was late it doesnt matter if i was an hour late as a business you should never treat your paying customers poorly all customers have the capacity to promotedemote business by word of mouth and by yelp not to mention wouldnt you want to convert your customer into a returning customer the owner took two walk ins before he finally had me seated this meant a total of minutes not exaggerating of waiting that is ridiculous he didnt give me an estimate of how long i would have to wait either to add to that the owner personally started working on removing the gel polish of the walk in customer sitting next to me who was getting her pedi done at the same time i was there before her the aesthetician doing my manipedi did an excellent job though he was very detailed oriented service is important especially with so many nail places to choose from probably wont be returning here i couldnt be happier with the service i received tonight i called at pm to see if they had any openings since they were closing soon and was told to come right in the gentleman on the phone was very nice not a hint of oh great a last minute customer detected i was greeted immediately and told to pick a gel color they have hundreds to choose from i chose a glittery red my fave and was immediately directed to my seat my nail tech ann came to set me up right away she was charming and warm and really downright adorable she made conversation and really paid attention to the work she was doing heres the best part i used to get my nails done for years i stopped because i was tired of being cut every single time i got them done no matter the salon or the tech i used i always bled ann is so skilled in her craft that i not only left without a nick but i dont even have a sore spot on my cuticles hallelujah they are perfectly shaped evenly weighted and i cannot believe how great my hands look keep in mind this miracle happened mins before close im sure youve dealt with a nail tech in a rush i felt like i was anns first customer of the day i got a gel manicure which costs seriously thats a great deal for the quality and care ann showed ive never written a yelp review before but the service i received at diamond nails had to be recognized theyve gained a long term customer and ann has gotten a loyal regular they advertise that they open till pm but they wont take customers at if your not taking customers then why advertise that you open till pm false advertisement but yet you have workers sitting around doing nothing used to be my favorite place to go but they just lost my vote if i could i would rate this place with no stars the worst nail salon i have been too nails were put on crooked lumpy nail polish and the girl that did my nails didnt even do what i asked her too what a waste of im cosmetologist used to do nails for my clients always done gels on myself ive never treated myself to someone else doing my gels today was my st ann did a great job i made an appt the same day got taken back right away my friend also got a pedicure at the same time said it was the best one shes ever had ill def be doing a pedicure with my gel manicure next time finding a good nail salon is hard these days i know it was only my st time at diamond but they didnt let me down love this place can always walk in without appointment and all the nail techs are good came in town was visiting a friend and was in need of a fill manicure and pedicure i made an appointment day prior came in and was seated shortly after salon very clean and ran efficiently im used to great service i have a place i use back home in california but i was satisfied and impressed they had about employees all working with customers i had a technician named hannah and she was very detailed friendly and polite the place is very nice offers different package a bit pricey but its very nice and higher tech then normal small salons and i had no problem paying since in vegas i appreciated the decor and the service plus they had so many great gel colors to pick from please see hannah shes great just got a full set of acrylics from hannah and shes amazing i was finished before my mom who got a foot spa pedi great first time experience for acrylics i also asked her if i could go kung fu fighting with these babies on bottom line clean and friendly place must go on friday i called at pm and asked how much a pedicure was and was told so i asked can i be seen i came in twenty minutes later and the lady with short purple hair told me it would mins and i said no problem while im waiting a girl walked in to get her brows waxed and she asked her is it a more charge since after hours and she said no so then i see a sign saying its more after pm so when she came to get me i asked whats the charge she said oh after hours its extra plus extra for whatever reason i told her when i called you told me now your telling she said someone must of made a mistake i told her it was you cause i can tell by your voice and she said you must of called before i said no heres my phone look what time i called then she said well didnt you read the sign i said yes thats why im asking you i said it was your mistake so i think you should let me have a pedicure for but she wouldnt budge she said she couldnt and i could come back the next day when the price is really she didnt apologize or try and fix her mistake so i just left cause i was already irritated i did tell her just wait for your yelp review she wouldnt give me her name so i wouldnt post it on yelp but shes the only one with purple short hair at that nail salon came here last minute and had an amazing experience andy really took care of me and was so nice and attentive everyone enjoys working here and you can tell because of the service they provide come here if youre visiting lv totally worth it great experience was looking for a place open late so i can get my toes done after the kids go to bed this place is open until pm thanks for the great service ill definitely be returning i love having my nails done and pedicures here their facility is often busy and i would recommend making an appointment to avoid wait times but their staffs so friendly and caring so far i have had three different girls and one guy for either a pedicure or a full set of gel nail extensions and have had wonderful experiences theyre also open late until pm daily i believe so that is a plus ive came here before for a late pedicure and had a great experience this review however is about my nd visit here i came to this salon because i needed a last minute gel manicure and since this salon opens late i wouldnt feel too bad about walking in at pm i had the pleasure of getting a gel manicure done by christy as a walk in she has a big personality and is wittyfunny she works very fast which has its pros and cons im sure i was her last client of the day as she removed my previous gel with the drill i was clinching to my seat the first fingers were extremely painful she had the drill on high and it was so hot on my nail i never felt that type of heatpain before during a manicure i didnt think it would keep happening so i didnt say anything at first after the rd finger in a row i let out a screech and she said sorry and was more careful after that my gel manicure looked great when she was finished but it didnt hold up as well as other gel manicures ive had done from different salons it lasted flawlessly for at least a week and then started chipping one by one after that overall i liked christy and i would still visit this salon again i like that they have late hours and that you can schedule appointments online this salon is big with quite a few stations i might want to try the massage services in the future new update i decided to give it another shot mainly because the shop is not n my way home and open late im so glad i did i have been going back for months now they certainly have won back a loyal customer thanks to andrew he is absolutely amazing hes knowledgable sweet cares about his customers and their happiness with his work he takes pride in what he does and is overall just a wonderful person i am so glad i found andrew here he has made me a loyal customer once again and he does such quality work do yourself a favor and go see andrew you will not be disappointed i recently moved to las vegas and needed to find a salon in blue diamond i can go on the regular stars for how fabulous this salon looks on the inside i was expecting my experience to be just as great unfortunately the service was disappointing i made an appointment minutes in advance for a pedicure and they suggest that i walked in instead since it wasnt busy as soon as i arrived the pedi section was full and they made me wait almost mins i figured making an appointment would avoid the wait but since they insisted i walked in it was a big hassle when i finally sat down for my pedi they made me wait another minutes for a nail tech this lady wasnt so accommodating i chipped my toe nail from a night out with friends the night before and the nail tech had a disgusted look on her face about how my toe nails were looking before she worked on them she made me feel embarrassed and uncomfortable to get them done by her the paint job wasnt that great and it only lasted days until it started chipping again smh it was very disappointing and a waste of time and money i wont be coming back to this place ive had a better experience for much less hasnt even been a week that i got nails done here and its already chipping i had told the lady from the begging that it looks like it was going to chip and she looked at me like if i was crazy and started laughing saying no i have been here three times but i am now looking for a new salon the technician trish i used did a good job but i cant take her attitude any more she was always texting walking off or talking with her pals the last time i was there she left me in the pedi chair disappeared when i was ready to leave i couldnt unlatch the arm no one was around to help especially no the technician i had to climb over the arm to get out time to find a new salon my sister and i had a pm appointment and set in water until the reception was the only good part she was extremely nice and apologetic but after sitting a long time and she being the only employee that acknowledged us we decided to leave we will not be back actually went to the other nail salon a few doors and received be the best service there was actually another customer that came in after us who left the diamond so they lost about in business between the of us made a pm appt with andrew for pink and white full set because this is one of the only salons that use tammy taylor pink acrylic i drove across town only to find out he called out would have been nice if they called me very disorganized the shop was a mess and the receptionist was overwhelmed and couldnt multitask she didnt even realize i left after when i asked if someone else could do my nails and she helped someone else and never got back to me huge disappointment convenient appointment making via website and friendly reminders via email and text to help me plan a mother daughter nail outing i treated my mom to a little pampering and im glad to find this nail salon we arrived a little early for our appointment and they took us right away the salon is huge and it was bustling on a saturday afternoon the nail techs made the extra effort to seat my mom and i next to each other i was helped my cindy and my mom had thuy they brought us water and made color suggestions for us we had a great time chatting and i was happy with the end results on our manicures i look forward to making this salon my regular place going forward cute nail shop with tons of stations and has extended hours have been coming here for several months always as a walk in and it never takes any longer than minutes to get in highly recommend the hot stone pedicure ive been coming here for about years now can honestly say no other nail shops in town compare before coming here i used to jump from shop to shop until i finally found diamond nails i literally havent been to another shop since i work front desk so my guests are constantly looking at my hands asking me where i get my nails done im proud to refer this shop to any everyone james trish have never let me down are always super patient considering i bring my year old daughter with me love this place i basically snapped my nail in half and needed a place that was open late so that i could get it fixed before work the next morning i showed up around pm and only waited about minutes the lady who helped me was so so nice and she was very gentle now i cant tell that my nail was ever broken she even matched the color to the rest of my nails exactly would definitely recommend i absolutely love james best in the building just remember you will likely either not get an answer when you call to make an appointment or be left on hold for minutes terrible reception oh and if you want a particular color be sure to call ahead of time because although they may have the color on their display they could be out of it in stock i did my nails for prom here and they came out amazing just what i asked for winnie did a fantastic job doing my glitter ombre nails defiantly going back soon i seriously wanted cry when i had to pay dollars plus tip for a gel manicure and regular pedicure that is ridiculous thats not all i had a very uncomfortable experience and heres why i walked in and the front desk girl was really friendly she assigned me to a nail specialist right away they gave me the polish samples for my pedicure and the gel samples for my nails at once i had a hard time picking my gel color because there was so many options at last i finally picked a glittery color the nail specialist went on doing my nails and then min later all i see and hear is one of the nail specialist not mine basically talking down upon another employee i was not trying to eavesdrop i had no intention to im getting my nails done for god sake not looking for drama at a nail salon srsly but the nail specialist was so loud i literally heard every word she was saying and the worst part is she was talking about it to her clients did i walk into a nail salon or high school well its none of my business regardless but it was really unprofessional and unnecessary anyways so that occurred and i could already feel so much tension in the air awkward af after my girl was done doing my nails i walked up to the front to pay and she hands me my bill saying dollars uhhh what the heck most nails salons charge on gel mani unless you get acrylics or designs but i didnt have anything like that at all i kindly asked and the girl told me that its for the gel manicure and for the pedicure i asked why is it sixty and she said because of the brand no warning no sign nothing was said to me she was trying to make me feel better saying that this certain gel brand last longer i paid my plus tip and left a week later most of nails were lifting and chipping i refuse to go back never again beware this place will overcharge you without even warning or asking you so the first time i came to this salon i find it dusty dirty and messy but i liked how they did my nails so i was coming back over and over again until one day i came to done my pedi and gel mani and i knew how much it would cost me it was a regular pedi and a regular gel mani without any designs or somethings fancy when i go to the counter to pay my bill i was surprised about the price and i asked the details the girl at the counter told me something not logical it was extra for a regular pedi and extra for gel mani but the most unique part of it was extra for basically shaping and filing your nails i have a natural long square nails so i wanted to change it to a coffin shape nobody told me that they charging extra for this fancy procedure and i cant say that i got the perfect coffin shape it looks square still also i wasnt satisfied with my pedi my heels looked like nobody touch it i could do it so much better at home this salon only about the money nobody is taking a time on you at list if you guys overcharging people do the perfect and nice service and i was tipping good all the time i left the salon that day unhappy and definitely not coming back client shame on you diamond nails spa and salon i paid all together with tips ive been going here regularly for the past four months and my experience is really dependent on the nail technician i am paired with if it were not for christy winnie or nina id leave a two star review the receptionists leave a lot to be desired as well whether im calling in to place an appointment or walking in for my services the young ladies in the front almost always exhibit so much nonchalance and inattentive behavior toward everyone they must have it good at their jobs because id get fired from mine if i acted like a paying guest didnt matter to me during my last visit i ended up with someone other than the three aforementioned shining stars of diamond and she left a colorless gap on my big toe during a gel pedicure the time before that a male technician performed an acrylic gel fill that was uneven in length and a physically painful experience at one point he drew blood fro my cuticle with his gruff filing of my nails i can name as many disheartening and unsatisfactory experiences here as i can wonderful ones but ive learned my lesson about booking in advance theres a reason those three women are pretty much never available if you just walk in the care and consideration the exceptional customer service and detail they give to their clients keeps them coming back exclusively for them keep up the great work ladies and hopefully your colleagues will eventually follow suit as for the receptionists they all need to go love this salon highly recommended this place the service i received was awesome and i will never go anywhere but diamond its forever sam gives the best pedicures and best massage ask for him and you wont regret it i came here on a recommendation from another customer initially wanting a tribal nail design gel mani i was seen in about min and everyone was super friendly right off the bat the nail tech i had first told me she couldnt do a design in the time she had before her next appt so i got switched to nina who was great she also was not able to do the design i wanted but she told me what she could do which i really appreciated and gave me a great glitter fade gel mani she was awesome and told me who to go to next time for more elaborate nail art stars because i couldnt get exactly what i wanted but i know who to come to next time and nina was really great go see her i absolutely love christy shes always done a great job on every nail set that shes done me never had i had a nail lift or gel color chip i always walk out satisfied ive been going to her for over a year now and ill never leave sam is my foot angel he took my dry cracked athletic feet and gnarly toes and turned them into something respectable i will be proud to show off my sparkly toes in public now the ownermanager of diamond nails reached out to me after i had a terrible experience we spoke on the phone and he set me up with another appointment to fix my nails this time was amazing i was set up with another nail tech james and he was wonderful he knew exactly what i wanted and i was really really happy with the outcome of the nails thank you sam and james for everything see you soon i got a new naildo today by a true professional named james i read other yelp reviews about how talented he is and i decided to give it a go because of other reviews so thank you yelpers james listened to everything i wanted he was thorough and he took his time he cared that i got what i wanted i havent had a great nail artist in a very long time and i have to say that james tops her give him a shot you will not be disappointed the receptionist was also just a doll ive been going to diamond nails for about two years now their place is clean modern and the staff is so friendly and provides great service the prices are pretty reasonable and you can find their services and prices online as well i usually book my appointments through the phone but this time i booked it online since it was easy and convenient i usually request for my nail technician yuki since she does a great job and we get along i love coming here especially during the summers ill usually get a gel manicure and express pedicure dont get near to that place charge too much their job is not good at all i came to fill my nail and after i told the guy their times that i want pink and white fill he forget and start do my french with gel the base color wasnt what i wanted it was more like yellow so i said to him never mind and change the gel polish to blue after one day one nail cane off and the french polish that i did on my feet became yellow came back to fix it and they wanted to charge me for more when i told her that im not gonna pay on their mistake she started talking on me in front of me with her friend in other language so i wont understand bed experience and i feel bed that i pay for a fill and nail polish i started coming here because of the late hours but have felt attitude from the owners and some of the techs quite a few times but i brushed it off thinking i might be imagining it because in the couple months ive been coming here ive spent a lot of money but theyre definitely lacking on their customer service this is my breaking point and i will not come back yes the late hours are great but not worth being treated like crap and also just a word of advice if i get my nails done and break within a week which ive had nails for years and rarely have them break and if they do its because they werent done right you guys should repair my nails free of charge not charge me for each nail plus the late night fee when i got them done at night originally you guys lost a good customer i spend a lot of money im loyal and i tip well ive been going to diamond for a few months now ive known they are pricey but i always get solid colors so there was never any extra charges but the last time i went in i decided to get gel mani with french it was an extra for the french then i decided on two of my nails no french just a design i said idc what kind of design even if its just a few lines or something its fine its time to pay and i got charged an extra for the designs a finger i thought since i was already paying extra for the french but didnt get it on those fingers there wouldnt be an extra charge anyway i let it go paid and left my next visit i didnt want gel again i wanted to let me nails breathe so i just got a clean up mani and pedi well they charged me to take the gel off because i wasnt getting more gel finally on my last visit i asked for my normal gel mani pedi solid color my nail tech suggest i do the faded nail design i asked if she can do it on one nail to see if i like it and if not then she can just paint the whole nail she says no we cant do that just try it youll like it so i try it of course she failed to mention it would be an extra for the faded nail design if anything only half of the nail is being painted they should take off the price if thats how they wanna play all she did was dab her finger on the polish to give it the faded look anyway theres always an extra charge and youll never know about it until the end so be sure to ask if they charge before they do anything after today i will not be going back which sucks because i thought i found my nail shop forgot to mention they charged my yr old niece for a gel mani she barely has any nails how much polish could they have used on a yr old that they needed to charge again didnt warn us that its still same price for toddlers i love diamond nails every tech i have had here is amazing my nails always last longer than anywhere else i go their prices are great and they are open until pm which is so convenient for those who work a job was suggested by a co worker came in last minute they took me in and fixed up my nails perfectly also prices are reasonable thank you andrew go see him for your manicure best ive gotten in vegas out of the places ive been got a perfect line right up to my cuticle thanks andrew i have been going to diamond nails for about the past months love it they have recently started updating the salon with new furniture equipment which is making it look cleaner more professional which i like i go to ann as my nail artist she is fantastic every idea i present her with she does a superb job with my gel never peels always lasts atlas weeks prices are comparable to other salons kandy did a great job on my nails and her massages are on point hands and feet and plus shes a sweet heart cracking jokes i would love to have her again pedicure is okay i got the deluxe not really worth it to me for the ventilation here sucks the moment i stepped in here i feel my nostrils burn its close to my house so its convenient plus its open after pm but they charge you extra after again not worth it to me ugghh i swear my nostrils are burning here i was treated to a gel manicure and gel pedicure over a holiday weekend about weeks ago we had about a minute wait but it was well worth it i loved how my nails came out and will definitely be back here in the future lin is amazing i can finally say i found my nail lady so far i went to her twice and i alway leave feeling satisfied i had great expectations for this place but it turned out not to be so i arrived without an appointment and was told i could be seen right away this was great i told the receptionist that i wanted acrylics with regular polish and she said asked me to pick out my polish off the wall while she found my nail tech as i was looking at polishes on the wall my nail tech at least i thought it was her as she never introduced herself ran up from behind me and said are you sure you dont want gel i said no thank you as it was a upcharge from the already steep price of for an acrylic set i guess my no thank you wasnt firm enough as she continued to try and upsell me telling me it was only although getting annoyed i politely declined once i sat down my hands were pulled and tossed and turned in a very quick and aggressive manner it was unlike any manicure id had before i thought to myself well maybe shes having a bad day and shrugged it off she then asked me what length and shape i would like because apparently they have different prices for different shapes huh that was a first i told her what shape and length i wanted and she scoffed at me saying humpf that short ok then once again i shrugged it off and she continued to rough up my nails sans conversation the straw that broke the camels back was the finished product after sitting through the roughest manicure of my life i was finished went to the dryer dried my nails and left it looked good i thought until i got into the car and really looked at it the top was good but the bottom of my nails on one hand werent properly filed down and she had left polish on my fingers please see the photo who does that instead of leaving the nail salon renewed and refreshed i left upset just terrible the only plus was the very kind and courteous front desk woman she definitely deserves a raise this was the first time ever in my life that i felt uncomfortable in a nail salon and im so ya never again diamond nails i think ill take my business elsewhere for the most part all of the nail techs i used are good melissa and james by far have been the best my gel polish lasts over weeks i have been coming to diamond nails more than a few times now i normally have been seeing nina when i have time for myself i try to go to another nail salon well diamond nails is the only nail salon that opens till late pm and i normally get off work pm time most nail salons closes well i had my nails done at another nail salon previously and had done acrylic like i did with nina before hand well i was long overdue as i barely have the time to get my nails done due to constantly working i booked my appt with nina at pm she took me at pm because she had someone before me which was okay with me she started removing my acrylics with a fake nail then using nail clippers she poked me under my nail with one of the clippers painful as you can imagine but the pain doesnt end there as she was removing my middle finger on my left hand she ripped my nail half way even more painful she kept saying your nail so thin your nail so thin and making faces and noises of being grossed out by the bleeding nail that she made happen she kept a telling me my nail is so thin like its my fault like i know my nail is thin but never has this happened to me for having thin nails a nail tech should always examine a persons nails before working on them acrylics are to be soaked not brutally removed so with the bleeding nail she put a fake one over it originally i wanted clear gel but now i wish i got nothing done because you can clearly see the damage that has been done im not satisfied with my service and how she kept saying things in a different language and under her breath now im left with ugly nails and horrified to even go back there because im sure no one would examine anyones nails before working on them pictures labeled bleeding nail show what i came in with acrylics that were already breaking and ready to come off and also the horrifying nail that bleed and you can see how bad it was even the shape of the nail was uneven on how the gel was spread over it they also charge after pm what for the ownermanager should really think about that charge after pm if not then there should be an answer for every customer who comes in after that time they should also do a meeting on how to better their business services and professionalism put them through some basic classes too like acrylic removal how to work on thin nails etc im sorry but because of my bleeding nail im never coming back here again i been coming here for almost years i like the vibe and atmosphere in here and especially my nail tech who also became a friend christy is the best i highly recommend her to new clients and i also put all my gfs on her we all go to her she is on point with her nail game and can do anything you bring to her i like how she gets me in and out and is a perfectionist she is the best i absolutely love this place the times i go to another salon because its closer to what i am doing at the time i always regret it i never used to be picky as to who did my nails until i got christy she is the absolute best and my nails last forever whenever she does them and i am constantly entertained by her and her crazy antics her little sidekick an is also really good and is giving me an amazing pedicure at this very moment she has super strong fingers and gives a great massage i always recommend this place and have friends that live in summerlin that make the trip down here because theyre that good i had a family emergency and literally needed all hands on deck i damaged my nails cuticles badly they were cracking and bleeding consequently i came to nina and she fixed me up and made it so that that my natural nails can grow again and stop breaking thank you nina i love my nail}

{37062, Rufus DuMonde Pet Salon, 600 Williamson St Williamson - Marquette Madison WI 53703, in one word avoid petco could do a better job i took my dog here and they had her ready in one hour one hour that isnt enough time to wash her they do not hand trim there was no fresh smell on my dog like there should be for a few days after a complete grooming i am sure there are better groomers in madison i will find them we love this place i dont know what this other guy is talking about the crew at rufus are always bright and friendly and have a great rapport with our pooch we tried a few different groomers in madison but none could follow our instructions and couldnt figure out how to cut our jack russell mix correctly went to rufus and our little guy came back handsome as ever and fresh smelling too were customers for as long as we are in madison the only drawback is they are tough to get into appointments are usually booked a month out so call well in advance they do a great job on my poodle here very attentive thorough and skillful grooming nice low stress environment for my pup too the only place in town i will take my dogs i have a terrier mix and a giant schnauzer the terrier gets hand stripped by laura few groomers still hand strip the giant gets shaved since she is no longer in a stripped show coat the owner laura and her staff are friendly and the shop is nicely kept the dogs smell and look wonderful when they leave couldnt be happier we came here with our goldendoodle puppy with quite a few matted areas on his body we initially went to petsmart where they pretty much told us they were going to cut him from head to toe we were completely devastated because of our pups gorgeous fluffy coat after meeting with paula who gave excellent reassurance we ended up with a still fluffy as can be pup with his matted areas gone the pricing is quite reasonable because you definitely pay for what you get here paula did a wonderful job with our pup and we will never go anywhere else again great experience i dropped my girl off with paula and she phoned when she was nearly done two hours later i found my happy dog fresh and clean with trimmed nails and a summer haircut she even put two little bows in her hair which was a funny surprise it is two days later and she still smells great and is ready for summer heat when it gets here i had an awesome experience at rufus dumonde i took sully my two year old maine coon in for his first ever lion cut with paula she did an excellent job sully was done in about an hour his cut looked great his nails were trimmed and he didnt seem too stressed out by the experience sully purred the whole way home in his cat carrier i think he appreciated his new cut too paula definitely knows what shes doing when it comes to grooming cats were totally coming back paula did a great job simply trimming my kittys nail today i called and they said to come on over anytime my kitty is a handful and they were nice and patient great location and pricing we have border terriers that have been hand stripped twice at rufus dumonde they do an excellent job hand stripping their coats salsa and diva do not mind having their special time at this salon spa they come out smelling and looking pretty i highly recommend this salon especially for wire coated terriers the two groomers laura and katie are excellent they are very attentive to the dogs grooming needs as hand stripping is labor intensive i brought my papillon dog vivie here yesterday for her first grooming since adopting her the staff was helpful and knowledgeable in helping me decide what kind of cut options i had for her breed the groomer even gave me some pointers in brushing her as i am a new dog owner i really appreciated how much the groomer seemed to like dogs the cut took less than an hour and a half and my dog was happy when i arrived not scared and confused like sometimes dogs can get when you leave them in new places id definitely recommend the staff is friendly knowledgeable and best of all will really like and take great care of your pup today was my first time having our portuguese water dogs groomed at rufus dumonde pet salon and i cant help but to keep smiling at the work that was done the work our pwds needed seemed extensive especially since one is a month old puppy its tough to find a place that will cut our dogs the way we like and this was perfect the consult before the grooming was great and im just thrilled i will no longer be searching for a place to get our dogs groomed because i have officially found it thank you so much great place only place that takes the dog and does the dog right then no waiting all day and the dog sitting in a kennel if i could give stars i would almost perfect we sent our corgi fluff there for grooming they did a great job trimming him and his coat was so wonderfully soft again after his bath he even smelled great they missed one or two mats thats why i say almost perfect but he was happy and relaxed when we picked him up i would definitely recommend rufus dumonde without hesitation to anyone who asks took my wiggly labrador for a nail trim first time at rufus dumonde i love the fact that i didnt need an appointment and didnt need to leave my dog and come back great service and very friendly staff given the service price and convenience i will be back thank you im so happy i looked into rufus du monde for cat grooming their name coupled with their willy street location led me to assume their pricing would be expensive however they are the cheapest cat groomer ive yet to find in madison for a lion cut including a bath and blow dry what a treat the whole event took less than two hours do plan ahead though they run by appointment only and were booked out three to four weeks when i scheduled overall}

{11405, Mandarin Gourmet, 305 Wood St Downtown Pittsburgh PA 15222, i think gourmet may be stretching it a bit but mandarin gourmet does manage to rise above the mediocre haze of fast food chinese places in the downtown area if i could id probably give it stars with large lunch specials and an inviting space for patrons who prefer to stay and eat the mg balances their somewhat greasy and oversauced standard chicken pork and beef dishes with hospitality fast service and never providing a truly bad meal as a regular who eats there once a week or so the management and staff recognize me such personal attention at a downtown restaurant whats more if you tire of their run of the mill general tsos or sesame chicken try their soup noodle dishes for a refreshing change lunch specials come with soup or an egg roll and your choice of rice i always get steamed rice simply because the amount of sauce included with the dish will usually permeate the rice anyway if you eat there the rice will come in a separate bowl as opposed to the one piece tupperware you receive if you choose to grab take out instead their portions as i mentioned are large the mg is one place that wont leave you wondering how soon youll get to eat dinner i absolutely love mandarin gourmet for lunch or dinner to me it is second only to chinatown inn as the best chinese food in downtown pittsburgh as scott d says they have a great lunch special menu for you get your choice of chow mein chicken or pork moo goo gai pan hunan chicken szechuan chicken cashew chicken chicken garlic sauce curry chicken as you can see i love chicken or assorted beef or pork dishes with your choice of egg roll or soup i recommend the hot sour soup rice tea and fortune cookies their dinners are very reasonable most are in the to range my favorite is seafood delight which is shrimp scallops lobster tail and assorted seafood sauteed with vegetable in white sauce when i want to splurge i get the lobster dishes for the egg rolls here are fresh and they melt in your mouth i also like for an appetizer the pork dumplings either fried or steamed mmmmm i think ill tell my husband that the fridge broke and we need to go out for dinner tonight i do not understand how this place stays in business my comment has nothing to do with the location and everything to do with the food and the service i like to think that i am fairly open about assessing a new place but the is not a chinese restaurant the best thing that i can say about the entire experience is that it didnt taste bad there was no flavor in anything wow really i can only think of the allegory of the cave when reading previous reviews and then to feel sorry if this is one of the best chinese restaurants in pittsburgh really as i was walking here i saw that their specialty was sichuanszechuan and hunan styles of cooking i thought that was awesome since i prefer szechuan style cooking dont believe what you read though the best approximation of the the taste and texture of this food is the cheap cantonese dishes that i ordered in hong kong the difference is that i only paid cents for three times as much food the food we ordered pan fried pork dumplings wonton egg drop combo fried rice yeung chow kung pao chicken unsweet tea coke the service was horrible the server only had three tables and she was running around like foghorn leghorn after colonel sanders chopped off his head in family guy what made it worse is that the ownermanager was watching the entire time and not interceding to try and make the experience better for your benefit i will list the order of how my order arrived fried rice entree after minutes of waiting egg drop soup and wonton soup appetizer minutes after the fried rice coke and iced tea drinks minutes after the soup kung pao chicken entree minutes after our drinks arrived dumplings appetizer a good minutes after the kung pao chicken i am not going to bore you with the poor excuses uttered by the waitress at least she appeared to be trying in the best way she could the fact that the managerowner was just watching the entire situation just pissed me off i didnt finish eating anything if you enjoy eating coagulated goop in differing levels of solidity then this is the place for you if you dont like chinese food because it tastes like the food at this place please try again in a different place this is not good chinese food the most amazing part was the table of chinese men that were sitting at the table next to me they were continually asking for items that they were not recieving two of the gentlemen actually went to speak to the manager in chinese and the manager still did nothing horrendous at per person this is quite overpriced i shall never return as a devoted fan of this restaurant i was very surprised to see it get some low marks i cant speak to the authenticity of the food here since i have never been to china but i can say that this is by far my favorite chinese restaurant in pittsburgh thats compared to tong garden in brookline ka mei in squirrel hill tasty in shadyside yens in east liberty sichuan house in scott twp and east wind in green tree to name a few and i definitely prefer mandarin gourmet over pf changs granted i have never tried a meat dish here i always get the tofu because it is exquisite crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside it is very substantial and a welcome treat to vegetarians and omnivores alike the staff is very personable as well i called on a sunday when they were closed for a private party and the manager took my order anyway at lunch the place is always hoppin it is tuesday at noon right now and the place is packed lots of white collars and ties but i often see students too maybe its just personal preference but i cant get enough of this place ive eaten here a couple times and cant say that im impressed much its standard american chinese fare pretty heavily over sauced and not particularly unique in its flavors i was pleasantly surprised when i went there for lunch today and the service was very fast despite the large lunch crowd perhaps thats because i ordered the ol standby general tsos chicken which they probably have pre prepared in large quantities still ive had better chinese in pittsburgh so i cant give this place high marks i like the lunch specials here especially the soup you can choose between several noodles and choice of protein and its a decent filling quick lunch if you want real chinese food then you probably should go to china ive eaten what we americans consider to be chinese food all across the country and it all pretty much has the same general flare to it its usually fried comes with a side of duck sauce and gives you a stomach ache afterwords mandarin gourmet technically is no different then any other americanized version of chinese food however the service really sets it apart i have been going here since college and never had bad service or bad food the staff always is very friendly and sadly they recognize me when i come in the prices are comparable to any other sit down chinese establishment the best time to go is lunch no matter how full the building is you will be out in minutes and thats if you take your time no matter what ive ordered i get my meal in minutes its kind of unbelievable all things considered i have no reason eat chinese anywhere else downtown while most chinese food is pretty much the same this place really stands out i would really give it stars if i could but i grade on a curve this place is fine it is basic american chinese food it is better than buffet places but like other reviewers have said there is better chinese food available in pittsburgh ie china palace in shadyside they have a good lunch special and the service is pretty fast for a large dining room the location is great it is a good lunch spot downtown to sit have lunch and be on the go within an hour you will not impress a date or client with this place you or they could do better but for a get out of the office for an hour lunch with friends this will do just fine the restrooms are weirdly outside the restaurant in the lobby of the ymca which is fine just weird this place brings me back to my college days at point park where the cafeteria food sucked and this was a welcome haven from that almost gourmet shall we say compared to the slop served up at ppu i feel like people can legitmately say theres a difference between tex mex and authentic mexican is there really an authentic chinese food is general tso a real person all these questions irregardless i love this place i think the shrimp rolls deserve the highest rating with a nice crispy outside and crispy cabbage inside my go to meal choice of sweet n sour chicken is always fab i love that they put enough sauce on which is a lot so beware if you dont like a lot that i can mix it up in my oh so healthy white rice cough cough and i love that they give you free tea and its good i never use sweetener its some sort of jasmine blend and i always enjoy going with people that dont drink a lot because i usually drink it all and for realz how do you beat the lunch special a choice of egg roll or soup fried rice steamed rice or brown rice and tea for bam full until hours later but thats the joy of chinese and boy did it taste good going down best fortune i ever received was also from here life is better with a cat meow havent eaten here in a few years and my review needed a little updating okay thats not why i ate here again recently i came here with my fellow supervisors because we wanted to have a little luncheon and we were all in the mood for chinese its still a great deal for lunch even though the prices have gone up a little since my last review most lunches are in the range and include choice of egg roll or soup plus your choice of rice and hot tea and fortune cookies great deal but cant i have both soup and egg roll with my lunch especially since i like both hot n sour and egg drop soups lunch here is your typical somewhat americanized chinese fare including sweet n sour pork cashew chicken chow mein etc for those of you wanting spicier fare theyve got your usual hunan beef general tsos chicken and shrimp szechuan style me i prefer milder more basic chow i went for the shrimp with broccoli so as far as the lunch menu is concerned theres nothing here thatll set the world on fire but mandarin gourmet is good for a basic lunch while walking down wood street last week i almost came to a screeching halt the sign in the window of mandarin gourmet almost flashed gluten free gluten free gluten free at me like some sort of wanton wonton asian temptress gluten free chinese outside of my regular relationship with pf be still my heart when i got back to the office i immediately corralled a couple of coworkers to get real chinese with me the next day oh boy it wouldnt be the americanized version old pf dishes up it would be authentic i could hardly wait the anticipation killed me oh pf youd never know and i sure wouldnt tell you i was thinking of straying from our steady relationship for another gf chinese meal so the next day we giddily okay full disclosure i was the only giddy one headed into the somewhat dingy and dated space i wasnt there for stylish decor i could get that at pfs besides it added to the excitement of living on the edge bring on the new stuff for starters of the typical soups hot and sour wonton and egg drop only the egg drop was gf one taste and i i was beginning to regret my errant ways the soup was eerily bright yellow tasted like dishwater and had an grease slick on top that rivaled the gulf oil spill no chicken on earth has ever been a color that could have produced such a hue shiverrrrrrr did i make a mistake in straying should i have remained faithful to my trusted pf still the kung pao chicken tickled my fancy of forbidden delights i looked forward to those familiar hot spicy flavors from someone new and different soon there it was right in front of me a huge pile of rice creating a wall to corral a flood of crunchy peanut topped veggies and chicken id ordered it spicy please envisioning hot and steamy fun to come nope hot it wasnt i had to ask for something to kick up the heat there was a fair amount of chicken amidst mostly celery and a few pieces of carrot maybe some onion but it wasnt really distinguishable although one giant bottom of a green pepper was hidden at the bottom of the plate the best part of lunch was the crunchy peanuts perched atop the dish needless to say i was disappointed i know i have only myself to blame in my excitement i forgot how hard it is to find really good chinese food how before the gf issue the only places i really liked were the great wall in ross and sesame inn lesson learned any gf chinese food is not the same as good and reliable gf chinese food hey pf i didnt really cheat on you it wasnt the real thing it was just a silly momentary fling will you take me back you know i cant live without you or your lovely lettuce wraps i will be kind and give them four stars good chinese and very busy at lunch good place for chinese in downtown pgh chinese food really youve turned your back on me this restaurant is really nothing special nothing to walk all the way down wood street from grant street for really hardly any care goes into the preparation of their dishes this is how im feeling towards a lot of chinese food establishments anymore its greasy soggy limp veggies served on rock hard dried out rice the mandarin gourmet wow what a laugh not worth my time energy or money hell i dont even have a better place i could suggest you go to downtown for chinese what a shame there is nothing mandarin or gourmet about this restaurant the name is a total farce stopped in and grabbed takeout for lunch was a bit concerned when i read yelp reviews after i had placed my order however for takeout it wasnt bad the egg roll was a little bland on flavor but the sesame sauce was not too sweet which most places waaaay over do and i ordered my chicken as all white meat nice they give you the option portion for lunch was larger than necessary but i would say the price is in line for the quantity an quality of food you can always count on this place for a good lunch nothing too crazy just your regular americanized chinese food its a much better option than the ppg food court chinese food which is known to make people sick eek great lunch prices gets a little busy so id suggest making your way over before noon i had food from here delivered to my office last week and i thought it was very good food that came fast i had the bento box with excellent shrimp teriyaki white rice miso shumai dumplings and a california roll it was a cute little japanese lunch from a chinese place anyway i recommend well the sushi is great i get sushi from mandarin about times a week it is by far the best sushi in the city as for the food yeah there are better places in china i can only imagine what these people say about typical chinese places because this is great compared to other chinese restaurants road trip dinner pittsburgh pa after a day spent going to and visiting fallingwater my parents and i decided to stop in pittsburgh for dinner they wanted chinese and since we were parked nearby we pretty much stumbled onto this restaurant by default the restaurant doesnt look too promising at the start its a big restaurant by american chinese food standards and most of it was sitting empty a look through the menu wasnt too promising either it revealed a restaurant trying to attract a broad customer base by including many different cuisines the skeptic in me believes that any restaurant that tries to branch into different cuisines is usually not good at any of them on the other hand american chinese isnt a great cuisine to begin with so if the fujianese owner spoke some halting mandarin so we couldnt communicate as much as wed like to luckily the waitress did speak good enough mandarin so we were able to tell her what we wanted first off cooked vegetables for my mother of course the restaurant had a pleasant treat for us yu choy or choy sum a cantonese vegetable thats rarely encountered in any american chinese restaurant we got a big plate of the yu choy that was cooked not too greasily and flavored nicely and subtly we also started our meal off with three bowls of hot and sour soup my mother remarked that the tofu in the soup was very fresh which was good news for our next dish the mapo tofu was fresh spicy and very well cooked we also ordered the pepper steak and it was not bad the beef was fresh and cooked well but the dish wasnt very remarkable otherwise overall the restaurant offered a nice surprise to a few weary travelers looking for some decent chinese food advice when eating at all american chinese restaurants ask the restaurant to cook your food in less oilsalt the restaurant also offers japanese cuisine definitely and thai cuisine maybe i dont remember on their menu i didnt try either of them so i cant comment overall my favorite part of the restaurant was probably the decor i liked the high ceilings muted aquamarine color scheme and the tall windows overlooking the city streets when i think of a restaurant located around the downtown office buildings of a mid sized american city somehow this restaurants setting is exactly what i think of get yourself a booth next to the windows and relax in the urban setting around you completely average food prices and atmosphere they are fast for a sit down restaurant which is nice if youre in a hurry very standard nothing particularly bad or good the chinese food equivalent of beige best chinese food down town i am only giving this place stars for consistency with my ratings in other towns if you are in downtown pittsburgh this is your spot i like this place better than chinatown inn or whatever the other one is called go here when looking for a decent chinese food spot not the best in the country but a solid choice this afternoon i had a chance to catch a meal at an old regular lunch spot my fortune today balance life with a little sweet sour a very fitting fortune and advice i am taking in writing this review the sour i have all but given up on asian cuisine in pittsburgh compared to other major cities throughout the us we pittsburgh are strongly lacking that said this is one of the better options for chinesemandarin food in the area my rating of stars is based on the fact there are no really great options available in any other major city this place is a star restaurant at best the sweet while i have had other menu items today i opted for the general tsos white meat with brown rice and a shrimp egg roll first off i like that they have the option to go with white meat for the dish the sauce is just a tad too sweet for me but i think it will be suited for others who do not care for spicy heat i like the option to get brown rice but i recall it was free before and now there is an up charge i still say go for the brown rice as the mandarin inn is tops in getting the consistency right there are multiple options for an egg roll or spring roll with chicken or shrimp in the egg roll options the best part of the meal and what keeps me coming back is the spicy mustard this stuff will bring tears to your eyes in large amounts and will also really clear the sinuses if needed i recommend this for anyone not fearing some strong horseradish flavor all in all i had a good meal and will continue to return to this establishment when i am downtown and my craving for some asian cuisine starts to peak again they wouldnt deliver to me bc i ordered only one item she said i no drive to you for dollars i said please ill tip she said ill be there in minutes i havent got my food yet bc i just got off the phone hopefully they dont read this before i get it i ordered the genreral tso chicken but said easy on the sauce ill let yall know how it is on another post if i dont get into a food coma every now and then i get a hankering for chinese food for lunch and order takeout from here i used to have to call but now you can order and pay through their website however after having order via the website today with pick up time selected as asap i will call in the future i ordered pork with garlic sauce white rice and egg drop soup normally when i order takeout via telephone it is ready by the time i get there to pick it up just a few minute walk from my office today however i arrived to pick it up and waited after the cashier asked my nameorder i saw him furiously scribble something down on an order pad then walk back to check on my order i dont think they checked their web order and my order had been sitting there without going back to the kitchen minutes after the timestamp on my order confirmation email the food was ready thats an enternity for chinese take out the food is good fresh and a nice portion size but i ordered take out because i didnt want to wait and sit down somewhere dont get me wrong the food here is fantastic and if you eat in or pick up you cannot go wrong the delivery is usually decent but if there is an issue with your card you have to wait longer than they promise to get your food they dont process cards online so they have to do it in the restaurant its a little frustrating esepcially when they promise a specific time great for a quick lunch downtown service used to be slow but as of late service has been extremely fast we were seated ordered our food and served in less than minutes the quality is good for the price certainly not cheap but not pricey either i think it was about for wonton soup and general tsos chicken food was hot fast and portions were large not a place to treat a client but a great coworker lunch spot every time i visit the service is fast and efficient and the food is absolutely delicious the portion sizes are huge and i always have enough to take home for an extra meal i get the same thing every time i am at any chinese restaurant chicken broccoli with steamed rice white sauce and i must say that their white sauce is one of the most flavorful that i have had in the pittsburgh area great lunch spot well this review is more about the cleanliness than the food dont get me wrong the food isnt that good either but when youre in a pinch and want some greasy chinese food this place will do the place is old i get it but when you walk in you can tell the place is hasnt been maintained in a while they are way understaffed they have waitresses for the entire lunch rush which doesnt make sense the waitress i had seemed super stressed out we had to wait to get seated the poor old white lady forgot to take our order then forgot to get our food when we went to leave there was no one to ring us out when they bring you hot tea they just took it from the table before you that left the water sits in prefilled glasses on a cart in the corner of the restaurant they wiped down a dirty table with a gross and used rag im assuming the general tsos sits in a bin im the kitchen thats why it always comes out first i got the pork lol mein it was pretty tasty this aint no sesame inn not even the same caliber as chinatown in at least its a little better than that fu lai place im not trying to be harsh hell im proud to admit to be a chinese american but if anyone from the restaurant is reading this clean your air vents i looked in when sitting next to the window and could see the years of garbage piled up people stuffed down there years ago if they stopped being cheap and hired more help im sure i wouldve rated this place a lot higher you can tell the owner cuts corners everywhere mandarin gourmet is my favorite chinese restaurant in all of pittsburgh rivaled only by nakama while you may wait a few moments to get a booth if you like sushi it is worth the wait and is the freshest i have ever had prices are a little high but i think the sushi is worth it honestly i have not tried much else on the menu as i come to this place for one purpose sushi i also love that they serve hot tea with your meal for free such a lovely touch food is decent always get the szechuan string beans and they are always good delivery service however is beyond terrible we ordered over an hour and a half ago today and still dont have our food this is not the first time we have been burned by them we probably should have learned from the last time if you are going to offer delivery you need to be able to actually deliver in a timely manner i thought that their online ordering feature would make this whole issue easier ha what a joke yes your ordering is easier but if they dont check their online orders then they cant actually fill or deliver them their customer service also leaves something to be desired when you call to complain all you get from them is oh on its way or delivery guy left no customer service no regard for customer orders just terrible honestly we probably wont ever order from them again which is a shame because they really are the only decent chinese restaurant in town with today being national chopstick day i braved the frigid degree february cold for a chinese lunch at the mandarin gourmet this spacious restaurant was already getting a respectable crowd when i walked in around noon time i was quickly seated at a booth and given a menu to look over the lunch specials seemed very reasonably priced and i looked over my choices hoping to see chicken or beef lo mien discovering that that wasnt an option i decided on the sweat n sour shrimp with a bowl of hot n sour soup a tin pot of hot tea was placed at my table and i thought what a nice touch my hot and sour soup followed shortly behind the soup was thick with tofu and the broth of the soup had almost a syrupy consistency in a good way i was beginning to like this place it didnt take very long for the main dish to arrive and it came beautifully presented i was really believing that this place was a new gem that i discovered then i took a bite into one of the sweet n sour shrimp rings and was oh so totally disappointed remember that old commercial wheres the beef well thats almost what went through my mind wheres the shrimp all you could taste and all you could see was this doughy coating i decided to dissect one of the rings and i was able to locate the tiniest shrimpiest of shrimp dont believe me take a look at the pic i took of it its that mess on the napkin the shrimp is on top and the dough is on the bottom i looked over at another table and there was a gentleman who got a broccoli and shrimp dish and his shrimp were big and plump and healthy looking compared what i got i guess since his shrimp wasnt wearing a doughy disguise and were in plain view the proprietors of the mandarin gourmet felt that they couldnt get away with serving the sickliest of shrimp to him judging by what i saw on the plates of other patrons and from the crowd that they get im thinking that i just choose the wrong dish today im planning on coming back sometime soon and trying a menu item that doesnt have the opportunity to camouflage itself and perhaps boost my rating of this place but as for now its a definite two star as far as im concerned so the food is pretty good good enough that ive dealt with their b s about making me wait for minutes every time i make an online order for takeout their system asks for a pickup time and i usually come minutes after that pickup time then i still am forced to wait another minutes for them to get the order out i ordered soup quite possibly the easiest thing for you to get out the door and you still cant manage to get it together what if i had ordered some super complicated like a stirfry would i have had to wait three hours for that today was the last straw i made the order minutes ahead of time came to pick it up a little bit after the time stated and still sat there for minutes i only have a minute lunch it takes a few minutes to walk to the restaurant and a few back so their continued just a few more minutes meant that i was looking at coming back to the office without even two minutes to eat my lunch so i just left i am done with this place be honest that you cannot get orders out on time all i ordered was soup something you have already made also there was only one table in the restaurant with customers just one top you cannot tell me that you were slammed or had other issues now i find myself at work without lunch and no time to get any food until about pm when i can leave and go home next time i want take out ill go someplace with a bit of respect for their customers ive ordered the hot and sour soup or times and it was cold each time the lunch specials are cheaper but after ordering them times with co workers you realize that its really heavy and not so great quality my office orders lunch from this restaurant fairly frequently and not once has our food been delivered without a problem we have had sweet and sour chicken delivered with no sweet and sour sauce entire meals forgotten the wrong sides etc also their chow mein is not chow mein at all if you are going to have something on your menu that isnt actually what the dish is traditionally then i suggest putting a description of the item on your menu i expected a good meal of chow mein and ended up with a goopy bowl of mush with not a noodle in sight my office may continue to order from this restaurant but i am finally fed up it is lousy service for mediocre food i stopped in with a friend who came downtown specifically to have lunch we decided on mandarin gourmet and were seated immediately a young gentleman came to our table with placemats water and tea but no tea cups the tea cups were eventually placed in front of us and he asked if we were ready to order i ordered the sesame chicken with white meat and my friend ordered the general tsos chicken also with white meat both were lunch specials and were served with an egg roll the egg roll came out warm but not hot like it was sitting under a heat lamp i tried to lift the lid on the sauce at the table but it was stuck to the jar i wondered when it was last cleaned we skipped the sauce and ate plain egg rolls that werent great but they werent awful either our meals came piping hot i ate two pieces of chicken and then the third piece that i put in my mouth was chewy i spit it out in my napkin and realized that it was all fat or skin i took another bite and the chicken tasted old reheated or something it just didnt taste right i decided to work on the rice and wait for a server one came by and dropped the check off so quickly that i didnt have a chance to say anything i thought surely someone would notice a full plate and at the very least offer a box minutes went by and my friend was finished so we decided to leave i told the cashier of my experience and she argued with me that the chicken is fresh i said that may be the case but it tasted awful she said she would be right back she came back minutes later and with a line of people waited to be seated she offered us off of the check i said i ate pieces of chicken an egg roll and some rice that is hardly i was finally so frustrated that i paid and did not leave a tip i rarely do that but i felt that the service failed miserably needless to say we will not be back i have lunch here occasionally over the last year the food quality and service has diminished it was usually an ok place understaffed for a busy lunch you will see wait staff running last week chicken served freezer burned tried again this week and the sauce had that distinct burned taste to it i ate it but it prompted me to leave the review i think there are three chinese restaurants downtown and for having tried two of them this one is my favorite sadly downtown just isnt the place for good chinese food mandarin gourmet is a good place to go if youve really got a hankering for chinese food for lunch otherwise there are so many other better places to go the lunch specials are decently priced and portioned but the taste and quality are just okay however if you order take out for dinner it seems like they step up the quality just a notch the dishes seem a lot fresher when you order dinner take out perhaps the lunch rush has them cranking out orders too fast or its a different cook a tip go somewhere else in the suburbs if you want tasty chinese food i am recently back in my hometown from my adoptive home of the s f bay area and i wanted a little taste of that mandarin gourmet proved not only to fit the bill but to be beautiful and less expensive than what i had gotten used to on the west coast while also at least as delicious if not more so its hard to make such a fine distinction for certain after such good food and sake great food very friendly staffs food is traditional chinese food and fit to all people the restaurant is very clean after a recommendation from a colleague i decided to give this place a try i am not big on chinese food i order the same thing shrimp and broccoli in garlic sauce this place has the best shrimp and broccoli so far the shrimp are a nice size the broccoli is fresh and the garlic sauce is the best ive tasted to date i havent dined in at this establishment but it is always packed around lunch time and service seems to be pretty fast the only con was the wait time for my meal but i will attribute that to busy lunch hour other than that this place has a good shrimp and broccoli dish i cant attest to anything else on their menu}
{58865, Bikram Yoga Chandler, 1900 W Germann Rd Ste 3 Chandler AZ 85286, i have been a yogini for nine years participating in all yoga disciplines however my favorite by far is bikram yoga want to get in shape become more flexible feel stronger rid yourself of toxins and improve the look of your skin then bikram yoga is for you this is the yoga to practice if you suffer from any ailments are on prescription medication or have chronic pain this yoga cures it all bikram yoga chandler has a great vibe and is clean sanitary and inviting the owners are so nice the teachers are terrific and the location is awesome so happy they opened a studio close to my house this studio is beautiful and the staffinstructors are really friendly i recommend arriving at least minutes before a session time in order to get a good spot in the room as it fills up fast love my hot yoga i bought a class day expiration groupon so i could finally give bikram a chance i am an avid yoga enthusiast astanga yingyang flow etc but i only decided to pursue the sweat box that is bikram when i got a leg injury that prevented me from doing basically any other cardio if you are new or unknown to the bikram world let me just give you a tiny idea its extremely standardized poses done twice each in the exact same order every single time done in a room with approx f humidity and where the instructor does not perform the poses with you but instead talks you through the motions and postures for the entire mins you will sweat ache and if you dont eat enough risk passing out getting tunnel vision faint oh and then there is the mat hierarchy since the class isnt taught by demonstration the rows of mats get separated by most experienced front row and nbs back row so that the front rowers can show everyone else how its done i say f to this hierarchy as soon as i learned the poses i went to the front i dont need to get there mins before class start so i can get shoved to the back by someone who has done yoga for years and still cant lock her knee i encourage you to do whatever feels right and tell whoever sends you back to go jump of a bridge so if bikram is so damn standard how do you set aside a good experiencestudio from a bad one simple the teacher the environment the staff and most importantly the hygiene and smells remember you are in a sweat box with people and not all of them sweat like roses and lemons when working out my first time at byc i was struck but the nasty smell of sweat when i entered the locker rooms freaking disgusting luckily i never smelled that shit every again which is why i kept returning trust me i could not have finished my groupon if i had to smell the scent of a decaying corpse every time i went to put on my sports bra the teachers like any other studio range from amazing to crappy my favorite teacher is alison she is in amazing shape she is kind but she doesnt pick favorites she doesnt yell into the microphone throughout her class and she is great at correcting you doing demos and ensuring you are getting the full benefit of the pose she notices her returning students and points out when they are getting better which is just the positive reinforcement you need when you are trying to get into a new yoga field and then theres the not so great teachers one of them who shall not be named was overweight in her late s yelled into the microphone wore a tiny weenie itsy bitty floral bikini and let alll her jiggly parts hang out like poorly wrapped tamale she would come over to you during savasana and put her feet on top of yours she wouldnt even ask she would just do it as she is doing that her sweat is falling on you oh dear god i thought if she comes near me im going to puke i put my feet up in the air so she couldnt step on me and pass to the next person i dont ever want to have class with a lady like her again yeeeeh so why the stars because after doing bikram at other studios i have come to compare and appreciate my experience at byc most of the teachers really are fantastic the yoga rooms rarely smell sweaty which is a big deterrent from those non bikram doers btw the admin staff at the front desk are a joy to be around the classes arent too full and the people are very friendly and courteous to each other their bathrooms are not crammed their waiting area is nicely decorated and you get a great community feel that is not easily found elsewhere maybe its time for people to stop comparing themselves and bond over the fact that they are all struggling through the sweat induced pain of holding their leg in the air for seconds right right namaste i started bikram yoga months ago now after purchasing a groupon and i am hooked i was definitely nervous going the first time knowing it was going to be an hour and a half workout in a hot box but the instructors are wonderful and have a lot of dialog with you about what feelings and sensations to expect and really reinforce doing only what you can do even if that means sitting out a few postures absolutely will be a part if my life from here on out i have thyroid cancer and feel stronger and healthier than i have in a really long time and am so thankful for the peace that gives me i feel less dependent on the doctor to tell me how i am doing really pushing myself in this class helps give me confidence in knowing i am just fine i am so thankful for this practice thank you byc and your wonderful staff the instructors are friendly although this is my first time every trying bikram yoga its a different experience the instructors do not show you the poses but help you while you are going through the poses the studio is clean i am brand new to yoga and was nervous about my first class so i called ahead to gather some information so i would be prepared i spoke with heidi who was wonderful told me exactly what i needed to know and put me at ease she was also the instructor of my class and did a fabulous job instructing and ensuring we were connecting with the overall experience i will definitely return bikrim is the best yoga i have really seen a huge difference going to bikram yoga my body is being transformed seeing results going roughly times a week for weeks i starting going here because their was a groupon and i wanted to try something different and loved the options of class times i was very out of shape i have been given many alternatives to the advanced poses since i am unable to do them without these alternatives i would not have been able to practice and see progress i was concerned about the religious aspect of yoga but have been uncomfortable only twice with the new management taking over i hope to keep the late classes pm the teaching of alternatives encouragement and safe non religious aspects i would love to keep coming and making this my long term yoga home i recently signed up for bycs days for it was amazing the studio is very clean and organized with very accommodating restrooms that included showers stocked with shampoo conditioner body wash hair dryers deodorant etc you name it they got it the instructors are all friendly and helpful by far my favorite is emily she is sweet and encouraging she pushes you with positive reenforcement and a smiling happy face instead of barking orders like some instructors tend to do and she is always willing to give extra instruction after class my only complaints would be that the schedule is very thin and they use carpet in the classroom with only an average of classes a day none of which are in the midday it can be tricky making it in with my schedule as for the carpeting it really is my biggest turn off id much rather hard surface floors that can be mopped after ever class in bikram yoga classes everyone sweats i dont relish in the thought of any part of my body even my feet touching someone elses puddle of sweat or smelling a mildew smell when lying in face down savasana carpet just doesnt seem as sanitary as it could be overall i enjoyed my experience at byc and i will most likely be back for practice in the future hi everyone not closed under new ownership management it is now bikram yoga ocotillo grand opening may schedule is set hot room is ready go to yogaocotillo com everyone is welcome if you had purchased yoga packages with the previous management bring in your receipt it will be honored try going back you deserve it}
{50318, Independence Gym, 2980 N Hayden Rd Scottsdale AZ 85251, i just started working out at independence gym because they offered my boyfriend a great deal if two of us signed up this gym is a no frills workout space that is designed exactly for that working out people who come to this gym come to work out not to show off their new matching sports bra pants set or to pick up a date for friday night that fact alone i love it the trainers at this gym are actually good trainers they have educations experience that are actually legitimate unlike some of the other gyms i have been to everyone is friendly helpful plenty of cardio machines lots of free weights love all the machines you could want this is a great gym all around keep it up independence dont change a thing tried out this gym on a free week pass they have great equipment practically everything you need in there i also never had to wait to use anything but also i was there at in the morning so i cant attest to the busier times the staff seemed friendly they never asked to punch our card or check the date to see if we were over our visits the monthly rates seem competative too my negatives and the reason i didnt join was that the place was a little dark with the lighting for me i know it sounds like a weird reason but at in the morning i need something to help wake me up i didnt care for their aerobics room the locker room albeit clean was a little small and felt cramped with only a few other women in there i also was a little sketchy about the sales pitch as they offered the best deal if you paid for a year up front but i know that there have been a few gyms come through this location and i was concerned about the staying power of this one more power to em though if they make it this is a great gym if your serious about fitness or competitive bodybuilding figure fitness or bikini great atmosphere for getting a great workout has some of the best personal trainers in the valley this is my new gym for as long as i plan to live in arizona after my la fitness fiasco i decided that a local gym was more up my alley i wanted something small less crowded not douchy and locally owned i turned to yelp and found independence gym not gonna lie i saw some of my yelp friends check in here so i thought maybe they are on to something its not far from my house and a couple doors away from planned parenthood whatever that means anyway i came in and this was the gym of my dreams it was prime time just after work hours enough of a crowd that it wasnt empty but it wasnt overcrowded an amazing selection of cardio equipment stair climbers treadmills ellipticals bikes etc the free weights are perfect everything was racked both the employees and members were racking their own weights the dumbbells are not clearly marked so you may have to do light math in your head thank god im indian and smart there are tons of benches here when i worked out at la fitness there were benches total so people would use the benches at the seated row machine to do various exercises it was annoying there are nearly a dozen here there is even a lunge station complete with hardwood floor and free bar locker rooms were perfect and clean now the disclaimer if you are looking for a pussy gym this isnt the place dont expect flat screen tvs although there are enough tvs here wifi etc this is a place to get your swoll on this is not a country club no steam rooms saunas pools hot tubs basketball courts this is a gym not a resort you come here to work out not relax and live like a lord dont come here looking to socialize its not lifetime la fitness or hour this place is legit also it turns out to be cheaper than la fitness no contract and no pressure to sign up for personal training at la fit they would say free personal training session and then hammer you with a sales pitch for training none of that here my only gripe but they claim it will be remedied no spin classes they say the classes will be added by the end of the year not a big deal because i can go to spin elsewhere for the time being this is just a gym where you can work out friendly people locally owned and if you want a real trainer not some idiot who passed an online test you can hire one here i was tired of the environment at la fitness so i decided to give a smaller gym a try after one week i joined and completely canceled my la membership independence is never overly packed and you hardly ever have to wait to use any of the weights or machines the equipment is a little older but still effective i do miss the sauna and basketball court but all in all its a small price to pay for a lower monthly premium non scottsdale environment there is a good selection of classes offered the staff is always highly visible but never pressures you to buy any personal training sessions the locker rooms and bathrooms are always clean and there is plenty of locker space to store your stuff there is a small store nothing like the juice bar at la that sells protein bars energy drinks water protein drinks etc they even give a small discount when paying with cash all in all highly recommended update to five stars its with much sadness that i cancel my membership because i am moving out of state but i update my review to five stars because of some improvements the club has made since my joining drinking fountains now dispense ice cold water if for some reason they dont they have a fridge full of cold bottled water for you the ac blows cold air awesome sauce the hours are now during the week very convenient cancelling my membership was not a massive ordeal i came in met with jay and told him what was up no guilt trip no upsell no douchy sales pitch like the one people get at la fitness or hour im sure i will come in and work out at this gym on my visits to scottsdale this really has been the best gym that ive been to in arizona thanks for everything independence gym its been real as a lifetime fitness patron i struggle giving independence even stars but i realize they are not advertising lifetime amenities or lifetime prices so i am reviewing them accordingly my boyfriend just joined independence so i figured i would give it a try with a one week free pass im not looking to replace lifetime but to have a gym closer to home for weekend visits the gym itself is just okay there is absolutely no organization to the equipment its just all over the place that being said once i wondered around and found the equipment i was looking for it was in good shape my typical workout consists of resistance type exercises wit h bands and balls and then some cardio they did have all the equipment i needed to complete my workout but no space to do it the entire gym is covered with equipment and no open space most of the cardio equipment is in decent shape but ill warn you the first treadmill by the trainers station is completely out of sync avoid it at all costs ultimately this is a clean no frills type of gym i decided not to join primarily because nobody tried to sell me a membership and i really didnt need one when i arrived on my first day i was literally given a pass asked no questions about my fitness goals and given no tour or explanation of the facility once my membership lapsed no one called to see if i liked the gym or wanted to join in fact i emailed about a one day special posted on their website but was told that they couldnt honor it because it was expired by one day yet it was still on the website i would have joined for the right price but nobody seemed too concerned either way i read all the posts before i wrote this review and there is some truth in the less than stellar reviews such as some weights are not labeled machines are intermingled with leg machines a bit cramped now some of the untrue items are unfriendly staff dirty or smelly locker rooms no air conditioning gym for insiders none of that is true ive been at this gym over a year and found it to be one of the cleanest gyms ive ever belonged to the ac unit did break down over the summer and it was repaired shortly after as far as an insiders gym well many whom belong to this gym are competitors and are extremely focused on their workouts and diets and this may come off to others as being rude or unfriendly or snobbish dont get me wrong some are rude and unfriendly but its unfair to classify the whole place as such for a non corporate independent gym this please is as good as it gets this gym is great if ever a rating deserved stars this is it the gym would be perfect if it were not for the fact that there are seriously personal trainers in this gym at all times and they often act and behave as if they have carte blanche that aside everything else is perfect the gym is seldom crowded the staff is friendly and the price is amazing at per month way better than club la fitness but with half of the amenities if your looking for a real gym this it this place has definitely improved over the years specifically there arent any more tools managing the place people including all staff are pretty cool and trainers are nice too oh yes and they regularly play good music like sirius octane no more justin beiber miley cyrus or rhinanna free weights go up to track and extra cross fit equipment are a bonus not a lot of fat people or old crotchety types that monopolize machines while they read the newspaper rates are good and parking is ample they are laid back about bringing in guests too owner seems like a very reasonable person my only complaint at this point is the gym closes at pm on sunday it they kept it open until pm id upgrade to stars i decided to give independence another try because my boyfriend said that it had got much better since theyve expanded the space he was right its still nothing fancy but its better lit and doesnt make me claustrophobic ive been scoping out the trainers over my last few visits and they seem pretty intense theyve got people doing football drills across the gym and throwing boxing bags around im not sure i can handle any of that yet but it looks like a good workout for sure absolutely the best gym dollar for dollar in the valley they have recently expanded which gives the gym a really roomy feeling great machines that are maintained and clean plenty of bumper plates for crossfit or olympic lifting and a wide open turf area for sprinting tire flipping and sled pushing the people who workout here are serious about fitness and very friendly its a cool crowd unlike some big chain gyms in the area lots of trainers use this gym and are independent contractors so you can choose from a variety of expert trainers the staff are accommodating and friendly mark the manager really cares about the satisfaction of his members and josh up front is super cool inexpensive clean no b s and plenty of fit people and pretty women to keep you motivated ive been a member now for years and plan on re uping in january i should have written a review before but i thought yelp was for restaurants only this gym can accomodate anyone from a serious body builder to a newbie which is me lots of free weights and machines there is a sprint track for pushing sleds lifting tractor tires and lunges they have different classes from boot camps to body combats they have full locker rooms with showers or if you like there is a key rack and cubbies best of all their motto your calorie burning weight lifting results getting gym is absolutely true there is no bs you go in workout and leave there is really nothing else to do there except workout but if you want help or have questions there are always people trainers and staff that want to assist you the best part is that it is a gym and not a pick up spot stars i like not waiting for weights or equipment i like being able to look at myself in the mirror and i like being able to call for a spot while im in the middle of a pr to make sure i dont have to bail a lift perks of this gym space traffic to the gym is relatively light even at rush hour and even when its crowded its never bad enough where youre bumping up into other bros oh and if you have a problem with bros at the gym or any hilarious gym stereotype get over it unless youre doing curls in the squat rack youre fine goingturbro diversity of equipment ive leaving this at five stars in spite of this gym lacking a true running track i cant stand treadmills because you cant control your speed with only your legs and that just isnt natural seriously this kind of thing could save your life if independence were a man id slap him in the face for all the treadmills he owned but as friends because the running track in the back of the gym is enough for me running is the bane of my existence and any more than a mile is likely preceded by a puff on the old inhaler since most of my long distance running is outside and i happen to be allergic to palo verde having a short distance track for sprinting skipping spinning and rolling is a must lifting bro there are two deadlift areas with powercages and two additional squat racks there are four barbell bench press stations and one each of incline and decline then there are a number of incline decline and flat benches across the main free weight area which is lined with a good number of dumbbells up to pounds other stuff independence has everything from heavy bags and foam rollers to yoga mats and plyo boxes hell they even have bosu balls if youre into that kind of thing im not aware of the class schedule yoga posing some group fitness classes but thats what their website is for i think its actually out of date you get what you get the mens bathrooms are decently equipped and maintained and although the number of lockers is far fewer than what youd expect at a bigger gym there are always empty ones ill keep going to independence for as long as i live in the area despite my glowing review i urge everyone to consider other gyms i dont need a bunch of yelpers crowding up my grunting space dost thou even hoist worked out here twice while in phoenix last week i have never been to a gym with more focused and hardworking members and it was the first time i have ever been in a gym where more people were training their lower body than their upper body as an college athlete i found this gym to be set up perfectly for getting the most bang for my buck out of my workout and even though there were lots of people training i never felt crowded or slowed down i got more done in minutes than i usually get done in an hours also if you are someone who uses trainers i would recommend checking this place out the trainers actually knew what they were doing and their clients were clearly getting outstanding workouts for once i could work out without wincing at the harmful andor useless exercises that im used to seeing trainers prescribe their clients i received a free two day pass to independence and after the first day i quit la fitness and signed up here this is a serious gym for people trying to improve themselves good place to put your headphones in and just lift ive been going here for about months now and i cant complain id feel weird giving a gym stars unless they offered something ridiculous like free massages personal training and fat shaming well maybe not the last one but independence gym is still a great gym loads of people that are serious about their health plenty of room and equipment and friendly staff likewise after having eavesdropped on a few of their personal training sessions i can conclude that these guys really know their stuff i dont see anybody doing silly exercises that look like some exotic birds mating ritual its all useful and effective exercises with great coaching all in all a great place out standing gym has some great trainers there too randy mae knows hot to get results recommend him to all whom needs a trainer a very clean and very friendly staff as well members whom will motivate your physical desires to the fullest all ages races a welcome sight whatever youre looking for in a gym you can find here oly lifting to prowler sleds to cardio machines theyre fully equipped for whatever you need and they have belts chalk dip belts rubberbands and plenty more to service their customers the employees are friendly and helpful as well which makes for a great gym experience they just purchased several new sets of bumper plates which shows that independence is always looking to update to please its customers its the best gym in the valley this gym is exactly that a gym and i love it this isnt a place to show off your fancy new workout routine or coolest gym gadgets the members are seriously into fitness and everyone is extremely respectful the only problem is it gets a bit crowded with the after work crew as of gyms do they are however open close to hrs a day i love this place i was posted to the phoenix area for a short term work assignment and needed a place to work out for a few weeks i told them how long i was going to be in town and they quoted me a very reasonable low even flat rate minimal paperwork too no b s with initiation fees recurring charges two month minimum or anything else friendly staff personal trainers are available but dont hassle you if you want to be left alone and do your own thing plenty of space and equipment so you can get through and get your workout in even when its crowded some of the stuff is older but everything is very well maintained and receives plenty of tlc best deal in the area no one else comes close and i looked it was a great gym my trainer works here and i work out here once in a while with him its really a great facility can get a little short on space during the normal peak hours but it is a very versatile gym that has everything any type of workout program would call for this gym has improved tremendously over the last eight years ive been a member the most recent two owners have put a lot of sweat equity and investment into the facilities and satisfying their customers be forewarned this is not a chi chi gym weights take up about half the floor but the people are nice and personable the trainers really take ownership and most important its not so popular that you cant jump on the equipment you need they could use an equipment update ill keep my fingers crossed for that this place is great some of the equipment may be a little old and maybe the locker rooms are not the quality of a lifetime or la fitness but its about the best gym i have ever used motivation and dedication pour out of this place this is a gym you go to when you actually want to see results whether you are working with a trainer or just getting after it yourself they have a nice dumbbell selection and they have literally every machine you could ever need or at least the ones that matter i have been to corporate gyms for years now and i can honestly say that this gym is on the top of my list so i just moved down the street from this gym all i have to say is this is one of the best gyms i have ever been in im not just talking about the equipment which let me tell you they have everything you could ever want to build muscle and endurance dumbbells up to power racks with bumper plates turf run way with sleds and tires this place is like a play ground for athletes aside from that my favorite part of this gym is the environment everyone in this place is there to work hard and get results you dont see people on their phones or doing exercises that dont make any sense the trainers know what they are talking about from what i can over hear ive never actually had a session with one of them peak hours never seem too busy to me you can always get your workout in without really waiting too long or having people jack your weights or machine lol price is more than fair i know it sounds too good to be true but this place is a diamond in the rough i would recommend this place to anyone who is highly driven to continue their fitness journey or start one but dont take my word for it come check it out see you guys there absolutely love this gym i cant stand a lot of the chains like la or because theyre always so overcrowded and overpriced independence is a great place for people that want to lift and has an excellent range of dumbbells and hammer strength machines i hadnt ever done any personal training but after watching the trainers here and overhearing the tricks and advise they were giving their clients i decided to give it a try my trainer dom has really shown me how to take things to the next level and i think a lot of the trainers at this gym would thats the culture here people are very friendly out everything they have into it while theyre there i am not going to lie this gym has a variety of equipment for everyone from you average joe to you bodybuilding competitor but the front office staff is horrible they just seem like they dont want to be there and they are very unhelpful i love the gym it self just not the staff this place is awesome i have been a member here for years now and couldnt be happier i used to belong to one of the major chain gyms and it was fine for what i needed but it always felt cold and sterile at independence the staff and trainers are also very nice and you always see smiling faces the people that work out here are also more friendly and focused on their workouts i hate going to the gym and seeing it full of women dressed up and people having full on conversations on equipment that i am waiting to use this is not the case at independence these people are serious about fitness the membership fee is very reasonable the only drawback is that unlike a major chain gym you cannot bounce around to different clubs if you travel a lot which i do not my only hesitation posting stars is that more people will join and then the gym will be too packed haha i have been going here for almost a month it is clean and the staff is very nice and helpful this is a wonderful place to strive for goals i give independence gym stars due to the high energy positive atmosphere perfection is an impossible standard but the persistent effort to improve allows for the closest imaginable comprehension to what perfection would be like in this physical life i am glad to be a member of the independence gym family it had been years since i had set foot in this gym but after seeing it recently i wished i lived closer looks great it took years before good ownership took over this place i have seen the name change at least half a dozen times in the past decade and two or three times in the matter of a month a few years back they finally have their isht together here if you want a koosh experience this is not the gym for you here you will see a variety of skill levels all trying to improve on their health anyone from a beginner to national renowned body builders its a real gym and the cheaper membership price is great too i saw comments about the staff not being pleasant my experience has been good with the staff overall this gym is a great local spot benefits a month membership if you have a trainer large and lots of equipment and space for floor exercises personal trainers great location just south of old town worth mentioning parking can sometimes be difficult due to a shared parking lot not a beginners gym limited cardio machines auto pay for membership some of their personal trainers have great groupons online to try before you commit i love the atmosphere its not a social environment everyone is there for the same reason gains i dont feel judged at all like i did at a corporate gym however the hours for this place on the weekend really need adjusting to close at on a saturday saturday is like a weekday basically people work and would like to go to the gym afterward i am highly disappointed i cant do a good work out tonight because they are closed at least until pm i know its in scottsdale and everyone there likes to go to old town and show off their hot bods but some of us are still working on our superlame what gym closes at on saturday love this place i loved going here everyone made me feel welcome my addiction to physique was born in this gym i highly recommend investing in a personal trainer though they teach you to have confidence in the gym this gym has been my gym for about years i love how friendly everyone is but more importantly the equipment is awesome i love the turf field great for sprints with the sleds etc independence has great hours the only problem is that it gets pretty busy from pm but thats to be expected beware pros nothing compared to other gyms its trash cons front counter staff is awful and rude locker room is incredibly smallas you enter you have to walk sideways no paper towels in locker room just a blow dryer during a workout whos going to wait minutes for a blow dryer you will see everyone drying their hands on their shirt because thats really the only option hours on weekends some equipment is so old and disgusting mirrored workout roomfor yoga posing balance balls in the back is always locked when i asked to use it front counter staff rolled their eyes and finally unlocked it for me advice think twice about joining this gym pay close attention to the small things when testing this place out the worst thing about this gym is the poor attitude of the front counter not only the i dont wanna be here attitude they have no problems expressing it worst gym ive ever went to in my life experience over years of gyms i went in today to check it out and as soon as i walked in i knew this was the gym for me it has tons of free weights and free weight equipment a couple squat racks and designated areas for deadlifting they have a turf area that you can do sprints tire flips and push weighted sleds they also have a nice variety of cardio machines the locker rooms are kept very nice and clean overall its a great gym and reasonably priced was in the hilton garden inn old town scottsdale about miles away and needed a good workout at a gym as opposed to the hotel gym which is always a joke this gym was awesome with all perfectly working equipment and they let me train for free since it was my first time reminded me of some of the great golds and powerhouse gyms i have been in back in the day out here in california great job running and setting up that gym equipment by body part if all gyms could be like yours tim jakubowski carlsbad ca so while visiting some family in arizona this past weekend one of my goals was to visit this gym since i have heard and seen so much about it through my instagram inspirations following first visit is free such a plus and once i walked into the gym is was so exciting it was very clean and organized they even have a turf and sleds to play around with haha it was a great experinece and i will defiantly be going there when i visit scottsdale again love this gym i have been to plenty of gyms across the country independence has an abundance of equipment squat racks a track cardio machines posing room and my favorite a ton of highly motivated people its nice to work out among the best and this is where youll get it i love this gym by far the best gym i have ever had a membership at i have been a member since july and honestly it was the best decision people are extremely friendly great workout environment along with awesome personal trainers this isnt a beginners gym but if you are serious about making a life change or competing in a competition then you have to give this place a try great gym going to miss it dearly i think it has a lot of potential but its basically a trainers gym which is fine but it should be private then a lot of bikini body builders use this facility which i find really motivating but they also take themselves too seriously and do not share equipment very well like they said in other reviews the front desk is really rude one girl with glasses in particular i wish i could give it more stars because i think this gym has come a very long way when they make a few changes and teach some customer service to the front desk ill raise my rating this gym has everything you want and very little you dont no sauna who wants to see naked old men anyway no pool but theyve got sleds a ton of box jumps and ropes never lacking pull up bars or free weights along with lots of machines that are glimmering clean an under appreciated aspect are the weirdly motivational pictures hanging throughout check it out you wont regret it ive been to this gym on of my visits to phoenix this year and it is the best gym in town let me make sure everyone understands when i say this is the best gym in town i mean a gym not a health club or exercise facility this is a gym in the sense of the word gym people in here work hard and mean business location great easy to find location with a large parking lot and a perfectly located supplement shop right next door just in case you need to stock up before or after a workout staff from the interactions i have had with the staff only a few they are pretty cool the guy i met the first time i came in was awesome and hate myself for not remembering his name he gave me a free day pass since i was only in town for days and was very appreciative of my volunteer emt work the second time i came in there wasnt much conversation but everyone i met was courteous they are very fair on their day rates at day after you have come in after your first visit im not sure what their monthly membership is but im sure its fair they have a large staff of trainers whom ive watched a little and are pretty darn good at what they do amenities so this place is perfect for the regular gym goer entire area dedicated to machine weights huge dumbbell and barbell area i think i counted flat barbell benches incline barbell benches and decline barbell bench dumbbell benches incline dumbbell benches and straight benches dumbbells go all the way up to i think with is impressive cardio is grouped together and may not be huge but plenty to choose from rows of stair climbers multiple rows of treadmills and multiple of elliptical and stationary bikes then you have the back stretch of the facility they have a stretch of turf that looked about like yards long for whatever your heart desires there were tons of sleds for pushing or pulling boxes and kettle bells for crossfit stuff and then my favorite beautiful squatdeadlift racks and these are very nice units the back of that room has punching bags and then pull up bars and ab stands all in all this gym is the bees knees of gyms if you are serious about getting your gainz on this is your place hands down also just a note you dont have to be a pro or gym rat to work out here there are all shapes and sizes just give it your all when you here joined this gym after moving here from nebraska almost years ago the price is good but the gym in general is great if you are looking for a more straightforward gym meant for training this is the place staff is great and they keep the place very clean turf area for cross training and has all the traditional equipment you could ask for great gym people are very focused and on the mission to workout lots of people are in amazing shape that is very motivating there are a lot of people who you can ask for advice most people know what are they doing if you need more then just advice then get a trainer i had very positive experience with gregg block he is an amazing sweet great open minded and has very nice positive energy highest quality gym ive been to with the greatest staff this gym motivates me to work harder must check it out}
{58175, IHOP, 1201 S Boulder Hwy Henderson NV 89015, i love when chain restaurants can still produce homemade tasting items and provide excellent service their seasonal breakfast items iced coffees with to go cups and friendly staff will have me coming back we went here on and let me say please go to a different location i had to send back two yes two breakfast plates the first breakfast meal was cold and loaded with grated cheese i asked for extra chives and bacon but when i asked what happened i was told that the restaurant was out of chives i couldnt locate the extra bacon to save my life and never requested for extra cheese the second breakfast requested was for the sirloin tips and eggs we received a burnt up mess but at least the manager on duty was able to identify what is was on the plate now lets get to the spanish speaking in the back involving two employees complaining about another table bitching about their breakfast too news flash i speak read and write in spanish thank you very much you never know who can and its just very unprofessional so i say that the cooks and servers should take a look at the pictures of how meals should look before sending it out if it looks like crap your customers will assume it taste like crap too im so glad i took pictures of the meals and sent them along w my experience to the ihop manager some additional training is needed their sirloin tips are to die for the best value tasty fast food dine in meal to be had across this great country for the most part the staff are excellent and the restrooms clean weve been travelling the usa for months repeating our holiday of last year been coming to the us since and had never been to ihop until the last trip i regret not trying the place decades ago now i know what i have been passing up they leave the other fast food joints for dead came here with some family who live locally for some after church breakfast recently ihops are pretty much the same all over so i wont go into detail on what was ordered but what is worth mentioning is the service it sucked our drinks took forever it took way too long to place our order and it took even longer to get the food to the table apparently the waitress that we had that day was notorious for being sub par during a previous visit she had forgotten about the table all together at the end of the day if you actually like what ihop has to offer mediocre food atmosphere and service than look no further but should you happen to actually care about the the quality of your experience try the omelet house im really surprised about the star rating as one person said it was very good food but only gave them stars cuz it was ihop how is that fair my daughter and i were seated immediately the restaurant wasnt crowded at all so we got service very quick although it took us a little while to figure what we wanted this was the very best ihop ive ever been to the food looked just like the picture which was surprising since no restaurants food looks like their pictures anywhere i was so happy to see the pancakes so perfect there were only a few people working one waiter manager i think thats what he was and a cook the restaurant was very clean the server was polite and attentive and again the food was perfect hopefully my visit was the norm because i do plan on returning for some more of those lightly browned pancakes i really dont know what these other star raters are talking about maybe the stars were aligned and the pancake gods reigned down maple flavored fairy dust on me that day because the food was terrific and the staff did their jobs if you want some good ihop food go here and get it why oh why cant i get any consistency at restaurants one day its excellent the next not so much why so i go back to this ihop because today is cent stack of pancake day http ihopllc fbmta commembersviewmailing aspxmailingid i walk in and am immediately seated by a young lady who seemed like she was just there to do her job and would be so happy if it were the end of her shift this was all subtle we are seated and in less than what felt like maybe minutes little ms jazmin came to get our drink order as usual i got water and my daughter decided to try their new watermelon fizzy drink which she liked btw when she brings our drinks back we order stacks each of the promotional pancakes meanwhile a hispanic couple comes in and is seated at the opposite end of the room from us about minutes later a couple of middle aged women come in and our seated in the booth next to us my daughter comments that the hispanic couple just received their order giving the situation the benefit of the doubt i explain that maybe they put in their order before us then a few minutes later the two middle aged women received their food i jumped out of that seat and with aggravation and disdain asked them where in the hell are me and my daughters pancakes i told them that we have been waiting minutes for pancakes while these other people have their food and our already eating the waitress grabs a plate of pancakes and says to me their coming right out so i go sit down but get right back up and ask for the manager i could see that the pancakes she grabbed were not actually ours since she was not on her way to our table in the end a young hispanic guy around yrs old came to our table and asked what happened and i explained and he said that we didnt have to pay for anything and asked did we want anything else from the menu i wont lie the pancakes were still very good my daughter and i even took an order each of pancakes home i never did get that business card jazmin promised stars for the free food the apology and the pancakes to go side note everyone waiting tables and the hostess were all very young women there were no authoritative figures anywhere in the restaurant management was not there when the cats away the mouse will play thats all i have to say ihop isnt bad its just not that good either i used to think ihop was much better several years ago they still have good pancakes and french toast but unfortunately i dont think they do well with most other dishes especially outside of breakfast the sausage seems like it was not cooked but more like boiled or something hashbrowns were also pretty good i guess but generally i can get just as good or better at several other resturants just seems like the overall quality of the food and service just isnt what it used to be i would actually rather go to even dennys these days whereas a few years ago i would have chosen ihop first they seemed to remove several items off the menu that i loved this time around i didnt see any types of skillets on the menu which is dissapointing for me because that is one of my favorite breakfast options the quality of the food is down and the price of the food is a bit high considering the lower quality also just want to add a comment about the service we were seated in a corner and none of the servers noticed us for nearly minutes not exactly the best service they should be able to do much better five stars because the food just tastes amazing must have a secret recipe for the funny face pancake came in on a sunday morning at am instantly sat in a booth our server was quick with our food and drinks she was also on top of drink refills and checked in on us to make sure we had everything we needed will be back this is definitely our family go to when the kids are wanting breakfast for dinner very close to home always a fun time when meeting with family or friends for breakfast service has always been great you could hear the servers in the back gossiping about people once the manager went in they all went back to work our server was good newbie the food was okish my hashbrown was hard ontop and the eggs were more raw than med well one bacon was hard close to burned while the other was cooked perfect i tried the berry crepe id give it a out ot id rather have a pancake instead overall its an ordinary ihop nothing special id rather go to a small family owed bf place this is my go to ihop theyre always on point whenever i go at least and get my orders right i know ihop is a chain but you can never go wrong with the pancakes or waffles theyre great ayce pancakes are also a grand deal everything was perfect or waiter was excellent i like ice tea with lemon i hate when they do a refill they never give you more lemon but he did and i like it when they do better tip when they do because they paid attention to what i order also the food was very good and fresh two thumbs up ihop great food and filipe made our dining experience a perfect one the food was cooked quickly but everything was done perfectly stars just for the manager on duty right now i didnt get her name but she was a delight my brother and i came here with my month old nephew he was a little cranky and my brother started getting embarrassed because he didnt want to disturb the tables around us i reminded him that we are at a family restaurant but he didnt care my brother ended up walking outside with the baby til our food came out my nephew was still not having it the manager came over to make sure everything was ok and did everything she could to help calm down my nephew got him a coloring pad showed him how to color grabbed a small bowl of honeydew mellons my brother was trying to keep my nephew from throwing his food on the floor something he loves to do and she told him not to stress over it because they have vacuums and brooms to clean up with given its probably not a big deal for most people it helped calm both my nephew and brother down and we were all eventually able to finish our meals at the table}
{65484, Balkan Bakery, 1107 E Bell Rd Ste 16 Phoenix AZ 85022, i love the balkan bakery easily the best bread products in phoenix produced on site every morning so get in there early before they are sold out they are also now offering morning lunchtime foods and sit in tables this guy makes the best stuff i love the bureks our fav is the spinach french bread is wonderful do get there early what an amazing bakery and such a friendly family i didnt know they moved but i passed their new location and thought oh another balkan bakery i showed up the following week and saw the friendly face of one of the workers i think he may be the owner and got a i forget its name filo dough stuffed with spinach and feta cheese its delicious that is one of the only things i really get here sometimes i get the kisra which is a small boomerang shaped salty bread really well priced and freshly baked and obviously delicious bread come back yes i do often since moving here years ago ive been trying to find a good bread bakery so glad i stopped by daily fresh baked loafs of bread not a big selection and thats so they dont have to cut corners price is quite reasonable half of what i expected to pay the cream puffs were amazing the salted bread stick i think its called kafta is incredibly soft and wonderful im headed home to cut a fat slice of my dark rye with no caraway seeds i will be headed back for the balaclava soon soon soon im glad i yelped been looking for a good bakery for a while must visit if you love fresh baked goods really enjoyed their bread and cream puffs get there early or call to reserve bread because they run out quickly i was there at pm and they were sold out of almost everything they have these hot pastries with a flaky croissant like crust that are stuffed with cheese cheese and spinach beef or beef and potato that are awesome they also have different kinds of sweet desserts like tiramisu baklava cream puffs and whatever the baker felt like making that day the rolls and pretzels are also fresh and tasty they also now serve coffee which i look forward to trying this is a family owned business and they are very friendly and do not judge you no matter how many sweets you buy they also will take the time to tell you what is in the different items and give you recommendations my recommendation is you try this place out great service good food and reasonable prices they have made me a regular customer my family and i have been going to balkan bakery for two years now and its a great place for fresh baked bread jay is always so helpful and nice they do run out of bread early so get there fast the have a great selection of bread desserts and to accompany them coffee the menu isnt huge but the few items they have are good the coffee i had the cappuccino was okay nothing special the spinach burek bread filled with spinach and cheese was fantastic and so was the keks torta chocolate coffee cake the service was excellent and the pricing was fair the place is pretty small but they have some seating outside if the seating inside is full simply the best bakery in phoenix metro area hands down now their new location at th street and bell rd has some european goodies that are hard to find anywhere else and the pricing is great as well one thing i would suggest is that you call in an order if youre coming later in the day because the afternoon rush can leave you empty handed but if you call it in they make extra and put one on the side for you the only downside is that i cant live off of burek and the pastries but i do attempt to a few times a week as a bosnian myself i cant believe that i found this place by seeing the segment on them on food network what a shame it took me so long to discover them the menu isnt huge basic and simple but the things they make they are the best at it pies burkes are fantastic and as close to homemade as you can get in phoenix all for a reasonable price they offer nice variety of breads something for everyone all fresh and made right there cant beat that and as a cherry on top there is a small selection of european goods just to cure homesickness all in all this is a bakery so know what to expect grab a great bread for breakfast or burke for lunch of course they will run out of fresh bread later in the evening more kudos to them for keeping everything fresh and not piling up stale products great bureks and amazing coffee i will be back just to grab some fresh bread when i am not just walking there everything i tried here was excellent yelp reviews were right on the cheese burek was a great discovery one of the best bakeries in town best eastern european bakery in the state bureks are out of this world friendly service go here and leave happy love this place the cream puffs and cappuccinos are fantastic true european flare a must try i needed to bring a great desert to a family gathering for sunday lunch three days ago where can you find one open on sunday especially one that sells baklava the balkan bakery bested my expectations the baklava was better than my yia yias and thats not something you proclaim at a family gathering opah not a coffee drinker but everything else here is excellent cream puff bread excellent been dropping by here for a few months now with my mom and im very glad to have found this little gem burek cappuccino kifla delicious desserts but you have to get there between opening and a little after lunch am to pm if you want to get your hands on the goodies cappuccinocoffee is the best ive ever had here in the states given im sure its imported since he doesnt sell the beans has no bitter after taste its delish so try it and dont let that huge square piece of meringue intimidate your sweet tooth because it is amazingly not sickly sweet as what everyone is used to with a cappuccino is awesome and please have a spinach cheese burek you will not regret it my year old is so picky and so far she has enjoyed everything from here well not the coffee obviously but she enjoys their little green bottles of sparkling water with a burek excellent food great choice of really delicious bosnian pitas excellent customer service with a smile best bakery for bread and pita in phoenix bar none the balkan bakery in phoenix was a real treat it is a small place with a few tables inside and tables outside in a small strip mall it could be easy to missed if you do miss it turn around and come in for a treat the cappuccino report you like strong coffee this is the place and so flavorful my honey is the coffee expert and she rated it very highly i have not heard her so excited about coffee in a long time next have a burek in one of several flavors beef cheese or spinach there were four of us and we tried all of them and were pleased to find a dish none of us had ever had before and all of us enjoyed you can watch them preparing the burek where they start with an oh so thin dough add a small long pile of the filling roll roll roll it into a long rope then with a butter brush and wrap it and bake it is very good now i had to try some of the bread and i must say i enjoyed it the next course was baklava different from other baklavas i have had but the balkan treat was loved by all go enjoy try something new wow amazing bakery anybody from europe would appreciate it it gives you a taste of back home their burek is delicious and they have plenty of varieties there are also breads and meats and desserts love love love this place they do an amazing job their burek is amazing everything there is so fresh delicious best european pastries as well this is a neat little bakery their selection isnt very big but what they do have is delicious their burek is the best if you are looking for european pastriesbread this is the place we loved eating there the cheese burek and the sweets are also yummy but lately we find that the cheese filling its not as creamy as it was we liked it more when it was nice and creamy now the cheese is more dry i dont know if it dries because you keep it warm or you changed something in the recipe its still good though keep up the good work had to write another review hey when its this good it needs to be shared you know kind of like screaming it off the roof tops yeahhh d e l i c i o u s everything amazing fresh tasty spinach cheese bureks light and fluffy fresh baked breads my favorite is the kifla just try it if you like bread and who doesnt than youll like the kifla but ya get there a little bit before lunch to get some and if you want it fresh oh and dont forget to get a cappuccino very yummy cant imagine dipping the kifla in anything else go and try them promise you will love them their cheese burek is to die for id eat it everyday if i could my family buys bread from here every sunday its delicious basically everything they sell is amazing must try if you havent already it sucks that my previous review from is gone granted it was for their old location but still the fact that i wrote a review for the new location as well and that one is also missing makes me go hmmm either way the food is still just as awesome as it although i havent been in awhile jasenko who is one of the owners remembered me he called me out on my failure to visit lol oh and never ever let anyone go ahead of you when there are only two bureks left or any number of bureks for that matter or you will be left looking longingly at the empty case once that person leaves truestory lol yay for cervapi though whew what are bureks they are freshly made filo stuffed yummy goodness you can have stuffed with cheese beef or spinach once they are gone and thats it until the next day as they are made fresh each morning so get there early or you will end up like me looking longingly at the empty case cervapi is equally delicious to try to explain what they are would not do them justice but man they are so good they also have yummy desserts to choose from coke in the old fashion bottles score but seriously great customer service topped off with equally delcious food a big win in my book i mean what more can you ask for ps you can call ahead and preorder bureks to ensure that you have one waiting for you when you arrive the cream puffs were absolutely lovely not too sweet and definitely more ish they also sell bosnian food which i didnt have time to try but the guy behind the counter was happy to answer all my curious questions about the food fantastic it has been a long time since i have enjoyed cevapi and ajvar like this it is great to have found a place that reminds me in a positive way of being in yugoslavia thanks for making me smile}

{84165, Yola's Cajun Fried Chicken, 270 E. Hunt Hwy Ste 20 San Tan Valley AZ 85143, we have a new local restaurant to support yolas is at the ne corner of hunt hwy and bella vista tucked in the corner where the r r pizza used to be it had only been open for about a week so not yet busy walking in it is a very open space with simple new orleans madi gras decorations sean is the front of house and is wonderfully nice helpful about the menu and eager to please we ordered the piece chicken you can get regular or spicy we ordered spicy and you get one side and a biscuit we chose cajun fries and then ordered an extra side so we could try the red beans and rice this is very good homestyle food the flavors are very much louisiana so very different than any food you can find around here so if you are looking for new flavors this is the place for you the three piece chicken was a breast a thigh and a leg but you can order any piece you want the outer crust was crisp hot and wonderfully lip tingling spicy and i love spice the chicken meat tender and falling off the bone the fries were good thin and spicy and the red beans and rice very smoky rich and laden with ham hock pieces as it should be i mentioned to my husband that if you were in louisiana and went to grandmas house for sunday dinner this is exactly what youd get they also have okra sweet and spicy coleslaw and peach cobbler they also give a discount for our military and fd so very community minded as well as good old fashioned food prices are very good for the piece meal restaurant is clean staff is so friendly and owners are local its the perfect business to support stopped by this place for the first time today and lets just say i was not disappointed the owner and staff were so polite and friendly the ambiance is that new orleans feel and the food ordered to go the three piece fish jambalaya red beans and rice and fried zucchini portions are great and the food was extremely satisfying they are off to the right start great fried chicken great recipe i cant wait to go back highly recommended the team was very helpful and courteous the best fried chicken ive had since eating in the south and actually better i just spent over here to feed my family of five and now im in the jack in the box drive thru everyone tried their food they ordered and wont even eat it think im not telling the truth i have receipts to prove prices were high but i thought that if the food was good it was with it terribly disappointed food was horrible we had to throw it away chicken was dry chewy and inedible fries and okra were cold and also not good again we threw them away i was really hoping this place was going to be great so disappointing the fish was amazing the cheesecake was also great i did not care for the peach cobbler something was just wrong with it but everything else was amazing the staff was very kind alex you are amazing you are the main reason i come in your smile and kindness is amazing your food is out of this world and soon the line will be out the door went on advice from a friend and was not disappointed fish and red beans and rice were great big portions of fish with just the right amount of batter husband and wife owners were friendly and very attentive will definitely go back to try the chicken this is new orleans style food not kfc so they do add some spice amazing food wish i had this food back in southern california sean was extremely coolfriendly talked a little basketball made me feel right at home good portions good pricing great owners wish them nothing but the best stars i eat here at least once a week and my kids really enjoy it too everything is super flavorful and delicious way better than bland kfc and walmart chicken just spent on a carry out order that was disgusting the chicken was extremely greasy the cajon fries were limp and seasoned so much they were inedible the crab cakes lacked crab and should be called bread cakes and the best was the peach cobbler the ice cream was on top of the peach cobbler in the same plastic container it doesnt take a professional chef to realize the ice cream is going to melt and cause everything to become a soup like consistency this was a carry out order we were so disappointed because this could have been a great restaurant looks like it will just be another restaurant to go out of business in san tan valley went here for lunch the fried chicken was amazing the greens were really good as well my husband had the cat fish the pieces were a very nice size and seasoned to perfection i highly recommend yolas if you are looking for a nice cajun food place great place to eat alex was super friendly and helpful the chicken was delicious and you could taste that it was made to order the crabcakes where awesome too we will definitely be back we have always have had the best experience here the food is so delicious and fresh and also the staff is so friendly i can not say enough of how much we love this restaurant very good food and friendly service they also offer a law enforcement and military discount im writing this review as im finishing my food i ordered the piece mild chicken with red beans and rice amazing i am not a fan of fried chicken but this place is great the beans were so good and the chicken fell right off the bone the girl at the front i forgot her name sorry was super duper nice which is refreshing will definitely be coming back great food love the mom and pop places to eat my favorite was the crab cakes but everything is great this is my new go to place for fried fish ive been here twice and have received excellent food both times we did go into the evening for a dine in experience i feel the need to respond to some other reviews because reading them actually had me pause a little before returning for a second visit if you eat at mcdonalds on a regular basis you probably do want to skip this place your palate most likely isnt refined enough to appreciate the subtle nuances of the cajun spice blend or the fact that the oil in the fryer is a perfect match for the style of food prepared i love their fried okra here its the best ive had but the reason that i really appreciate it is because its lightly coated and you can still tell its a vegetable that you are eating and i actually enjoy the flavor of vegetables the coleslaw is fabulous for the same reason there is actually more cabbage than sauce the sour and sweetness heighten and enhance the vegetables rather than just trying to cover them all up with mayonnaise if you want hot crispy fried food dont cover it up do you know why your mcfries come in an open mcpaper mcbox because fried foods get soggy almost instantly when they are steamed if you are going to have take out dont call it in too early dont let it sit in a closed box it will get soggy every time i really enjoyed hearing blues music for a while on our second visit i think that if they played jazz and blues music exclusively it would improve the experience but other than that i cant find much else to improve upon based on our two visits i really wanted to like this place but the food was horrible the fried zucchini was mushy the chicken tasted like it was cooked in really old dirty oil that also had a bit of fish taste in it im sure its because the old oil has been used to cook fried fish too many times before changing it and cleaning one of the only times i threw my food away need to go try the cajun chicken at copper basin now is this a joke chicken is tasteless soggy and seasoning is terrible and shaken on the fried breasts were boneless chicken breasts i couldnt be more disappointed this is all going in the trash the beignets are a must these are the closest thing to being in new orleans that i have ever had sorry for no pictures they were so good that we all ate them up before thinking about taking a picture this food is off the hooook i came in to an empty restaurant during lunchtime i was concerned it was empty but right away the guys who were working were so sweet and welcoming even asked me if i have any song requests i ordered the spicy fried fish red beans and rice and garlic bread with a lemonade the fish was perfectly cooked flaky and juicy with a thin crispy coating and a nice sweet heat on the spice cant wait to come back and try more please support this amazing local place i was so excited to try n support a local restaurant and i was so disappointed sorry not worth the money our first and only visit wont be back this place is not reminiscence of nawlins or louisiana and the great food found there dark and dingy got the chicken and we can do better at home with my own cajun spice mix wow this food is fantastic we had the fish delight fried chicken okra dirty rice and beignets delicious and served hot great flavor service was outstanding you owe it to yourself to try it really hope they make i}

{54578, Caldero, 7111 E Thomas Rd Scottsdale AZ 85257, i checked out caldero based upon the just drove by review on the th i just happened to be walking by i live just a couple blocks away but usually dont head west down thomas when going downtown so i didnt even know it was there i was blown away when i saw what theyd done to the building that used to be the banana thing i guess i was there for the grand opening and a bit early but when i walked in the amazing smells overwhelmed me i was just stopping in to see if they had a take out menu but i blew off the rest of my day and sampled everything i could get my hands on one of the family owners stopped by and greeted me at the bar while i was trying to decide what to do with myself in this oasis of what ive now learned is sort of nuevo mayan food or at least its new to me the decor is sort of simple but it totally is overwhelmed by what comes out on the plates i almost fell off my bar stool when i saw the folks next to me receive their nachos calderos style if i could figure out how to get the picture i annoyingly took with my b berry up here it would blow you away the fresh guacamole load up on that thing was like a meal in itself and you must try the guac i only snacked because i had to go to dinner at another location but my mind was exploding as i watched amazing seafood salad pork and chicken combinations pass by me i brought home a take out menu thats been haunting me all night i made a calendar of what im going to have this coming week they evidently serve lunch from to specials on the lunch menu so im going to have to double up on monday and wednesday price wise its not the cheapest taco in town but they arent serving tacos per se theres a taco bell about meters away if you want that stuff personally i think they are under pricing their entrees certainly the lunch menu the bar is fully stocked and theyve got beers from south of the border that ive never even heard of before and this berry fruit beer that evidently is all the rage for chicks that dont like beer i tried a sample and its like candy the staff operates like an in tune family which is pretty solid for a place that just opened up the only problem is that you might feel overwhelmed as they welcome you through the door like youre an old friend restaurants come and go like wildfire in old town but i think this one just a couple of blocks south of the beautiful people is definitely going to be around for a long time the setup is is pretty tight too the bar side is configured for dancing and the traditional restaurant side is boothy and family friendly im almost thinking that i shouldnt be telling everyone about this now i figure lunch for one at around plus booze tip and government graft dinner if you do it right with an appetizer is like if you go seafood plus booze tip and government graft if you get the nachos calderos style thats definitely a person split maybe even or come hungry and expect to be treated like family like restaurants are supposed to treat people for the last six months i have been intrigued by this little building with a sign reading coming soon caldero needless to say i wanted to see if this was just another simple mexican restaurant or something more after tonight i definitely believe it to be the ladder my wife and i had the mole with chicken and the pork stuffed poblano and i couldnt be happier i am excited knowing that this is within walking distance but i encourage all of you to drive over and check it out their happy hour specials are reasonable and you wont be dissappointed awesome chips and salsa to start had the chicken chimi and it was great service staff was excellent too decor was modern and clean highly recommend we had a great experience this week at the bar with ricardo he made some great menu suggestions chile verde pork plate and tamales and spun up some delicious drinks the salsas and dip trio which comes with the chips were amazing and the atmosphere was friendly and nice well be back this restaurant should be rated for one taco at lunch time with no sides i think not i walked out after seeing the prices i wasnt prepared to pay for a mexican lunch for one they have done a great job with this place it has been fixed up and you would never know this was formerly occupied by the smelly banana leaf i had two tacos with a side of guac it was delicious you must have the guacamole so nice to have something this good in my neck of the woods best chips and salsa hands down jalapeno bean dip is excellent the service was great they made special orders for us with no problem they are not cheap but you get quality food and good service if you want cheap go across the street to tacos jalisco i have also heard that they have really good margaritas hope to try one soon loved it wife and i looking for place to eat as we were going up and down scottsdale rd lucky she noticed the sign and we turned on thomas and pulled in was impressed at decor new and nice hostess was very helpful in giving suggestions server was also great the owner gave us sample of their caldera margarita whoohoo spicy we had regular margs instead the food was outstanding chips and salsa to start bean dip and a green chile queso wow then we shared some apps that were on special for sunday evening had and awesome dinner with drinks for less than cant say enough good things they are new just opened couple months again we really wish them luck wish was closer to home but we will be back nice bar and tvs i had the worst experience at caldero we were the only customers in the entire restaurant but it took forever to get any service we waited minutes to get our chips another minutes just for water another minutes to place our order and almost an entire hour to get our entrees we were a large group of but the wait was ridiculous good thing i had cash on hand they probably would have taken another minutes to run my debit card never again will i return to this restaurant first of all this restaurant is not traditional mexican cuisine they offer a combination of mayan and aztec flavors and dishes which i have to say makes for some delicious offerings i am a native texan meaning i hold mexican food near and dear to my heart and since moving to the scottsdale area months ago i have been searching far and wide for a mexican restaurant that i can claim as my go to spot now granted caldero may not be mexican cuisine by traditional standards but no matter because my boyfriend and i have claimed this restaurant as our place meaning we are planning on becoming regulars at caldero we have been there twice within the last week sitting at the bar both times because the owners ricardo and julia are both inviting and fun to talk to both times we have indulged in the calderita cocktail a margarita made from tropical fruit juices with just a hint of habanero its sweet and spicy and oh so good we have also been unable to resist their toritos wax peppers that have been stuffed with shrimp and cheese wrapped in bacon fried and served in a pool of a spicy chipotle sauce and a heavenly beurre blanc these are seriously one of the best things i have ever tasted in my life no exaggeration my boyfriend and i have both woke up thinking about them almost on a daily basis since first trying them they will definitely be a staple every time we return to this new surprisingly superb restaurant i want to urge everyone to give it a try because it is definitely worth it this neighborhood restaurant has undergone its rd reincarnation this time as a mexican restaurant the inside is pleasant and comfortable but unremarkable the service was outstanding although the food was ordinary my margarita was just a little too unfrozen and the chimichanga was smaller than one might expect all that aside the food was very tasty and the salsas served with the chips were very good it wasnt busy when we went so the fact that we were the only people in the place was somewhat disconcerting in any event i would definitely go back not the cheapest mexican place around but the flavors are there comfortable atmosphere and excellent service the lunch specials for less than and happy hour til will have me coming back the black beans were good and the spanish rice was fluffy and flavorful chips were thin crispy and not greasy i have come here multiple times on trips to the area service has always been great and the food is top notch on the last trip i ordered the chicken fajitas and they were great i would say it is a must try based on just my lunch salad and a margarita caldero is unique and above the average in mexican cuisine with a interesting and not average dinner menu many people who are not fans of mexican might be fans here they have several non ordinary salads and i picked the bass salad but they ran out so i went with the almond crusted chicken salad it was just the right amount of chicken that wasnt heavy or oily it was prepared nice the salad also had jicama red peppers and pecans the vegetables were cut nice and tasted well together i picked the mango dressing and it wasnt sweet but savory and interesting they also have a tamarind dressing i dont recall the name of the margarita i had but it was a tropical fruit one with a hint of habanaro pepper the margarita wasnt really sweet but was flavorful sort of a peach kind of fruit flavor with sour and the mild hot pepper hit your throat at the end of your sip in a nice way the margarita was large and does give a buzz i noticed marinated whole fish on the menu and nut crusted stuffed chillies and slow cooked beefs on the menu service was friendly and efficient met some friends for dinner sat night it was totally empty in here for a saturday evening but the friends we dined with have eaten here before and had good things to say i ordered a glass of wine and my husband tried a spicy jalapeno margarita mixed drink not bad the chips and salsa they bring to the table include three salsas one is a more a traditional salsa one is a bean dip and the other more of a creamy verde sauce our server told us the fish tacos appetizer was excellent so we ordered those i ordered the shrimp diablo and my husband ordered the seafood stew in a creamy sauce the fish tacos were just ok they werent excellent ive had far better fish tacos although i did like the mango jalapeno salsa that came on the side my entree was very spicy fitting with the name and came with black beans and i decided to try the lemon cilantro rice which was pretty good i dont think it was worth though highly overpriced for such a simple meal of a few shrimp with rice and beans my husbands meal tasted good but he said it was more reminiscent of italian flavors and nothing really mexican about it other than his sides of black beans and spanish rice one of our friends ordered a pasta dish with a cream sauce he loved previously and was disappointed when it came out with spaghetti style pasta vs the linguine hed had before although our server was friendly she was scarce we waited and waited even for our drinks after she took our drink order she apologized for the wait as she said the bartender was mia all of a sudden even our friends who had better experiences here said this evening was lackluster at best i just think it was also overpriced for what it was as a side note i was expecting a huge tequila menu and was excited to try a few but their drink menu just included wines and specialty mixed drinks im sure they have tequila at the bar but i guess i was expecting it to be featured more a buddy of mine couldnt say enough great things about this place so we met him and his girlfriend here last night for our first try it was very quiet and quite empty but that didnt turn us off i started with the calderita margarita a very large and tasty drink with a peppery kick we had the fish taco appetizer and i thought it was very good the mango salsa added a nice spicysweet flavor my entree was a seafood soup in a white sauce honestly though as i was eating it it didnt have any mexican flavor it was more of an italian style dish plus several of my clams werent steamed open which means somethings wrong the very least they shouldve removed them from the dish ive read if you eat unopened clams you can get extremely ill my wife had the shrimp diablo yes they were very hot but at bucks i thought shed get more than shrimp the chips and salsa were fine we had to keep asking for more chips and never got the salsas refilled big disappointment they did not pass the water glass test our server was sweet but hard to find what disappointed me the most was what our dining companions had to say his g friend had the calderita as well and had to send it back minutes later my buddy had to have his calderita sent back he was disappointed in his normally outstanding pasta dish they both apologized for suggesting caldero and said our experience this night wasnt indicative of their previous dining experiences there and they advertise as a tequila bar but we never saw a menu for tequilas maybe if you sit at the bar overall i thought our dishes were overpriced and lacked mexican inspired flavors our friends will be back as they had previously good experiences but we have other places we want to try so i doubt well be back wow just came back from this place and im too full to move the food was so good that it was impossible to not overeat the grilled fish tacos are super jummy full of flavor read a couple reviews on here about it being pricy and not full of flavor was kind of hesitating to go there but very glad we did i asked them to make fish fajitas they didnt have it on the menu but they made it and they were delishes my boyfriend had lamp and although he is very picky with his meat he said that this tasted very good tender and flavorful im vegetarian so cant tell you anything about meat dishes in this place but the appetizer and my fish fajitas were full of flavor very fresh and tasty bloody marys were also very good and a little spicy jummm if we ever come bask to arizona we will be visiting this place shredded beef burrito was good though not enough heat service was good definitely should visit i went in looking for a good margarita and some food i asked if they made they margarita mix fresh with real limes or used a sweet and sour mix they use a mix and add to it so i did not order a margarita i looked at the menu and decided it was too expensive for me to eat there for a cheese enchilada and sides first i really didnt t want the sides there was no ala carte menu so i opted not to eat there the place was nice and clean the customers are rude we went on a friday and it was not really busy but more people came in as it got a little later the service was great and the chips and salsa were awesome we all ordered something different and shared and the food was good and the prices were reasonable we thought the margaritas were a little shy of tequila so the owner came over and fixed them right up we will go back they changed the menu and no longer have salads or the unique items i mentioned from so we left i dont think it is necessary to drop a star since my last meal was good i live across the street from here and for months have been telling myself i would stop in i finally did and i was pleased the bf and i popped in for a late lunchearly dinner and the place was empty pm on a saturday which we found a little odd but sat down at the bar anyway bf had the calderita a margarita with jalapeno infused tequila it was too spicy for me but he liked that it wasnt overly sweetened like other margs i had the strawberry mojito which was nice and not overly sweet either the bartender brought us out some chips salsa and some green chile dip while we waited for food chips didnt appear to be homemade but i didnt care because that warm green dip was so good i coulda put it on cardboard and been happy i wasnt super hungry so i just ordered the small nachos with chicken this is at full price and i wasnt expecting the mass pile of food that was placed in front of me everything you want in a nacho was there lots of cheese black beans lots of succulent shredded chicken pico guac and sour cream love love loved it i over ate and left way too full the bf had the chicken mole and he claimed it to be his new official favorite mole their mole is a family recipe and he made sure to give compliments to the chef he got sides with his entree and one of his choices was a lemon cilantro rice i of course had to try this matter of fact i tried about bites cuz it was so good the bartender said they do a happy hour all day on sunday so im thinking the next time i get a wild hair and bar hop on sunday i have to work them into rotation the food was legit i think this place is a sleeping giant but they are not quite ready for a busy show being very picky the cruz margaritas were a bit pricey shrink the glass option i like less mix and more tequilla other than that it is good food the green salsa was interesting as i could not distinguish what type of cheese was added hoping queso fresco but probably velvetta someone recommended this place and they were right this is real mexican food right in the middle of scottsdale we ordered the tilapia chicharron and the tampiquena they were both really good the meat was tasty and juicy the salsas and chips that they serve you in the beginning are to die for great service and great environment i went to get lunch but they told me that at night they have a dj we are coming back for sure theres this smell as soon as you walk in that is kind of unpleasant bathroom esque its weird because i actually went to the bathroom and it doesnt really smell its actually pretty nice in there they have to do something about that smell im not sure what all the excitement was over the chips and salsa the chips were not as greasy as some places and actually a little thicker the red salsa was pretty good but wouldnt say the best in this area los olivos takes that prize theres this other creamy weird looking sauce they put out as well with the chips not very good at all they should just replace that with the verde sauce in the sauce bottle that they bring with the tacos i do agree that the platings very well done here we got the hot wings which were solid not the best but definitely not the worst cooked well not too small good sauce and good amount of sauce the wings probably could have used a little seasoning to them to the next level the carnitas street tacos were also pretty solid not sure if the grilled onions work here i think i wouldve preferred just the pico de gallo type topping on these they were really good though esp with the salsa verde and the salsa rojo we asked for more to eat the tacos with all in all i think ill go back and try an entree might see another star but ill probably wait for one of those mailing coupon deals the prices arent crazy but given the hh food id rather not gamble big on this one the hh prices arent great either about for pretty much every choice alcohols a bit better at about my familys favorite cant say enough about the service everyone including the owners are so gracious friendly and fast every time we visit we feel like family the food is amazing im very picky when it comes to mexican food and caldero is tops the portions are more than what you would expect and are beautifully presented my partner and i especially love the happy hour specials the barbacoa street tacos are to die for if you love true authentic mexican food at a great price you must visit caldero you will not be disapointed wow thanks yelpers for the great reviews of this wonderful restaurant i had the enchiladas one wred and the other green cilantro lime rice and refrained beans my husband had the carnitas estilo michoacan and i had to stop him from licking the plate when he finished it everything has a big rich flavor the chip were warm and fresh and we couldnt decide which of the salsas we like best generally we like to go to a different restaurant each night while on vacation but we might have to return here yummmm amazing flan great food cheap tasty drinks color me pleased during happy hour until pm or all day sunday it is for a top shelf mojito in scottsdale and for street tacos seriously what is better than that an early reviewer said expensive but compared to what taco bell drive thru i was very surprised how good the food is here i had a chicken burrito and for the price and quality i really enjoyed it the chips and salsa are amazing two different salsas happy hour is amazing the only downfall is the atmosphere they had a bootleg ufc fight on every tv like the fights you see on a weird channel just kinda weird for a mexican joint i hope this place stays around i didnt see too many people in here it seems to me that scottsdale is severely lacking in the mexican food arena as far as good food at reasonable prices screw this table side guacamole for business make it in the kitchen not to say i dont order said guacamole but let it go on record i disagree with it and i welcomed the addition of filibertos on indian bend if that tells you anything but i was really pleasantly surprised when i finally made it to caldero they have some specialty dishes on the dinner menu that look quite good but we were there for lunch so i ordered from the classics menu and truthfully if you cant make a taco im not interested in moving forward in this relationship chips and salsa are still free thats no longer a given sadly the red salsa was good with plenty of oregano and just the right kick for me the green was a queso dip and would make a lovely beverage as far as im concerned for lunch i had the chile rojo burro served enchilada style with rice and beans for did i mention this is in scottsdale hopefully they dont talk to the table side guac folks the burro was so stuffed with pork i almost wished it had a little more sauce though i loved the enchilada sauce too i went with charro beans again delicious over black or refried they also offer lemon cilantro rice in addition to the standard spanish rice i had spanish and it was just fine except for the obligatory peas everyone tosses in there our server was excellent and very friendly too im a little worried it was relatively empty on a saturday afternoon but ill be back and do my part in ensuring it stays open great service great prices great chips and salsa great margaritas great entrees really hope this place stays around one of the best mexican restaurants in the area for a long time thrilled to have something so good so close to home was bummed to see that it was practically empty on a saturday night but hoping that changes soon this place deserves to be around for a long time in a city full of great mexican restaurants its hard to differentiate yourself from the crowd lets admit it we all have our favorites so we had to admit being a bit jaded when asked to try caldero by a friend okay we admit we even put off going for a few weeks we were wrong and we fully admit our mistake see we can act maturely located on thomas east of scottsdale rd caldero impressed us with their unique mexican food at very affordable prices looking for the standard americanized mexican you wont get that here instead you will find authentic regional dishes prepared with care and handed down by the owners mother who still oversees all the sauces and the sauces are what sets caldero apart from the pack ill let you in on one of our little secrets want to judge a mexican restaurant ask to taste their mole sauce if they dont offer mole run i can vouch that the mole sauce here passed the test with flying colors great consistency not too sweet right amount of kick yep they had us at the mole full review here http schmoozeaz comblogp excellent food and service the pablano salsa was amazing i highly recommend the lemon cilantro rice and black beans for your sides recommended by another chef this proved to be a true gem delicious beautiful presentation and reasonable not bad for overpriced scottsdale ive been to calderos probably half a dozen times now and i always walk away glad that i went in the staff is always friendly and welcoming particularly the male bartendermanagerowner im not sure which one he is who always remembers me and my boyfriend when we come in the chips and salsa that they put on your table after you are seated also comes with a queso sauce that is to die for and i really wish they would put it on the menu the prices are fantastic for a sit down restaurant and the portions are more than adequate and border on generous you can order items a la carte and while most restaurants charge through the nose to do so calderos doesnt you can get a carnitas burrito for or a carne asada burrito for both of which are literally only pennies more than you would pay at fillibertos and the quality is much better they have a bunch of a la carte items and all are more than reasonably priced my favorite entree so far is the chicken empanadas plate it comes with two empanadas stuffed to the gills with white meat chicken and whatever sides you choose you get a choice of what your sides are instead of just having rice beans dumped on your plate i always request the lemon cilantro rice and the charro beans but there are many other options ive had their carnitas and their carne asada and both are juicy flavorful and have just the right amount of spice their fried ice cream is to die for so if you can save room for dessert or do what we did just went in one night for dessert alone the only thing i could think that people might need to know is that overall the food here is a bit spicier than most restaurants like garcias or macayos might make the food heer just has a little more kick to it than you might be used to from other places im not a big hot food fan but it still doesnt bother me you just may notice that your mouth is tingling a bit when you leave all in all i cant recommend this place more highly great food even better prices a friendly staff this place has everything and its my go to spot now for mexican food and im doubly lucky that its close because i wont eat mexican frood from anywhere else now i notice some people in other reviews saying its expensive but unless youre ordering the rib eyes or the seafood plates i dont see how anyone could consider this place pricey and if youre going to order a rib eye what do you expect i go to steakhouses a lot as well and calderos steak prices were average i came here one evening with the bf and a friend of ours my bf got the nachos which is just a mountain of food in itself i got the chicken empanadas our friend got a carne asada burrito there were sodas and a beer and including tip we spent expensive not at all noooooooo who did i piss off to cause this calamity to fall upon me closed in its place filibertos mexican food bar im so confused review coming}

{20393, Maggiano's Little Italy, 3200 Las Vegas Blvd S The Strip Las Vegas NV 89109, at maggianos the portions are huge and weve always found it is more economical to order several dishes and share rather than ordering off their family menu this location is at one end of the fashion show mall http www yelp combizrxubafqrrkvvejanurwhridoyszir xjuuvttevpg the non smoking section has a strip view the whole place feels very airy with lots of windows vegan report getting the bruschetta without cheese and the minestrone soup without cheese always makes me a happy lady the moment we got to vegas last weekend my friend insisted we go to this place i really wasnt in the mood for italian food but the group wanted it so i was out of luck after a rather long wait for a non buffet restaurant min we were seated we got the insalata caprese although they didnt call it that and the spinach and feta raviolio and manicotti and finished with the creme brulee the portions are rather large so with a guy and girls the above menu was enough the prices were very fair especially considering it was vegas and that it was considered a very good restaurant the wine selection was decent if youre not in the mood to go bankrupt at nobu lupo or postrio go to maggianos for some very reasonable and altogether excellent italian food in a great setting the food at maggianos is absolutely superb knowing that las vegas has a rep for the ultra high end maggianos was the best i had the profiterole rolls were absolutely divine and the setting a little reminiscent of pastis in new york the best italian food ive had in vegas and the best bruschetta ive ever had anywhere admittedly ive not yet actually been to italy though the menu options were original and everything we ordered was both extraordinarily flavorful and fresh we were there for lunch and the prices were a steal for example the bruschetta was the size of a meal in itself and the wine by the glass was also reasonable by vegas standards our waiter was nothing special but we wanted for nothing and while the dining experience for me is usually diminished when dining in a mall even a vegas mall i found that the location was actually quite nice and lended itself to great views of the strip i would have liked to have tried the desserts but i hardly could finish my meal because of the large portions i guess that means ill have to go back an average pf chang cheesecake factory quality chain restaurant located at the very fashionable fashion show mall for vegas this might be star but for me it is only sorry bring your appetite portions are buffet style great atmosphere great fresh food the plates have just the right amount of flavor even the heaviest dishes end up being pretty light the prices are really good and accommodate every appetite since most plates are available in full and half size we spent days in vegas and had dinner at the maggianos twice this place is sooooo yummy i went for dinner and there was a little bit of a wait but it wasnt too bad theres not much of a waiting area which sucks because it feels like youre always in the way once we were seated it was more of the same the tables were very close together and people kept squeezing by our table which truly annoyed me for that reason i had to remove one star however everything else was superb i had the lobster ravioli which was delicious in fact im making myself hungry just thinking about it i also had a caramel apple martini which was delicious i had to get another by the end of the meal my belly was full and my body was tipsy id say thats a perfect way to end the day maggianos little italy is on the second floor of the fashion show mall across from the wynn and treasure island on las vegas blvd maggianos is a chain restaurant that can be found in over states i have eaten at the one in minneapolis as well as this one i guess in the hiearchy of italian food chain restaurants it goes something like this out of the can and not italian chef boyardee slightly better casual not italian olive garden and macaroni grill a little better if you didnt know better pasta pomodoro mid level trying to fool you as high end italian maggianos and buca de beppo higher prices and more northern italian il forniao really great italian dont tend to be chain restaurants maggianos has nice ambiance expensive dark wood decor and is usually very popular and crowded in vegas expect to wait even with a reservation we had a party of called at and couldnt get reservation until maggianos is perfect for large parties as they offer huge dishes that are meant to be shared most have a half size option so take it they offer a family style approach special menu for large groups where the cost is per person and includes shared appetizers pastas and mains in a bottomless approach they encourage this as they will tell you if you order a la carte it may take minutes for pasta we went a la carte because some didnt want to comprimise into limited selections the mozzarella buffula appetizer what they called tomato slice and mozzarella or something like that is one of my favorite italian appetizers the special goat mozzarella with a basil leaf over a tomato slice is a nice combination maggianos shreds the basil which i prefer the fresh whole leaf you get slices with an order the capellini darrabiata which they call by the english name of angel hair comes in a huge bowl with about to pound of pasta roma tomatoes garlic and a little oil with some basil and a slightly spicey arrabiata sauce they have a couple of lasagna offerings either covered in a bolognese ground beef sauce or in a marinara it is huge like everything is there is a large menu of good selections for most people they dont offer olive oil and balsamic vinegar with your bread but if you ask for it they will bring it to you if you want a lot of food and willing to pay over per person for pasta go here i dined here on a monday by myself at pm it was busy but i was seated at a booth without hesitation the menu is vegetarian friendly i chose to get the half order of spaghetti with a mixture of marinara and white sauce while waiting for my entree i munched on the fresh bread that i dipped in olive oil mmmmm the spaghetti was good i would have finished it if hadnt eaten the bread my waitress was friendly attentive and efficient yeah its a chain but for the price point and compared to whats around you get not only a good deal but good food too good italian food although the hostess took forever to seat us our server was much better and the food was good we got the chopped salad which was great and the pesto chicken pine nut linguine it actually wasnt spectacular but it was much better later that night for dinner ive seen maggianos in other cities but this was my first time dining at one we decided to have our meal family style which was recommend by my brother and his fiancee the food was pretty good in particular we enjoyed the mussels and loved the tiramisu our server was excellent they also have some reasonably priced wines available ive heard mixed things about this chain but was pretty impressed with my visit family style definitely seems to be the way to go when dining here food food here was excellent i had the chicken parmigiana which also came with a side of spaghetti or fettuccine the spaghetti was delicious and the chicken was also very tasty and moist portions were huge especially for lunch time price prices are modercheap why go to an expensive italian place on the strip when you can dine here for half the price and get good quality food atmosphere i liked dining here it was quiet relaxing and great for groups or family dining service service was great our waitress was very friendly and attentive our water glasses were always refilled location located in fashion show mall on the second floor great to dine afterbefore shopping please try the bruschetta really good and you can taste the fresh garlic very good service and the food is good we went here last thursday around pm and goooooood loooooord was it a long wait for a table i was surprised this place was as packed as it was definitely make a reservation even on a thursday aside from that the food was decent the wife went for the lasagna after rave reviews from my year old coworker who said it was the best hed ever had it was ok a little too sausagey and i thought lasagna was supposed to have lasagna noodles in it i went with the calamari marinaraarrabiata or whatever which was pretty good but noras is better and less portions are huge here its nice they offer half sizes but i would still opt for the regular portions since leftovers ie nd meal is worth having you could easily just split a salad and entree with another person and be full i still prefer noras and battistas over this place but its not bad i give it im surprised this place has four stars which i think is a little high if youre judging based on taste but value for your money this is definitely good value i came here a couple nights ago with a very large group about we showed up without notice and they were still able to get a table for us in about half an hour or so the table ordered off the family style menu where you can only pick two of each course but can have as much of those courses as you want until youre ready for the next one we ordered calamari caesar salad another type of salad i think it was the maggianos tomato with mozarella chicken parmesan lasagna spaghetti with marinara sauce salmon tiramisu and cheesecake the salads were decent crisp and tangy the mozarella that came with the tomato was not very smooth and a little too pizza mozarella tasting for me the spaghetti with marinara sauce was my personal favorite along with some of the other people at the table it was light and the spaghetti was cooked to just the right tenderness the lasagna was very salty and the meat chunky in an unpleasant crumbly way it wasnt chewy cheesy and meshing with the lasagna layers the cheesecake was really delicious came with fresh strawberries and whipped cream mm the service was a little slow and sometimes unmindful of us but it was fairly busy in the restaurant so i can understand id come here for a decent large group setting with fairly cheap eats but i wouldnt come here for a date or a small intimate group meal great italian food could be a bit pricey for what you get at this restaurant i ordered the lobster ravioli which literally gives you like pieces or something and it was very good i love pasta and this place seems to cook it well the bread isnt that bad here either great service too i have been to the one in santa row in ca and i feel that the vibe there is more elegant than this one since this one is in the fashion mall bring your family here im not the biggest fan of chain places mostly because the food lacks love and atmosphere seems fake but if theres a chain place that does it right it would have to be maggianos the food feels like its been prepared with care and the place is comfortable without being too commercial and their las vegas location is no exception the maggianos salad and chocolate zuccotto cake are a must try what was particularly interesting for this visit was the wine i had i usually find it difficult to smell what im suppose to smell in red wine hints of strawberries cherries oak vanilla leather sunshine earth wind fire etc whatever not this time i smelled the floral bouquet that was suppose to be in my red i was so shocked that i was practically snorting instead of drinking it the only reason i stopped was i heard our waiter ask is everything okay sir and as i looked up from my glass to answer i saw the wife shaking her head with the what are you doing look and the waiter slightly looming behind her with a smirk i placed my glass down and responded were fine thank you i shouldve responded with this wine may have gone sour could you please bring me something else but then he would have taken the only wine i could smell properly we decided to stop here and have lunch boy am i glad that we did maggianos was delicious i really regret not taking pictures of our food but i was enjoying it so much that i was too busy stuffing my face and didnt think to pull out the camera im a total soup girl so after hearing the days selection of soups i decided on a cup of roasted mushroom soup when it arrived my jaw dropped i asked for a cup or small whatever and it arrived in a huge bowl the portions were huge i even waited and double checked with our server that they didnt make a mistake and give me the bigger size bowl of soup and she said nope thats the small one well the soup was delicious it was full of mushrooms in a cream base and was sooooo yummyyy my mom ordered the small spinach salad and that was delicious as well never had roasted red peppers in a spinach salad and it surprisingly gave great flavor with the smoked bacon crumbled gorgonzola sweet onions and toasted pine nuts we would have been just fine with our soup and salad but little did we know that the portions were going to be so huge okay entree time we both went with sandwhiches i had the jumbo lump crabcake sandwhich via their menu on the website crab cake on a brioche bun with arugula tomato and crispy onion strings and mustard mayonnaise served with parmesan chips and my mom had the seared salmon sandwhich which is not listed on the menu online for some odd reason those were the best damn sandwhiches ive ever had omgggg sooo yummyyyy i think its funny that we were at an italian restaurant and didnt have pasta but i am so glad at our choices because the food was soooo delicious we were so stuffed from our soup and salad that we each only ate half of our sandwhiches and went back to our hotel room with our leftovers happily lol we were very happy with our lunch from maggianos and will be making it a regular stop on future visits to vegas although i am in the bay and heard theres a maggianos down in san jose i rarely head down to the south bay so i doubt ill be visiting that one i highly suggest the location in las vegas p s excellent service as well oh yeah and it was a lovely day so we opted to dine outside and it was very nice the weather was perfect im not big on chain restaurants but maggianos is my fav italian spot ive never had a bad experience at the woodland hills location in ca and lv did not disappoint the food is always great and so is the service ive tried a lot of the appies and my favs are the calamari stuffed mushrooms and the shrimp oreganata awesome i love the four cheese ravioli with the pesto alfredo as rachel says yum o the maggianos chopped salad is also great this place all in all is great for groups or even a nice dinner with bf keep it up maggianos i love this place i came here with a large group and we were served family style with so many delicious entrees but this place had already won me over before the food came the restaurant has a glass wall and if you sit in the right corner you can see the fashion show mall wynn las vegas and even down the north end of the strip i loved watching the wynn sign change colors and move as i ate and enjoyed great cocktails the food was authentic italian food and vey filling delicious we had a ravioli that was too die for a lemon chicken with capers i think there was also like a lasagna or something i dont know but everything was good and just really above average the girl sitting next to me hated seafood and wouldnt try a few things so she kept complaining but seriously grow up and eat some damn fish this place is great the atmosphere is homey and a little cheesy with italian music playing the lighting was dark and the table cloths where red and white checkered i loved everything about this restaurant the food was great the wait staff was impeccable my favorite part of the meal is the hunk of parmesan cheese they give you yummy i also enjoyed the grappa they hand you at the end of the evening this maggianos like all the others is what it is but a little bit better given the excellent viewpoint from the fashion show mall out onto the strip went here with people and had wonderful time despite the mediocre food like all chains the menu is formulaic and there are hits and misses hits include the super garlicy shrimp oreganata garlic shrimp linguine and lobster ravioli needless to say they do garlic right the tiramisu was also quite tasty and enormous not that this matters much since maggianos is all you can eat misses included a mediocre actually pretty bad gnocchi oily and limp eggplant parmesan and cheesecake that was heavy and flavorless i last went t this maggianos back in and cant say id recommend it for fine dining but in terms of bang for your buck in las vegas it is certainly a valid option stars for the food for a good time atomsphere with a big group its closer to a than a but ill round up for good memories solid i have been to three maggianos in ca and now vegas the one in vegas is the best one this is my favorite place to eat italian food the food is great they have large portions service was quick and polite always try to go to a maggianos on the off hours or make a reservation to avoid long waits my favorites are the chicken parm and garlic shrimp pasta despite my previous experiences with maggianos in san jose i particularly enjoyed my maggianos experience in las vegas the bar here was just as high as my first experience back in san jose we were here for my buddys birthday and we had well over twenty people with us the staff pulled out all the stops to make sure we were well taken care of the food was like a flowing river of endless plates and our waiters did an excellent job of keeping us entertained since las vegas has been a regular stop for my friends and i as of late i would definitely come back here to re live the experience food recommendations everything stars star stars for the food i love maggianos their baked four cheese raviolis in creamy pesto sauce could not be more ah mazing buyer beware the half order is more than enough to fill you up and another fair warning the mamas lasagna could probably feed a family of five ok if you have a huge appetite maybe a family of three star for the server the service was great we were seated quickly the food came out quickly had a great table with a view of the outside of fashion show mall but our server really screwed up he asked us where we were from and we responded california and he proceeded to tell us what bad drivers we are umm does he know we are the ones who tip him regardless us this gentlemans faux pas i still tipped him hopefully hell learn to keep his big mouth shut next time he gets one of us crazy californian drivers much better experience than the santana row san jose ca location the servers staff food were excellent everyone was polite the location was much nicer and more central to the strip we had a great time we had a nice family dinner and enjoyed every aspect i usually like maggianos especially when i come with a big group the view from this location is great because its right above the strip so you can see everything around the wynn which is right across the street the host staff was polite the food was quick but our server was none of the above he basically did everything short of rolling his eyes at us what a mood killer and meal killer and maggianos killer so i pass by maggianos every time i visit southcoast in cali which is almost weekly but i had never tried their food so when we were in vegas for my birthday we decided to head their for our lunch before we headed back to cali we ordered our meal after awhile because the server was being erratic and then after twenty minutes or so we got our appetizer after we recieved it they asked us to move to another table towards the middle and we had to carry our own food and dishes over then after another twenty minutes or so we received our food too bad when we said no marinera on my besties pasta and confirmed that we are sorry but to please substitute and she glady said it was no problem it of course came out with marinera however it took so long in the first place for our food to arrive so my bestie stuck to it then what happened is unbelievable they actually started vacuuming right behind us back and forth back and forth with no warning what so ever which i dont even know if it would have made it any better after minutes yes seriously the couple behind us asked to get the check because they couldnt stand it after the whole ordeal our server comes out as if she just realized the vacuum had been on and asks if we want to move no idiot the dust already flew up and landed safely on my food i dont want to eat now i want to get out apparently they had their carpet cleaned and they needed to vacuum the moisture out as if that could not wait until another time what a dissappointment so i asked her for their card so i could leave corporate a comment i didnt get to it until a month or so later and they said it was too late to leave a comment but too bad i still did after my comment i didnt receive any notice that they received my comment i am not looking for free comps or anything of that nature i just want them to understand that is not what i expected in a restuarant it reminded me of those annoying sweepers in cafeteriasfastfood joints this location needs help theres so much to say about it this place i dont know how to start first our reservation was for we got seated at but didnt get to order till pmseriouslyan hour and a half for our server to take our order then we got our food at btw theres in our party my sis lambchops were past well done she asked for medium rare i ordered lobster fettucine w no peas and artichokes what did i getlobster fettucine with peas and artichokesmy sis got her garlic mashed potatoes after shes almost done with chewing her very chewy lambchops the rest of the food was well okay not great for what youre paying for by the end of the night our bill totaled to almost of it is gratuity for our server who we saw twice im never coming back to this place if you want italian food you might as well go to macaroni grill way much better and less expensive i love love love maggianos ive been to three of their locations and most recently the las vegas one again my bf and i arrived around on a saturday night and thankfully only waited about minutes to be seated i had been starving myself since the morning in anticipation of this meal we took the first available which was outside and i wouldnt recommend it its not maggianos fault but there was an ipod commercial running on a continuous loop on one of the outdoor televisions at the mall even with the ambient noise and the restaurants own music by the time we were done with dinner i was ready to jab a fork in both of my ears that being said i still had a great dinner ive never been disappointed with the food nor service and this time was no different our waiter was very nice and attentive and helped us pick out a really good bottle of wine we started with the fried mozzarella with marinara sauce yummm the maggiano salad has a great light flavored dressing and little bits of prosciutto in it so tasty and for the main course we shared my favorite dish on the face of this planet the chicken and spinach manicotti words just cannot do this dish justice suffice it to say its freakin fabulous i somehow mustered the courage to order desert even though my stomach was filled to the max but i just absolutely love their cheesecake i am not a big fan of cheesecake but maggianos makes theirs with mostly marscapone cheese and it is just wonderful so if you are in vegas and looking for some overly generous portioned great food i highly recommend maggianos my first time at maggianos overall and it did not disappoint had such a great window seat where you could see wynn and people busying around down below since the maggianos was in the nd floor of the building i think this particular location would be great for lunch or anytime the sun is out because the sun shines through the big open windows ordered big pasta dishes to share with four other people of course but i would be down to eat all that have to rave about the rigatonid the sauce made it what it is a pesto white creamy sauce sooo good i definitely recommend it to everybody our waiter i forget the name was awesome he had this cool accent and was so nice and helpful the calamari was ok but the cheesecake was pretty good i love maggianos it is great for big parties my family and i are a huge fan of the family style lunch http www maggianos comfoodbeveragedefault aspmenufamilystylelunch you get two choices of appetizers salads pastas entrees and desserts they also refill the plates so if you finish your appetizer theyll give you another one and if you dont finish it they let you box it up my favorites are the calamari fritte stuffed mushrooms and the tiramisu everyone in the world needs to celebrate one event in their life at maggianos it is totally worth the price went here for dinner just me and the hubby every time we come out to vegas we come here great place love the food scenery was very nice and italian of course waiters was great very little wait time if you never been there before and dont know where to park it can be tricky or you will be walking for a while before you get there hubby and i had a great romantic time been going there since every visit to vegas we always make sure we stop here this is great mouth watering italian food my fav dish is the rigatoni d we love the calamari this is another place that ive only experience for happy hour i would have given the place a if they hadnt taken the pizzas off the hh menu they were so good the other items like the crispy onions the mozarella sticks etc were still fabulous they usually have drink specials as well like deals on pink vodka martinis depending on the day there is also a piano player in the loungebar area what a let down maggianos ended up to be my first experience ended up being a horrible one come on now you do not vacuum your carpet when you have guests who are eating making us move to another table just so you can vacuum does not make it any better i think i might have ate some of the dust besides that whole ordeal the calamari was the best i ever had here the best i ordered a chicken dish which was blah kfc prepares better chicken its my fault though ordering chicken at a italian restaurant is like eating sushi at a buffet in vegas it sucks the rave reviews surprise me saltiest food ever i could barely eat the eggplant parm which is usually a favorite of mine i was thirsty for an entire day after i thought i was going to need an iv to replenish my fluids so f ing good came here for dinner with some friends we were seated right away service was great the food was yummy i had the lobster fetticine and that shit was the bomb the ambiance of the restaurant was very nice too very elegant you didnt even feel like you were in vegas best of all it was affordable and not as expensive as you would expect compared to other restaurants in vegas this is my favorite restaurant i love to eat here with my family for birthdays and such they have some of the best italian food i have ever tasted theres really good spaghetti fettuccine alfredo with broccoli my favorite with or without greens and chicken parmesan they also have this stuff called onion strings like a small classy plate of mini entangled onion rings that is cravable especially with the creamy lemonish sauce you have to ask for it on the side though or you may not get it the atmosphere is really nice too especially if youre in the room surrounded by windows unless someone suicidal brought a pet rock as their date they give you a dessert on your birthday they used to be lemon cookies but i think they changed it to cake i dont particularly like the desserts but my family loves those lemon cookies overall this is one of the best italian places period tony b i just want to set the record straight maggianos is owned by a private company that was started in which also owns on the border macaroni grill and chilis maggianos restaurant has had the same owner since there has been no ownership change if you had a bad experience maggianos thrives on customer satisfaction and will make sure that your next experience is a happy and memorable one thanks and dont forget to mention this article and mention the banquet sales department when you return stephany las vegas service stars attentive cordial tapped out our drinks made sure we were fine and dandy like a jovial dean martin singing that mambo italiano song oh wait this song was played during our meal on im sure it loops every day though decor stars fancier than macaroni grill and i should hope so as this is vegas and a step above its sister restaurant the seating was vast and it could probably fit at least bachelorette parties oh yeaaahh bachelorette parties droool there werent too many people let alone bachelorette parties but most patrons were enjoying the beautiful weather in their outdoor seating area food stars the minestrone was ok it was a bit cheesy and the color seemed paler not as tomato red and its taste was different than most minestrone soups ive had i had the lobster fettuccine there wasnt much lobster italian sausages were also few and a bit burnt the peas and artichokes gave it a nice balance the white wine cream sauce was really good but a little salty than i like my pasta sauces to be so this little italy favorite is a mainstay in san francisco fare im glad i had the chance to savor it in vegas id come back id probably go someplace closer though like orange county and go all out family style p s to the previous yelpers i agree that the food made me thirsty however this place isnt as salty as their cousin on the border in rancho cucamonga p p s update i just read an article in yahoo health today http health yahoo comexpertseatthisamericas unhealthiest restaurants chilis on the border and macaroni grill all owned by maggianos parent company brinker are on the hit list and the sodium count on their menu items arent benefiting my pre hypertension i decided to have takeout since there was an hour wait even on a tuesday night the service was fast as i got my food in minutes i shared a clam pasta dish and a beef dish for the pasta dish it was bland because they forgot the sauce that was supposed to come with it it was too late to bring it back since i was already at my hotel room when i found out oh well as for the meat dish it was really good it was extremely moist and melts in your mouth i would definitely order that again i think i would have to try this place again to give it a fair review i have been here twice in the last year and both times were amazing i went with my wife both times and we requested a table with a view and when we got there we sat right in the corner and we were able to see all the people walking the strip and the cool wynn sign the place is huge so it is a great place for large parties as well if you dont want to take a lot of food home or back to the hotel room then just order the orders instead and even though it still may be tons of food at least you wont be wasting it all the drinks are wonderful and the food is great every time we come here sure its just like any other maggianos as far as taste goes but its vegas so there is a little added something i talk to the gm of this restaurant like once a month and he is a really nice guy the staff is great and the views are amazing if you have not been here go and if you have been here go back peace out mz i was there for my birthday and a couple of us had our birthdays on the same day or weekend so we thought itd be cool have our b day dinner there the food was good i forgot what i had no i wasnt drunk wait was i but i know it was good and they give good hearty portions the negatives were how crammed up the dining area is i mean if youre claustrophobic then this aint the place for you you can damn near eat off the next table if youre slick enough the other issue i had was the serenading musicians now they probably didnt mean any harm but after coming to our table one of them noticed we were all black and said i dont know any rap but i take requests wow did he really just go there i had to put him in check and told him to keep it movin before i show him what gangsta rap looks like when a violin becomes a weapon needless to say he quickly got out of there then they misplaced the birthday cake but later found it then lost the top that goes over it then later found it yeah it was one of those nights but the food was good maybe a tad bit overrated for the price though especially in a food ladened city like vegas visiting maggianos was one of the best experiences i had in vegas we found it on yelp from the glowing reviews and they pretty much all held true the service was friendly the food was enormous and subtle in flavor we vacuumed up everything the wine was fine and they served us hot bread rolls with olive oil and balsamic vinegar before our appetizers all in all a way classy italian place for extremely cheap i couldnt believe i had such a delicious meal in an elegant environment and wine for only highly recommended it hasnt been scientifically proven but maggianos may be the leading contributor to obesity in the united states good lord this place serves a ton of food it was odd that i asked the waiter how big the baked zitti was off the lunch menu he did his best to talk me out of it by saying that it was small and not that big a half portion as he put it this thing was huge full of fresh sausage heavy sauce and noodles that could have fed three people instead of just one we ended up getting our meal comped by the manager after a mix up with the bill which was great and ill definitely return when im in town again great view too if you get a table near the glass ive only been here once and man i dont know how i never been here before its a very nicely decorated restaurant that feels pretty fancy but it actually isnt that expensive we had a large group that got the family style dinner it was fantastic everything was delicious and we were able to take home boxes of left overs it was like a buffet that was brought over to you large portions so youll definitely get your moneys worth bring your eatin pants wow strangely i live fairly close to a maggianos and yet it took a trip to vegas for me to try it out what the heck took me so long this place is so yummy our large group decided to get family style dinner salads were great pastas were amazing we got a salmon dish that was so good there was a roasted chicken which was slightly dry but that was the worst of it service was great and our waitress was right on top of everything we even got to take home the leftovers mmmm quality ingredients good food chicken francese is the bomb also sausage peppers appetizer was really good cool location is directly across from wynn a great place to visit if you are sick of the hotel buffets the atmosphere was nice and cozy we came in on a saturday night and our option was to wait minutes or sit at the bar for dinner we sat at the bar the food was great huge portions we figured out after the fact that they specialize in family portions i ordered the half order of lobster ravioli and it was delicious five huge raviolis stuffed with big chunks of lobster and a great sauce the portion of sauce was just right it was not drowning in it my friend ordered the caesar salad and when they brought it out we actually started laughing because it was so huge he managed to eat the whole thing though as for drinks i had the watermelon martini and he had the classic martini both were great i would definitely visit again the pasta for the price at maggianos just cant be beat i went with my mom and her sister and my bf chris l last week while in vegas i shared the gnocchi and meat lasagna with chris l and my mom and aunt shared the corn pasta with shrimp the corn pasta was a must for them because they are both on a gluten free diet so regular wheat pasta just doesnt cut it i love that a serious italian restaurant cares about the wheat free side of life and offers wheat free options i also love that a serious italian restaurant can taste this good and not break the bank the wine list is great and the desserts were pretty good i got the profiterole with ice cream and chocolate sauce and the dessert wouldve been divine if it werent for the profiterole the two baby boomers at the table each got the gf creme brulee and loved it so for what maggianos is im giving it stars it certainly beats the other cheap food of vegas and the price is so much better than the expensive restaurants there thats a win win in my book very nice restaurant i was trying to stay away from buffets and this place was conveniently located across the street from our hotel the host and waitress not so nice but the food made up for it i had to change the time of the reservation time once because we were running late and i guess she didnt like that the waitress took our order and forgot about us for a while the food was really good it had a really good taste it comes in really big portions so you can share or just take the rest home prices are reasonable off to maggianos with a party of thirteen a very comfortable setting so it seem just a little bit too dim which makes a perfect place for a date for her and him but an even more perfect for a family dinner as we waited to be seated we got hungrier and hungrier we were then told that with parties bigger than eight we must do family style even if we each want our own plate we talked to the waiter who spoke with the manager because of misunderstanding our own dish we were able to order we had vegetarians in our party so the chef actually came and took their orders personally i ordered the clam pasta with red sauce it was a big portion even when it is a half course so i split my meal with a friend the dish was so delicious we finished til the very end our glasses of water were never empty for the waiter always refills it every minute oh so gracefully the accordion player in the restaurant was very sweet and nice a friend spoke with him for a bit and he played her a song without thinking twice we were also celebrating our friends birthday another song he played for her and must i say it was very very lovely a great environment for a birthday party the price was decent for the big portion of meal i have to say it is a very good deal i had never been here but we were doing a combo bachelorettebirthday and this place was awesome one waitress was pissed because we were taking a lot of pictures and standing in her way oooohhhh im scared she kept giving us mean looks but whatevs getting a group of females together to decided on entrees salads apps is like filing your nails down a chalkboard someone has to take control i ordered a reisling and sat back to watch the fireworks show with large parties the restaurant strongly suggests ok forces you to have family style which is fine by me it actually works to your advantage because then you arent squabling over the damn check of course we had one in our party that was a squabbler and a little bit of a pouty puss and was mad when she didnt get her own way well okayyyyyy so we finally decided on the chopped salad and spiniach salad and the bride is jewish so we asked for baconpork on the side which was no problem the brushetti was awesome the bread great and the spinach dip was ok kinda like the frozen kind just ok the ravioli was great the waiter even brought me and another girl a sample large sample of the pesto with chicken and it was my fav we both wanted to order it for the entree but because of the family style we couldnt two people wanted to order off the ala carte menu which they said was fine as long as at least wanted family style that built in gratuity is a blessing because at the end of the meal which was per person i ended up putting in which covered my dinner wine tax and tip couldnt beat it with a stick the food is times better than stinky old buca di pepto bismal i highly recommend this place and im a picky eater love it i was craving pasta for dinner after the crap i ate at todd englishs olives so we wandered over from the wynn and found this place stuffed mushrooms were amazing the spinach salad was really good and the lobster ravioli was good it had big chunks of lobster in it but the cream sauce could have been better still yummy though my wife and i come to las vegas twice or three times a year and always grab a cocktail or two at maggianos i am really glad to see that the owner realized to re implement the best happy hour on the las vegas strip for some reason they decided to stop this in may but given the state of the economy this was the best thing maggianos could do i will always continue to come here and recommend it to my friends keep doing what you are doing calamari bomb stuffed mushrooms bomb veal parmesan solid lasagna pretty interesting taste has an italian sausage kick to it waiter was cool and made good suggestions as well this place is located upstairs in the front outside part of the fashion show mall on the strip if your driving park on the north side of the mall in the underground parking this place was packed with people yet we still got seated very quickly the waiter was very pleasant and helpful we ordered a linguine with white clam sauce very good the bracciola ok maggianos salad yummy and chicken marsala good but i prefer cheesecake factorys i know i know dont yell at me the prices were very reasonable and the complimentary bread was oh so yummy with the olive oil and vinegar great food and great service what more do you want i was pleasantly surprised by a trip to maggianos a little over a month ago during a visit to las vegas i normally avoid chains but this one is worth visiting again the appetizers were all very good we went during happy hour the main courses were huge and moderately priced the service was very fast without bring rushed and our waitress was friendly the location is convenient on the front of the fashion show mall easy access from the wynn which is where i was staying plenty of on site parking as the mall has every parking option under the sun we sat outside view was very nice food portions are huge a half order is enough for one person a full order is for people who want to share i ordered a special chianti beef it was a little salty for my taste but my brother said it was great i tasted some of his garlic shrimp linguine which was good but the noodles lacked flavor i also tasted some of my moms shrimp angel hair pasta which was the best in my opinion it was full of flavor but not too much my family did critcize that the noodles were a little overcooked though but i found it perfect i guess it depends on your preference and how you like your noodles now i saved the best for last i would honestly go to maggianos just for their garlic mashed potatoes i have ever only really tasted two chefs mashed potatoes that i liked previous to this dish but this is definitely in my top its hard to describe but you just have to taste it its the perfect blend of ingredients not too salty good consistency just try it id seriously go all the way to san jose from sf just to eat the mashed potatoes food took a little long to be prepared service was pretty good our waters got refilled but nothing extremely special or eyecatching heard this location is under new management and is experiencing some issues my last visit was last october so this review will be based on that experience maggianos is one of my absolute favorite restaurants why because its great food healthy portions and outstanding value for what you get i always leave satisfied and the service has always been wonderful visited the santa ana ca chevy chase md and tysons corner va locations all the bomb my favorites rigatoni d chicken parmesan i order this with a side of pasta and meat sauce since the chicken parm does not come with it apple crostada peach bellini now you know i have to have a cocktail with dinner ive also sampled the spaghetti which is also pretty good honestly ive had better though maggianos is one of the last locations on the strip that offers a classy upscale atmosphere without the pretentiousness and is extremely affordable and family friendly i highly recommend maggianos for the money you cant go wrong the food is fresh and tastes like italian food no fusion nonsense here all dishes hot and tasty service good a popular spot for locals and tourists you cant go wrong for chain italian after a long day and nite of work headed to maggianos for a late nite supper small side salad good spaghetti w marinara good portions huge waiter was really nice too even though we came late and stayed late there is no other italian place in my opinion in las vegas i have been coming here for years every time i come to vegas the only way to do it is family style you get so much food and they take such good care of you the only problem i have is i eat to much every time i go and the rest of the night is miserable i never learn hahah ate here last night and really enjoyed the food i tried the crab cakes which i really enjoyed even though im not a big fan of seafood i had the chicken and spinach stuffed manicotti and loved it the bathrooms were pretty dirty but it was late at night when we went the service was good and we had a really good time there some places wow you with their style and exotic cuisine others sneak up on you with a little more subtlety maggianos was one of my favorite meals in las vegas because they just made everything easy first of all being in a non smoking restaurant was literally a breath of fresh air we got to curl up in a cozy booth facing floor to ceiling windows so it was an entirely different vibe from most casino restaurants it is a chain but it meant they offered a wide variety of reasonably priced options and our lunch entrees chicken pesto linguine and chicken francese were excellent one of my favorite things to eat in italy is a fresh arugula salad lightly tossed with oil but it is hard to find in the u s i was thrilled when it came as a side to the chicken francese and it brought back so many wonderful memories from our arrival through the end of service the staff was professional prompt and courteous portion size was hearty especially the pasta dish so we even skipped dinner that night not the most exciting choice in town but sometimes you just want a little comfort food and air sweet sweet fresh air for my mother in laws birthday last weekend my husband planned a big surprise birthday party for her at maggianos which is an old favorite haunt of his maggianos exterior is nothing spectacular considering theyre stuck on the second floor of a mall but once you step out of the elevator youre transported giant crystal chandeliers line the majestic hallways as you pass through the entryway and multiple private dining areas lined with dark wood the bar area is dark paneled well staffed and tucked far in the busy back main dining room it was packed when we arrived but we found seats and ordered cocktails quite easily though we heard there was a one hour wait for tables for those without reservations when our table for was ready we headed over to a corner lot where our group gathered it wasnt particularly easy to navigate the space in which theyd placed our party as theyve crammed as many tables in the room as they can and we were situated up against six booths however the waiters were quite patient practicing a constant ballet battle with us while we hugged one another and took photographs or they just went around the other way the ambiance inside maggianos was so dark warm and cozy that i was expecting more from the food the calamari that someone ordered as an appetizer was boring bland and uninspired the spinach salad i ordered was giant and tasty however i wished id stopped there unfortunately my huge vat of gnocci was equally bland and mediocre and the bread on the tables was stalehard it was so loud and busy in the restaurant and i was drunk which ill get to in a minute that i didnt even think to ask to try gts entree linguini and clams in red sauce which he said was a good thing because he hated it and said that the food was much better a few years ago the adorable accordian player was a wonderful touch he played some of our requests at one end of the table although it was so loud in the restaurant that those on the other end couldnt hear throughout our meal i was shocked that i wasnt drinking my wine every time i turned to look at my glass i could swear it looked as if i hadnt touched it turns out that the stealth waiters were just constantly topping it off which unfortunately resulted in a disequilibrium in the brain of yours truly and my evening ended with me trying to get my mother in law to take us to a strip club and arguing with gts uncle whod flown in from oahu for the occasion about whether or not boys are hornier than girls bad self bad perhaps a waiter asking a gal every now and again if shed like more wine would help a hypothetically drunk girl manage her evening in a slightly more classy manner my main gripe however was that gt and i had made cupcakes for dessert that spelled out oh shit shes when all lined up properly but we brought them in our cupcake pan and the waiter brought them out in the same pan wed brought them in though wed asked that they be put on a large plate as a result they read ohsh itsh es also although the kindpatient waiter did light the candles for us i got the impression that the staff just wrote us off at the end or perhaps someone in the back was a little ticked off with us for bringing our own dessert regardless of the reason i thought it very odd that they didnt bring us plates or forks with dessert we had to hunch over the table and eat cupcakes over the tiny cupcake wrappers carefully trying not to spill crumbs everywhere which is not so easy to do when youre drunk on maggionos bottomless glass of wine ate here for my last meal during my las vegas trip and i am pleased to report that it was a great decision my mom sister and i walked on over here from the wynn and after a few hours of shopping we were pretty stoked to eat the salad was a bit heavy on the dressing but my lasagna was a delicious monster of a thing that went straight into my belly also they give free bread nothing beats free bread have been for lunch and dinner and have not been disappointed looking forward to more visits they make my favorite pasta dish spaghetti with red clam sauce here and it certainly did not let me down so much flavor the bread served when you sit down is fresh and delicious and was made even better with the oil and vinegar blend served alongside the italian way no butter necessary service was excellent and the food was hot and fresh atmosphere and music were just what you would expect from a fine italian restaurant no complaints here honestly why have i not found this chain sooner maggianos was my favorite place of my vegas trip i must admit it was slightly biased i was part of an organization and the organization catered the food so i had literally had a ton of food nonetheless it was the best way to try the food first the appetizers came out after having the appetizers i was pretty set on making that my lunch there was bruschetta tomato caprese two types of salad but my favorite was the stuffed mushrooms oh man so good i was trying to be all professional at this lunch but all i really wanted to do was to just take the plate of mushrooms and eat off the plate it was so juicy and flavorful next came the actual entrees after filling up on the mushrooms and good salads i was about stuffed already the entrees were all really good as well there was the four cheese ravioli mmm def was one of my faves herb chicken pork medallions also one of my faves some pasta vodka dish and some great tasting beef it was all really really good what really topped the meal off well any meal for all im concerned about was the desserts first these gigantic profiteroles came out made out of huge biscuits and lots of ice cream but my favorite of all time came out the tiramisu as tiramisu is my all time favorite dessert i had high expectations of this dessert and it was met it was the right amount of lightness and the cheese was just right i was in heaven our waiter was great as well explaining every item he brought out and was prompt on filling our drinks he even answered nicely to all my curious questions of so what exactly is that what is it cooked in etc perhaps my view was slightly biased as i did not even have to pay for this lunch but all i know is the food was great and i would love to find a maggianos close to me mmm in vegas for marathon and looking for the required pre race pasta dinner didnt think to check for reservations earlier and most places are booked went back to an old favorite and they had reservations available i had the spaghetti with meat sauce and sausage huge portions nothing spectacular but very tasty and filling husband had seafood pasta cant recall name which he really liked we closed with the cheesecake mmmm one star for great prices the second star for great food we started out with bread which i thought was very fresh the calamari appetizer that we ordered came out fairly fast and was really good the four cheese ravioli was fairly good and i am very picky when it comes to eating ravioli it could have been better with more sauce the third star is for the price which isnt bad the fourth star goes to the atmosphere which i thought was very clean and well decorated minus one star for the long wait for the table and not enough waiters not the stars because it could be a bit less expensive a bit at least but the food omg the food have the lobstercrabetc fettucinni it was soooooooooo good the portions huge really huge i hope i could eat there again tonight ive only been here once and it was delicious i was staying in vegas and got tired of eating at the casinos so my friend and i drove around looking for a place to eat when we saw a sign for maggianos he had been to one in la before so we gave this one a try we were seated right away and being the klutz that i normally am i spilled my water all over the table our waiter was super nice and friendly and joked around about it aka he teased me he brought us bread right away and when i spilled water on that he brought us another basket without us having to ask i ordered the garlic shrimp linguine and my friend ordered the braised beef canneloni we both loved our meals but i think i filled up on bread so i couldnt finish we didnt have room in tiny mini fridge in our hotel room so we didnt take home any leftovers our waiter seemed almost hurt by our almost full plates of food i usually dont like creamy sauces but my pasta was very delicious and flavorful and the shrimp was cooked perfectly i find that with pasta the shrimp is often overcooked the decor was excellent and everything looked very clean i didnt expect much from a restaurant on the second floor of a mall but it was amazing i will definitely try and come back here this place was pretty impressive the gf and i received a gift card as a gift so we decided to go check it out a couple weeks ago it was packed as we went on a friday night but after the experience you can see why it was so busy great food great drink menu and the best service ive ever received our waiter m im not sure if its polite to mention names even if he was awesome is probably the best waiter in las vegas polite charming and honest so many times waiters are told to say everything is the best when asked about dishes and wines that were not his favorite he would say that they were fine but he would really recommend dish x or wine y it helped a lot that his recommendations were spot on and he wasnt just trying to pad the final bill a lot of his recommendations were cheaper than what we had first asked about as mentioned even though this place had a packed house none of the waiters or waitresses seemed rushed or hurried the food was cooked perfectly the view was amazing and the experience was perfect the gf puts this in her top three favorite restaurants category to directly quote her i love it i cant believe that this place is a chain the set up is so nice dark hardwood dim lights beautiful glassware it seems so against the whole heres what corporate sent in a box lets go throw this crap on the wall easily a new favorite if you happen to get a male waiter whose name starts with the letter m be prepared you might just get the best waiter in vegas average of stars why we were sat down by some fat little waiter who looked pissed off that he had to work for a living sorry dude but you suck he placed oil and balsamic into a dish but seemed to give tables out of the seven around him bread thank god he didnt do the feeding of the of them would have died of starvation i ordered one of the specials chicken and mushroom lasagne my experience of a lasagne is that it should be roasting hot straight out of the oven with the cheese bubbling proper italian food this was slightly warm at best and definately cooked previously frozen and reheated in a microwave poor so in all food crap and service even crapper my husband and i love to take the family to maggianos when were in las vegas the food is amazing but be sure to bring your appetite its family style so its obviously huge but the portions here seem to be exceptionally large even for family style the stuffed mushroom appetizer the caesar salads and the linguineclams in red sauce are my recommendations the service at this restaurant is amazing as well my drink was never empty they timed each course perfectly so that i was never with too little or too much food at my table and my leftovers were whisked away and returned in cute little brown packages before i had time to even notice they were gone great experience the restaurant is also on a great part of the strip so you can walk off all the food you just ate while taking in the sights we went at around pm on a weeknight there was a minute wait for a table for but there was no wait for the tables at the bar so we opted for this service was excellent the portions were very large for the price the full size pastas came in casserole dishes and about deep everyone at the table was satisfied with their dishes fettuccine alfredo baked ziti and sausage some type of seafood pasta it was on the little italy favorites menu i ordered the eggplant parmesan which i wasnt too fond of i found it to be too breaded and mushy not what im used to otherwise great atmosphere great prices there was even a wedding party at the table next to ours i know this place is a chain restaurant but that doesnt stop it from having delicious food as you would expect from any decent italian place the prices are a little high and being right in the fashion show mall doesnt help overall the food is great and the atmosphere is what you expect for what your paying now for my favorite part about this place they have something called a family style dinner to order this you are required a party of the cost is about per person and completely worth it this includes the following two appetizers two salads two pastas two entrees and a desert now you might be thinking wow thats a rip off but wait there is more to this then meets the eye all the items have to be selected off the pre build family menu but the portions are unlimited for instance if you order appetizers and you greatly enjoy them tell the server and he will bring you another order of them same goes with the salad pasta and everything else the kicker here is that you also get to take home your leftovers i would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys italian food my personal favorite dish is the following four cheese ravioli ravioli stuffed with ricotta cheese cream cheese mozzarella and provolone filling sprinkled with house cheese then browned in the oven and served in pesto alfredo cream sauce with a touch of marinara it is amazing it also always puts a smile on my face after a long hard day of shopping i wandered upstairs to a restaurant called maggianos i am so happy i did the restaurant itself sounded familiar but i knew i had never dined there before our server daniel was very attentive and personable it was my first visit to las vegas so he pointed out many things that we could do in our spare time this restaurant had a great view you could see las vegas blvd people shopping or other diners just like me everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their experience at maggianos and we were definitely enjoying ourselves we started our dining experience with the bruschetta it was definitely some of the best bruschetta i have ever had i make a pretty killer bruschetta and i was extremely impressed with shredded chunks of parmesan covering the top of the bruschetta splendido the bruschetta was served on italian garlic bread that was topped with a tomato bruschetta relish made of tomatoes balsamic vinegar and roasted garlic we also ordered the chopped salad the tuscan sausage orzo soup and the fettuccine alfredo the chopped salad was very good i ordered it without green onions the salad ingredients were iceberg lettuce tomatoes blue cheese avocado and prosciutto tossed in a house dressing most of the items on the menu they give you the option to order half or the full portion believe me when i say half is plenty when you want to eat more than just one thing i ordered the whole chopped salad and it was really big the tuscan sausage orzo soup contained italian sausage fennel white beans and tomatoes it was really tasty the fettuccine alfredo was delicious it was prepared with broccoli and garlic in a creamy alfredo sauce we only ordered the half portion of that as well and it was really large overall my experience at maggianos was great from start to finish our waters were never left empty and our server was always around if we needed anything it seemed like all the servers we saw there were on top of their game waiting tables because you never saw a table that needed anything that they couldnt ask the server for if you around the fashion show mall and you spot maggianos on the nd floor you should definitely wander up there and grab a bite to eat because i assure you it will be worth it i will definitely wander back into a maggianos even if its not in las vegas cheers and enjoy loved it i was very pleased with dinner and my time here at maggianos i had about a minute wait for a table which was no big deal once seated i was greeted by an amazing server a kind italian man who was very efficient this place was extremely clean with a wonderful atmosphere this may be a chain but i didnt know that until reading reviews before i posted my own they do not come off as a chain restaurant to me now compare them to olive garden not really anything to compare maggianos takes it hands down the food was rich and tasty salad was decent size with an amazing dressing that had a touch of spiciness i ordered a few glasses of wine and the bill came to around definitely worth the money i will be back for sure we took the kids to vegas for spring break last week yeah i know why the hell would anyone want to go to vegas with minors ask my wife anyway we needed to find a place with food that was better than mcdonalds for the adults and would appeal to our kids and not bankrupt us i had the nifty yelp app on my new handy dandy crackberry and it pointed us to maggianos the app provided many positive yelp reviews of dubious value as usual a web address and phone number enabling me to call and make a reservation and a map feature that helped us find the place with ease we were seated promptly upon arrival and the waiter was very kind to my wife and i in spite of the antics of my three little darlings it can be a royal pain to take care of families at a nice restaurant with tablecloths and wine glasses but the service was very good the have a full kids menu from which our children were able to choose something they liked my wife had some chicken pesto pasta dish which was tasty and i ordered chicken francesca which was supposedly inspired by the italian cuisine from st louis having become intimately familiar with st louis italian cuisine over the years i think that was a reach but nonetheless my dinner was very good especially for a chain the price was very reasonable and i would love to dine here again but im not planning to go to vegas again in the near future and unfortunately the closest franchise is in orange county perhaps theyll open a san diego location some day excellent italian dining in vegas they have some great pasta and chicken dishes and a decent selection of wines but an ok selection of desserts we went here about years ago and wanted a nice dinner after watching ka and it was a nice walk to get there and we only waited about mins we got seats near the window with a wonderful view of the vegas strip if youre gonna compare chain italian restaurants maggianos little italy is much better than olive garden i recommend going here to finish off a nice romantic night in vegas we went here for a business lunch the atmosphere was really nice and bright and felt very appropriate for a power lunch prices were pretty reasonable hot bread highlight of the meal chopped salad the crispy pancetta was bacon bits ick otherwise not a bad salad for my entree i got the roasted chicken with crispy potatoes and green beans everything on the plate was soggy tasteless and gross i realize one shouldnt order roasted chicken at an italian place hence why this place gets stars instead of overall not a bad place to dine on the strip but with so many fabulous options in vegas its hard for me to endorse this place boring and corporate come to mind for italian i prefer noras place nice spacious great place for a meal they have private rooms in the back clean and bright they have outside seating menu the lunch specials are not bad the dinner menu was pretty big i saw the portions for dinner and they were huge we ordered the stuff mushrooms as an appetizer and they came to our table in minutes a little too fast if you ask me i hope they were not sitting under a heat lamp fettuccine in lobster sauce was pretty good chicken picatte fed two people just fine the creamy chicken and potato soup was awesome next time i will order a bowl service the service was good our waiter however wouldnt shut up dont you hate it when they keep trying to talk to you and just go a bit too overboard and waaay too personal with the conversation it was comment after comment i could not really enjoy the time with my friends at first i felt bad but then i realized that he was borderline flirting with my girl friends especially in the end when my friend was trying to get out the booth and he extended his hand an exclaimed need some help miss my friend politely said no thank you while i was thinking in my head what a pervert to be honest he probably gets off by touching women any chance he gets minus one star for the server that wouldnt shut up it seems like we end up eating here every time we come to vegas this time was a little different because we brought out year old son i tried to be respectful of the other people eating so when i made the reservation i requested a table in a far corner of the restaurant we get there and get seated and they put us at the table in the main dining area in the corner right next to the window that overlooks wynn we have eaten at this exact same table before but not with a baby anyway we decided to stay and have a wonderful meal the waitress was very helpful with my son from making sure he had a cup with a lid to bringing us extra straws for him to chew on the food was great like every other time we went i had some type of pasta with lobster all up in it damn it was good i savored every bite everyone else in our party loved the food as well even when my son screamed a little it didnt seem to bother anyone else sitting around us that may have been because we were there for reservations at pm and we were there for an hour and a half or so so many of the dinner people probably would not have started getting there for another hour or so great time again maggianos i have a feeling we will be back next time this place is awesome i never miss a chance to dine there every time i am in vegas our last dinner there was for new years eve i had never ordered family style be ready for pregnancy pants they serve an incredible amount of food great food the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested ordering family is style is great when youre a large party or more the choice is limitless for fewer people i would recommend a la carte my very favorite dish is the braised beef cannelloni the beef and sauce are divine its better ordered a la carte than family style as it comes piping hot from the oven rather than on a large plate for everyone to share their spinach salad and maggiano steak salad are both great dont miss the lasagna too and the apple crostada so buttery maggiano please open another location in the bay area closer to sf or in the east bay san jose is too far what about walnut creek when people can eat dinner with drinks for a head on the strip youve got yourself a great deal food is above average not quite authentic but way above olive garden service was great and they were able to seat our party at for ppl without a reservation be warned you will be stuffed this restaurant has a very classy bar area clean bathrooms wonderful patio and helpful staff we were waited on by a young guy named robert who attended to my friend and i wonderfully i havent had service this courteous and prompt in years my friend had the san francisco lobster linguine but replaced the linguine with wheat penne it was so tasty i had the chicago style pasta it was bland and uneventful i even told our waiter but what can they do the bread we ate while we waited was fresh and tasty the real value to this place is the italian dining like experience on the strip without the large price tag i believe there were many lunch offerings for dollars and there are a bunch of patio tables to take in the fresh air it was all but empty inside but this might be a classy dining experience for couples during the evening this place would be a b for me the food is great not excellent but worth the price you pay for the best aspect of this restaurant is the beautiful ambiance and the big portions although i love olive garden maggianos is much more authentic italian food my usual entrees here are the lasagna the rigatoni d and the calamari yum some of their entrees are good but ive realized that most the white based sauces could taste a little bland along with other pastas but maybe it just comes down to preference also while youre there take advantage of their delicious bread we had like rounds when we were there and they provide this dip that has olive oil and balsamic vinegar not sure but regardless if you want to eat good italian food with a nice view of the strip you should consider going to maggianos great for big groups families and dates yum yum yum pretty much sums up my maggianos experience i went for a wedding reception which allowed me to sample many appetizers and entrees i was not disappointed in any of them the highlights were the breaded zucchini which was so crunchy and flavorful there was a spinach salad that tasted like a party in my mouth with bits of creamy cheese and pancetta bits the entrees were equally gratifying my faves were the salmon on a bed of spinach cooked to absolute perfection and the raviolis in a pesto cream sauce the chicken parmesan was also a front runner the chicken breasts were pounded so thin yet still juicy and moist i will definitely venture back to this gem in the mall all the food here is just really unremarkable based on my visit nothing special everything seems just unoriginal and aimed at middle of the road palates not creating anything exceptional or memorable the bartender was rude and if i wasnt with my family i would have thrown my drink in his face actually i wanted to do a lot more but i figured a true review would hurt them most dont go gotta love these guys they have good prices great food huge portions and wonderful service if you are local park valet at the north valet and you will have a elevator that will bring you straight up the a beautiful hallway leading directly to the restaurant must try i love this place the enviroment decor and food gnocchi in tomato vodka sauce and chicken pesto are my favorite clam with linguine was just a mediocre its a place i would go once or twice a month came to vegas and had dinner here there was no wait the waiter had a sense of humor and always asked twice if we needed anything and if we were sure i love love love maggianos their pastas are to die for espeically the rigatoni d and chicken pesto linguine the entire restaurant was a bit dark but it sure did make dinner feel relaxing i would recommend dressing business casual as this is on the strip and to bring an appetite as well yummmm the breakdown food a atmosphere a service a i love the maggianos in my home town so i thought why not in vegas its right across from my hotel and i know the food is awesome everything was great until we walked back to our hotel and took a nap we all woke up feeling super sick but lemme talk about the actual experience in the restaurant it was a super long wait for pm but we got hooked up and passed the line we were seated and everything was brought in a timely manner the food was the same as always and it wasnt better or worse than any other maggianos ive been to except for the part where we all got sick oh well went to maggianos on sunday night for surprise engagement dinner we were a group of and only had to wait around minutes we were able to share a bottle of prosecco at the bar during the wait we were told our table was ready and they led us into the wine cellar i was so excited to be in a private room with dimmed lighting from dinner we ordered the classic family style and were given the choices of two appetizers salads pastas entrees and desserts the food doesnt stop the only hard part was agreeing on what to order appetizers calamari fritte and bruschetta salads ceasar and chopped pastas moms lasagna and chicken truffle tortellacci entrees chicken saltimbocca and eggplant parmesan desserts creme brulee and chocolate zuccotto cake my favorites were the chopped salad love blue cheese chicken truffle tortellacci was the most interesting flavors and the eggplant parmesan had the perfect breaded textured and eggplant was cooked just right creme brulee was fantastic and huge but by that point we were so full i would also recommend the chianti castello di querceto went really well with the moms lasagna ryan was our server and he was fantastic very attentive and helpful they even brought in two older men who played guitar and violin and had us do our first dance the night was great thank you maggianos and ryan my buddies and i decided to eat here while all of us suffered from hangovers the delicious food here will restore your apetite from whatever came back out from the previous night the family style is a great way to enjoy the meal they provide a lot of food for their prices we started with the potato soup which relly jump started my apetite its rich creamy and flavorful next up was the beef braciole this dish was quite interesting the texture was weird yet it was edible may have been my hangover dulling my senses i cant quite remember the name of the next dish but it was a spicy spaghetti and meat balls i believe the spiciness brought back all my senses and pretty much kicked me out of my intoxicated state you can never go wrong with spaghetti and meatballs we also had the rigatoni d the chicken was tender and the protein gave me energy for more partying they gave us enough food to take back to the hotel and have for dinner if you love italian food and pastas this place would be a place to stop by two stars for the low quality of food my friends and i decided to spend our last dinner in vegas at maggianos it was a short walk from our hotel and we wanted some real food after nights of bingeing on whatever we can get our hands on after the clubs it is definitely on the expensive side where a half order of pasta will be around bucks while a full order will cost you they do encourage family style for tables of but i think the cheapest family style was still around a person out of the four of us we ordered spaggetti with meatballs lobster alfredo fettucini alfredo and linguine with clams all of the dishes were tasteless i had to drown my linguine with claims with half the bottle of salt and all my friends did too maybe the chef forgot about the salt idk although the pasta were tasteless the seafood was fresh and the bread was pretty good too meh ive experienced better is the perfect description for this place im a huge fan and love everything about maggianos decided to take the family as part of our vegas birthday weekend getaway it was my sons st and wanted to make it special probably a little much for my kids young adults they are of the vegas buffet breed but they agreed to check it out had a reservation and asked for the best table in the house overlooking the vegas strip dinner was in typical maggiano style hot full of flavor huge in serving size just perfect i would say the only down side was service granted the place was full and the it was a vegas friday night had to ask for water drinks rolls the basics the server was not on his game at all shame normaly the staff goes above and beyond still we had a great dinner and i will be going back to my own local maggianos woodland hills hopefully soon great food and great service perfect for groups with their family style plates deep fried zucchini is a must i made a reservation on open table and parking was really close and easy we were seated right away and were blown away by the family style option two appetizers two salads two pastas two entrees and two desserts all of it is unlimited refills really awesome food good wine nice atmosphere exceptional service i will dream about this meal great ziti and sausage service was iffy we dd the light family buffet which included appetizers salad pasta choices and lemon cookies we ordered the calamari with warm mainara sauce and stuffed mushrooms for the salad we ordered the cesar and chopped bacon pieces nano bits of avocado tomato and greens as for the pastas we ordered chicken linguini and another one which i forgot initially the purpose of doing the family style buffet was to get the unlimited refills but our waiter was quite stingy with it hmm overall verdict after going on a strict heavy pasta diet i wasnt really a big fan of this heavy strict pasta meal maybe one day ill give it another shot and the ratings will be better after i left this place i felt very fat thats a good thing anyways we ordered appetizers and entrees just for my wife and i big mistake we should definately shared a entree the portions were huge we had the stuffed mushrooms and mussles for the appetizers they were great i had the chicken parm and she had the chicken marsala they were bothe great also but like i said we should of just shared a entree i dont see what the big deal is about this place yeah the view is nice and all but the food is pretty average at best we both had the crab cakes and they were horrible and the service sucks we were pretty much ignored the whole time during our meal after the food came the bartenders kept giving a women who was all ready clearly drunk more drinks and she fell on her face right in front of our table and almost knocked it over with no apology from management i shouldve gone to the capital grille instead quick tip great italian food has a small banquet room in the back too a friend of mine recently got married and had his reception here we came in through the back of the restaurant and i was amazed at how beautiful it looked the hallways were decorated with vintage looking furniture and the reception hall itself was beautiful it had a big windown that you can see part of the las vegas strip from lots of light the dinner was sit down buffet style we had three courses appetizer main course and dessert the food was awesome most especially because there was only one dish with tomatoes this was a special italian restaurant and i was so happy to be able to try all their food the salad was excellent fresh lettuce blue cheese and dressing there were two types but i didnt get to taste the other one the calamari was really good too the cheese ravioli was a big hit at our table something so simple was so delicious and felt so light in your mouth there was chicken florentine a steak with mushroom and then eggplant parmesian i heard that this one was the best dish out of the main course but i couldnt sample it guess why p the dessert was cheesecake with strawberries as well as a fruit plate with pineapples honeydew cantaloupes grapes strawberries watermelons fresh everything just tasted so fresh the best part of this dinner was that we found out that this reception place was a restaurant towards the front entrance there is a full bar and it looked like really efficient servers they were all polite too this is a place to definitely check out if you arent interested in buffets or just want to sample a different type of life with vegas definitely a great atmosphere with great food and even better with great friends and family maggianos is delicious italian food at prices that wont break the bank its a nice atmosphere without being pretentious the fried zucchini is delicious they used to have asparagus that was even better the family style menu is awesome and the desserts are to die for they also have a great happy hour m f sun th with discounted drinks and apps tonight i had baked ziti and it was perfect good food at a reasonable price in a very comfortable setting overlooking the strip love maggianos great italian food has never tasted so good portions are large so be sure to eat family style we took our old daughter and she even loved the place seating can be really busy but dont worry as the food makes up for it prices are reasonable and not over the board so its definitely a place to visit great location in the middle of the strip and at the mall normally as a vegas resident the last place you go for a good time to drink is the strip sure its great for all those vacationing there but if you live there you know that you can save the strip for the tourists maggianos little italy is the exception to this the happy hour is one of the best that ive experienced in las vegas boasting appetizers and well drinks with premium drinks and beers this place is a great place to stop after work you have to get there somewhat early or be forced to wait outside the dining area is a bit cramped but its best just to situate yourself at the bar the appetizers are tasty and not of your typical bar flair i usually favored the calamari and tomato mozzarella free italian bread with vinaigrette sauce make it even more delectable all the better to wash down the drinks with with the main dining so close and the tunes of classic jazz standards overhead the ambiance can be busy but it never seemed to escalate over a dull roar so keeping conversation is never a problem along the walls are classic pictures of old vegas and its easy to get stopped along the way to the restrooms and take in these old photos as if you were in a museum the bartenders pour a mean drink and remember the locals well this isnt an easy feat when you serve as many drinks as these guys do each bartender has their specialty drink but dont push it down your throat ask bartender chris about his poma tini its a pomegranate flavored martini that is refreshing smooth and very drinkable sadly ive never had a full fledged meal there the happy hour was always enough for us i have indulged in a slice of the cheesecake which gives the original cheesecake factory a run for its money the filling was smooth and creamy and the strawberry topping tart and sweet and the best part was the price only for this massive chunk maggianos little italy inside the fashion show mall is outstanding and i recommend this place to any friends who are visiting the only think keeping this place from a five star rating is the fact that it does get very busy and sometimes the bartenders tend to lose track of you four stars for great deals strong drinks super hour tasty appetizers this was my first visit to this restaurant the decor is nicely appointed classy yet not ostentatious the wait staff was young but knowledgeable friendly and helpful but never intrusive i had the linguine di mare which was perfectly prepared it was mildly spicy and contained a nice mixture of lobster shrimp mussels and clams though i found it very generous with the lovely shrimp i found it less than generous with the lobster i found one small piece on my plate the clams and mussels were tasty but rather small one of my companions had the seared tuna which he very much enjoyed the portion was large and was cooked perfectly medium rare with an ideal inch seared thickness all around and a rare center my other companion had the parmesan crusted tilapia it was well cooked and tasty we accompanied our dinner with a bottle of their nice house chianti for dessert the three of us shared a generous and quite delicious order of the cannoli cake with two rounds of drinks and tip the bill was for the three of us a very enjoyable experience well suited to a special occasion for a great italian meal and an affordable price on the strip this is the place i have come here for a meal every time i am in vegas for something a little more affordable the great thing is the quality of food and service makes you not miss the pricey hotel restaurants on my most recent trip my wife and i made reservations early afternoon for that night our past couple of visits without reservations we had to wait for a table once we got to the restaurant this time we were seated right away the restaurant was busy for a tuesday night but not as busy as we had seen it before my wife got the chicken parmesan which is a classic and delicious i got the mushroom ravioli which were also quite delicious the service was exceptional our food arrived quickly and our waiter was friendly and helpful for me this place is a must on every trip to vegas i havent gone to a maggianos in a long time first time in the vegas location too i made a reservation on the phone for pm we got there by pm so i asked them if we could be seated they were still pretty empty at that time except at the bar where they had happy hour so they sat us in a nice booth seat our waitress wasnt particularly friendly but she did provide good service overall she didnt go over the specials either but no problem since i can read it myself ordered the half order spinach salad i always forget to ask them to leave the dressing on the side did it again this time too and they put way too much i remember it tasting a little better but its probably because there was too much dressing i do love my grilled veggies and bacon in it though also ordered the calamari it was okay but i wish the marinara was spicy because it tasted kind of plain the warm bread with the olive oil and balsamic was yummy i only ordered two pastas for three people waitress said all their dishes are now half order sized thank goodness i did too because the portions were still pretty big plus i was already more than half full from the appetizers and bread got the pesto chicken linguine and the seafood linguine the pesto chicken linguine had a ton of pesto a little too much but when i reheated it the next day it was so good the seafood linguine had a good amount of seafood and the tomato sauce kept it from getting heavy we took back over of each of the pasta dishes because we were too full by then even for dessert although the waitress wasnt talkative with us she refilled our water checked up on us and gave me two little rolls of ciabatta breads when i asked her to box the few pieces left to go along with our pastas good service and she was well rewarded with a nice tip ive been to maggianos several times in ca but this was my first time in lv the food was good as always the fettucini alfredo was the best ive ever had my sisters chicken parmigiana was pretty tasty too again definitely should share your plates what i loved most about this location was that its right on the strip and if you get a table by the window you get a spectacular view of the wynn across the street and all the bright lights of the strip perfect location for a romantic dinner very predictable and reliable my husband and i have dined at maggianos in san jose santana row near our house several times and also in orlando florida we decided for our last night in vegas we wanted something affordable reliable and relatively quick we had show tickets and had gotten back late from our tour the concierge at encore called to get us a reservation and we were seated right at our reservation time we got there early just in case but we had plenty of time without feeling rushed we ordered the mozzarella appetizer which was delicious husband has his green salad and of course the fresh bread with oil and balsamic vinegar is a huge hit an affordable bottle of wine to share and for entrees my fish loving husband actually ordered the beef tips he said they were wonderful and they came with mashed potatoes with shoestring onion ring crisps bit he was too full to eat the sides i ordered the fettuccine alfredo and it was delicious we passed again on dessert simply no room because the food during dinner was plentiful the location is very central right on the corner of the strip across from the wynn hotel which was perfect for us considering we were staying at encore and had tickets to the show at wynn we would definitely go back again breaking news notorious italian cuisine hater archie g had italian food for dinner and didnt immediately want to vomit afterwards on a business trip in las vegas my speaking manager who does not speak spanish asked me to help him take out our large limited our latin american distributors who dont speak english for dinner somehow i was put in charge of finding a restaurant suitable for all four of us normally i shy away from huge responsibility at work i avoid the break room so i dont have to ever have to take out the trash thats just how lazy i am anyway with this language challenged arrangement i knew it was going to be up to me and my two years of spanish in college to keep the dinner engaging organized and running smoothly luckily for me maggianos helped out with the experience the two chilean clients communicated to me that they loved steak and italian food with the help of my yelp blackberry application i suggested benihana or maggianos and tried not show sadness in my eyes ironically their eyes lit up when they heard maggianos and the date was set for starters the staff here is a superb the hostess helped me make a reservation for a couple hours later so i was able to give the rest of the dinner participants time to get ready as i ran off and went shopping for a little gift for la novia at the nearby mall our server was awesome how lucky was i that the server was chilean he helped out immensely making our chilean clients feel comfortable recommending dishes and beers and making on occasional joke or two great guy great server give that guy a raise as for the food it wasnt terrible we had the all you can eat family style meal which included two salads two appetizers four main courses and two desserts to share and share and share until we were ready to be wheeled out of the restaurant appetizers we had the calamari fritte and stuffed mushrooms the fried calamari was average and the dipping sauce was essentially ragu i liked the stuffed mushrooms and so did the rest of the group as had another round of it however i did wonder why they were not given an italian name on the menu maybe the guy who wrote the menu only took years of italian in college salads the chopped salad was a eally good salad there is no way it can be good for you we also had the italian tossed salad and it was wonderful who doesnt love a good tossed salad by an italian main courses we ordered different main courses the spaghetti meatball and i could have made it better at home the veal ravioli was pretty good it wasnt as heavy as i had imagined the gnocchi tomato vodka sauce was my contribution to the group the gnocchi just melted in your mouth it was the best dish all night and we had another round of it the the salmon lemon herb smelled pretty bad i was afraid to get that on my lips or fingers i didnt want la novia to pick me up from the airport and think i was having an affair or something desserts the creme brulee was pretty good we had three rounds of this i love burnt cream we had the n y style cheesecake and it well it was just plain ol cheesecake i think the n y stood for not your as in not your style cheesecake overall the food was up and down and mostly mediocre it was factory style italian food that lacked much distinctive flavor essentially it was a pricier version of olive garbage or bucket of crappo this was no more than to star food but the ambiance and staff helped make this a very successful business dinner so successful we went out on the town for an adventure that included gambling karaoke and general las vegas debauchery and well i will award another star for that had a group of which is big even in vegas treated us very well fairly fast service and the portions were huge could not believe that if you finished a dish they would keep bringing more out all you can eat with a restaurant atmosphere tasty food but waaaaaaaaaaaaay to much salt we got there around pm and were told to wait min for a table they gave us a buzzer so we went and sat next door after about min we went up to the counter and asked how much longer our table would be the hostess checked their list and looked a little flustered as if our name magically disappeared she immediately seated us our server was pretty good at first i got the famous rigatoni d while my bf got the beef cannelloni both our dishes were very very salty for the beef cannelloni they were very generous with the beef very sparse on the pasta and the carrots were undercooked and very crunchy my rigatoni was a very big portion but so salty i ended up drinking all my water for half the dish this brings me to my second qualm once we got our dishes our server went mia it seemed like everyone around us with bigger parties had very good service while we waited and waited for him to even acknowledge us we had to ask for water and even then it took min to get it overall id say the restaurant was overpriced we ended up spending on just those two entrees and overhyped would i eat here again maybe if someone were treating and only if i have a full glass of water went back again sat at the bar with a friend from long island ny we had a sensational dinner not good but great its basic italian food wine is reasonably priced same wine across the street at the wynn is literally double per bottle if youd like a light lunch dont come here one serve of a main pasta dish will feed a family of for a month serving sizes aside the food is pretty good heaps of flavour fresh herbs and all that good stuff try the specialty flatbreads kinda like a small pizza with some superb combinations on top we had the margharita sp with tiny tomatoes basil and the addition of spicy sausage there are plenty of wines by the glass including an oz wine or nice place overlooking the strip and being right down one end it doesnt seem to be as over subscribed as some we had our wedding reception here let me tell you after shopping the hotels for receptions we knew this was the place for us we spoke with marc the event person and he showed us their private rooms since we had about people attending it was very affordable the menu we choose was a family style course meal with appetizers since we had some older people attending the family style service was great it was all you can eat but they served everything at the tables so no buffet type of lines everything was done through email and a few phone calls and it was done cassie the second in charge for catering was extremely helpful shop around but the food is second to none and the service staff during the reception were very professional and friendly if you have any type of event in vegas check this place out you cant beat the prices and the food is awesome youre probably wondering why would anyone go to maggianos during their vegas trip hey i love maggianos and when you know theres a good place to eat whether its vegas boston philly etc you stick to it as always they never disappoint me i ordered the same stuff as i always do their mussels for appetizer and of course i always order chicken and spinach manacotti which is yummy i stayed at mgm but i walked all the way over to fashion mall just to eat at maggianos and no regrets bc it was totally worth it loved it good atmosphere great fooooood oh and the dessert yes now there was a odd conversation we overheard about a guy who was name dropping a whole bunch as if he was some high roller other than that loved the restaurant service and food this place was sooo close to getting stars however one thing changed my mind i had a reservation in the lunch hours and i was on time and on my reservation notes i proposed a booth it wasnt ready when i got there so we had to take a timer and stand around minutes later we got the booth and it was facing outside which was a good view this is the only reason it didnt get stars the booth took way to long to get and even when i put it for in advance the server was nice and quick and explained the menu just right the food was amazing i love italian food and decided to go with lasagna and it was hot and fresh tasting it wasnt a loud place and was very clean i wil love to come back to try something else on the menu its been a few years since i ate here and i was shopping and hungry so there ya go it was about on a sunday no wait for a table they sat me and my little guy down at a nice table in the corner i ordered a very tasty raspberry iced tea and had one of the specials it was a crap and sweet shrimp fondue with several toasty wedges to scoop up the fondue ryder had the angel hair pasta with olive oil and cheese sprinkled on it we both dug right in when it arrived which it did very fast i would give this stars but the server let my tea run out and didnt refill it for about minutes after it was empty not a huge deal but the tea was really good and i would have drank glasses of it but i had she was also a bit slow with getting us the check and bringing me the change i will have to let that slide tho since the food was top notch another affordable dining spot on the strip for those times when youve just bet everything on red and its black fare is solid american italian in a spacious dining room on the second floor of fashion show mall the linguine di mare is the stuff of my foodie dreams linguine noodles the best kind in a spicy tomato sauce not spicy enough for me smothered in seafood goodness like plump juicy shrimp mussels clams and lobster my only regret was i had to leave some of the pasta behind or risk blowing chunks atop the stratosphere after stupid stomach thats sensitive to stupid spinning my boyfriends lobster carbonara could solve world hunger there was so much of it it was creamy deliciousness bathed in lobster groupies yuuuum service was pretty slow though so try not to come during peak lunch hour on saturday i could definitely do without the creepy guy walking around playing the accordian but ill put up with it for the really yummy food and fun ambiance we have eaten here several times and ordered pretty much everything on the menu at one time or another and have never been disappointed some things are better than others of course try the chicken and spinach manicotti mmmmmm but overall the quality has always been good the service fast and if you can get a window seat the view is great for people watching oh and it sounds really plain and boring but trust me try the pound cake for dessert yum i brought my girlfriend here for her birthday while we were livin it up in vegas a week earlier i reserved a table for pm we arrived about minutes early and were invited to relax at the bar until our table was ready sure enough bang on pm we were strutting through the restaurant over to our fantastic table for two with a killer view we ordered a wealth of food and some delicious red wine sangria the food was perfect i think we did that thing again where we stop talking for the duration of the meal due to rapid consumption of said delicious food our waiter couldve been around a little more but was very friendly and responsive all other times so its cool im gonna go head and call this the place to eat when you come to the strip the total for appetizers entrees drinks and dessert was easily the same price that the high end restaurants charge for one person not to mention the lack of food those high end places bring to the table maggianos is perfect for dressing up chowing down and hitting the clubs and casinos after service here is great came here to celebrate a friends birthday we got hooked up with a nice table right by the window with an awesome view of the strip our waiter was on it always coming by asking if we had questions about the menu he brought out our drinks right away he was even nice enough to bring out small bowls of salad without any meat in them because one of our friends didnt eat meat so considerate we had a party of so we decided to order family style appetizers salads entrees with unlimited refills on all food best idea ever we got a taste of everything and there was more than enough food to go around i love this place so my dad said this italian eatery in vegas was one of the best italian foods he has eaten before since my mom and i didnt really know what we wanted to eat for lunch it was a why not kind of thing we got there and was seated within mins granted this was a lunch hour so im guessing there were fewer people there personally i didnt like our waiter he sounded insincere i know that they dont really care whether youve eaten there or not or if the food it good or not just act better we ordered the fried calamari for the appetizer i really liked it my mom ordered the shrimp and crab imperial that was yummy my dad ordered some lobster alfredo that was also delicious i ordered a steak bruschettasp and it was absolutely delightful it was the right portion and i loved eating it since im not a food expert thats all i can give with the food the blood orange italian soda tasted good too it comes in a fancy bottle overall i much enjoyed this restaurant but if i ever want to eat legit italian food it would be at my friends house i love this place my first visit was a few years ago after my brother in law said my husband and i had to go i make my share if trips to las vegas and i go out of my way to eat at maggianos the decor is very nice love the dark wood and old vegas pictures the look of the place gives an impression of a much more expensive restaurant but i think the prices are very reasonable compared to some other local restaurants the service is always great and ive always enjoyed everything ive ordered my favorite is the tuscan sausage and orzo soup i order it every time a must for every vegas trip this review is for the service that we received at dinner last week our waiter donny was the worst waiter we have ever had if you go to maggianos and get donny as your waiter prepare to be insilted and treated like idiots when you ask him a simple question no need to go into details but trust me on this it is a shame because the waiter serving the table next to us was absolutely wonderful and very professional note to donny if you do not like people you probably should get out of the customer service business my husband and i dined here during our honeymoon in vegas we shared a portion of salad liguine with clams and a couple of glasses of wine the food tasted great we made a reservation before we arrived which recommend for a friday night in vegas the server was nice and attentive so our experience here was positive i would come here again i am not sure who reviews this place but i know now it is not worth the rating that it is receiving we went here for dinner on a sunday night supposedly low season in vegas the place was crowded but that was not so much of an issue the noise level in the restaurant was pretty high but if you are lucky you might get a table with a good view of the strip we ordered the steamed mussels and crab cakes for appetizer the grilled salmon on a bed of spinach with roasted potatoes kids ate the flat bread pizza and spaghetti with giant meatball crab cakes were okay the sauce that comes with it is nice mussels in red sauce diablo if i remember well when served they smelled funny my first impression was that the mussels were steamed and a can of crushed tomatoes was thrown over them some spaghetti strings were visible so i was wondering where the sauce really came from but that was not the problem the smell was just unbearable that i could not eat these mussels returned them and was notified by the waitress that it was not the first time that the mussels smelled manager came and offered us another dish we ordered the fried calamari and it was okay salmon on a bed of spinach with roasted potatoes the salmon was a bit overcooked and was sitting in the juices of the spinach not very appetizing to see i like grilled fish to remain dry when served the potatoes were really overcooked and very dry on the inside they were left to roast just beyond what they needed flat bread pizza not too bad for a kids meal spaghetti with giant meatball i am not sure what people like about giant food but for me it looks disgusting we were not charged for the mussels nor for the fried calamari which is great customer service overall maybe worth a two or three star but definitely not more than that if you grade it on the food this is probably the best italian chain restaurant that ive ever eaten at not only did i enjoy the atmosphere and service the food was phenomenal to start off a very nice family vacation we decided to eat at maggianos and try their family style dinner the server who is probably the best ive ever met warned us that it will be a lot of food and very heavy we took on the challenge and tried their classic dinner appetizers salads main courses and desserts appetizers barbs spinach and artichoke dip calamari fritte they split the spinach and artichoke dip into two plates and had a giant plate of fried calamari both were excellent dishes the calamari was not overcooked and the dip was just gooey perfection salad caesar and spinach im not a big salad eater but i heard it was excellent main course chicken piccata chicken saltimbocca grilled salmon lemon herb and linguini clams with red sauce each dish was amazing the piccata was not overcooked or drowning in sauce the saltimbocca which is fried chicken patties wrapped in prosciutto and cheese was just delicious the salmon was good and the linguini was not drowning in sauce and just the right amount of clams dessert tiramisu and creme brulee both were just perfect the tiramisu was just so delicious not too sweet and not too bland the creme brulee had the perfect golden crust and was so smooth yes it is a lot of food for a table of five but it gets better for those who think a person is a bit too much each plate from the appetizer to the desert is refillable they wont stuff giving you until you tell them no more so for the price the service and the food maggianos is definitely worth it we went here because we got a gift card for xmas i thought it was delish we stared off with the calamari was a little under seasoned but not fishy the complementary bread was great and then we had a chicken flatbread that was good the waitress was the nicest ever we had a fifty dollar gift card and ended up using on dinner and two drinks and gave the rest to her for being super nice would go again even without a gift card stars is generous after my last trip there which was on thanksgiving it was my th year in a row eating here on thanksgiving i booked a month out and was told the earliest available was pm we were seated quickly but thats the only thing that went right we ordered all parts of the course family style holiday menu and half of what we ordered showed up they ran out of food at an all you can eat meal instead of being upfront with us we got a dog and pony type of magic show disappearing food when i approached the manager he asked what do you want me to do about it are you kidding me per person and you do not have what we want i am fairly certain i will never go back thats coming from a chicago guy who loves italian food also their regular menu item portions have been cut in half and the price slashed a buck or two lame my boyfriend took me here for our one year anniversary and it was such a perfect place for a romantic dinner he made reservations for two and when we got there the table was ready and they were waiting for us they had us sat at such a beautiful spot next to the window in front of the wynn hotel which is always a sight to see we were immediately treated with bread and balsamic vinegar which was very good the bread was warm and soft and they kept coming with them and the balsamic vinegar was also so tasty we ordered our food and did not wait more then mins but we enjoyed it because they had a man walking around playing the violin very beautifuly we loved it when we got our dinner it was very delicious and the portions were great the price was also very reasonable for a restaurant on the strip they had plate all the way up to dishes but they had all the italian classics and many seafood dishes which was what my boyfriend had and said it was great i highly recomend this restaurant for people who need a good warm meal in a great soothing atmosphere the only reason why i gave maggianos little italy stars was because towards the end of our meal the waiter was standing not very far from our table staring us down waiting for us to finish up and leave i found it a little rude and uncomfortable but other then those last mins it was a great experience we ate here on nye and the service from nestor was the best the location overlooking the strip was great and the interior dark wood style was very nice i recommend the salmon and the pork medallions i wont let you turn around and tell me now im much too proud all you do is fill me up with doubt this time baby ill be bulletproof at maggianos la roux bulletproof thank god this place was where i thought it was i remember seeing the wynn when i came here a long time ago from the windows since it is on the nd floor of its structure but you are never sure especially since i was running on redbulls for the day and had like hours of sleep from the night before it was so cold and we were hungry and i was leading us to this place that i thought was here and it was yay the portions here are awesome by the way too bad its hard to keep leftovers when you are around in vegas which is what happened to me lol anyways ordered the lobster pasta and there was a good amount of lobster chunks in it the side salad had a good portion to it too so i would recommend that if you want the veggies the ciabatta bread in the beginning was tasty and wanted more wish i saved room for dessert not possible here oof maybe next time outside of vegas food stars service stars atmosphere stars pricevalue stars men looking to take your gf or soon to be gf or wife on a nice cheap date maggianos is the place to go my absolute favorite italian restaurant i come here about at least twice a month and ive always enjoyed the atmosphere and their delicious food make sure you try their caesars salad because they honestly have the best caesars salad everything else ive had on their menu has been phenomenal at maggianos youre able to substitute or subtractadd items you dont like they also serve bread so an appetizer isnt needed unless you want to order them on weekends its probably best if you make a reservation just in case cause they can make you wait mins for just people but they do accept walk ins as well if youre up for the wait or just in the area average bill for ppl with orders of side caesars salad and beverages excluding alcohol is roughly that price for good food fancy looking restaurant and is on the strip is hard to find maggianos is conveniently located in the fashion show mall below the capital grille it was my first time here and the food was better than i had expected i went with my beautiful girlfriend for lunch she had signed up for their mailing list and received a coupon good for off our total meal the server was really nice and she even gave us her card at the end of the meal after she had learned that we were locals we ordered chicken fetuccini alfredo baked ziti and the fried zuchinni as an appetizer we were about to order more than the fried zuchinni for an appetizer but im glad we didnt they turned out to be zuchinni spears and they were huge the breading on the zuchinni was to die for it was cooked to perfection i wonder if they used panko to bread it i highly recommend it the ziti was not that impressive at all it was way too meaty and sauce was bland in taste my alfredo was good and rich in taste i had no complaints about the service they even were able to give us a window seat when we asked no reservation made we had a good view of the strip and wynn casino id definitely come here again i would have scored them star but the ziti knocked em down next time i want to try their calamari great restaurant great food great service it was truly an amazing night followed by mystere which was an amazing show as well even had the little old men come to the table to serenade us lol my boyfriend suggested this place as an option for lunch because i wanted to eat some type of noodle on our bday for long life and ive been craving italian of course i made a reservation on opentable went to the website checked out the menu signed up for the email list and received a off coupon right away its kind of nice because when you sign up they give you a off coupon and when you submit more info on your profile for them they give you another coupon for a free dessert i stuck with the coupon though since i had more than enough birthday cake already our reservation was at pm we came in and all the booths with views were taken but they were able to give us one of their seater tables right next to the window so that was nice we got our water and complimentary bread right away and the waitress came over to give us some suggestions on appetizers she suggested the bruschetta but we ended up ordering fried zucchini after looking over the menu we decided to order fettuccine w chicken and baked ziti ive never ordered baked ziti from a restaurant its always been at little food courts in shopping malls so i was hoping for something pretty delicious the zucchini arrived and boy were they huge my boyfriend and i both looked at the zucchini then at each other and said at the same time wow those are zucchini spears there was about of them so we got three each it was pretty tasty the breading was light and the lemon aioli went perfectly with it it was a little too big for two though especially since you get the complimentary bread i was only able to finish a spear and a half our food came and it looked delicious i almost dove right in without taking pictures i took a bite of my ziti and i was a little disappointed it just tasted very salty and not at all like i expected maybe im just so used to the ziti at the mall which i love that im not used to authentic style ziti i tried my boyfriends fettuccine shortly after and that dish was heavenly im really happy he let me take the leftovers home i really didnt eat much of my ziti at all especially after trying the fettuccine i think i just ordered the wrong dish im sure their other dishes are yummy we asked for a togo box and gave the waitress the coupon she came back with an aluminum container with a cardboard top and a little baggy of fresh bread i think our bill only came up to about dollars because of the coupon so that was definitely a nicely priced lunch overall the food was delicious except for the ziti the service was quick and courteous the view was beautiful stars and id love to come back to try their dessert my family and a friend met up at maggianos in fashion show and im experiencing mixed feelings about it locations great place to meet but mall closes before the restaurant it makes the underground parking difficult to access consider using the valet service our server was very nice but she also presented the olive oilbalsamic vinegar plate in front of my four year old it was a very messy spill food pretty good overall the fried zucchini appetizer is always good my friends chicken salad looked fine and my pepperoni flat bread was not interesting in the slightest summary ill go back if encouraged but great italian food is easy to come by in las vegas im not rushing back i was introduced to this restaurant when i use to work in the oc i love this chain compared to olive garden every time i have been to a maggianos whether it is oc or here i always seem to wait a little just my luck probably we like the atmosphere and the food is good below are the usual that we order appetizers bruschetta stuffed mushrooms pastas spaghetti meatball fettuccine alfredo lasagna desserts creme brulee tiramisu pastas are very well prepared as well but our favorites that keep us coming back are the appetizers and desserts this is definitely one of my favorite restaurants to go to the only thing that was a turn off for us for this location was that the outdoor dining we had to put up with someone that was smoking at a nearby table we have kids so this was rather inconvenient i like this place the service is excellent they have a full bar the flat bread is good start also the calamari the lobster carbonara is great i also the seafood pasta is good i tasted the salmon as well i think i will order that next time one thing you should do is call ahead for reservations this will save you some headaches waiting also allow a extra minutes get through the strip traffic and parking my husband and i had our wedding dinner here with a small group of guests total we did a family style dinner which i was allowed to order before we arrived so everything would be brought out without waiting a long time the food was delicious we had a lot of food left over for lunch the next day it tasted even better our waiter was fabulous as well as very friendly family style is definitely the way to go if you have a big group and are on a tight budget thank you everyone at maggianos great place waitress was kind of slow but still attentive we always end up eating here at least once every time someone comes to visit us my husband is a big fan of italian food so it works out great he can never get sick of spaghetti but i like trying different things chicken alfredo or chicken marsala seem to be my main dishes the location is perfect shop a little til you get hungry then go to maggianos or eat first then shop either way its a win win there might be quite a wait if you go around or pm but if you go there for lunch or something it works out perfect this place is great i recommend the homemade lasagna i would definently go again what got me disappointed a little was the server she was slow my sister who lives in vegas took me here with her friends when i was visiting with so many options on the strips i was wondering why this was one of her favorites located in the fashion show mall the restaurant has easy access and parking it has a great location the ambiance is just like every other maggianos with only about of the tables having a view of the strip we had made reservations for pm on a wednesday night and arrived minutes late granted the restaurant was packed as ever but there were empty tables the maitre de gave us such a stern look of disapproval and then gave us a buzzer to wait near the bar we waited for almost another minutes are you kidding me when we were finally seated at a table in the back it took us way longer than expected to get the attention of the waiter to take our order maybe they have a problem with the ratio of tables per waiter we could see that he was working hard but we were hungry as well the food was delicious as expected all of us were stuffed and enjoyed our meal we actually loved the two elderly men who came to sing at our table the one with the violin reminded us of the man in up with such good food we were happy to have several boxes of leftovers to enjoy the next day but then at the end of the night when we were paying the bill we asked the waiter to split the bill amongst the guests one of our friends actually paid in cash and the waiter actually assumed that his bill was his tip this is before we got the receipt back to sign the waiter assumed and gave himself a tip that has never happened to me before and sadly i have to say he didnt deserve it overall we had a great time and i wouldnt mind coming back but i would hope they would improve on their service between then this is a chain restaurant but it doesnt feel like it its interior suggests something closer to fine dining but the prices are actually really reasonable one of the best things about it is the view it has its pretty basic italian food but youll feel like you are getting more than your moneys worth will never come here ever again horrible service this is by far the best maggianos ive been too ive been to the california location as well as the washington d c location and this one takes the cake my boyfriend and i make a week trip to vegas every summer this past year we decided to dine at maggianos afters having a good experience in cali the food here is soooooo good we ended up dining here more times before we left i recommend going with a group of or more because they have great package deals for larger parties you can choose between different price groups all that come with different options which are all reasonable and well worth the money im absolutely gaga no lady stay out of this one over their chicken francese and their mash potatoes to die their chicken francese is not traditional however it is breaded and then smothered in lemon sauce im drooling just thinking about it did i mention they dont stop bringing more food until you tell them too go hungry this maggianos is pretty pleasant perhaps an alternative restaurant if you just spent too long at fashion show and cannot dare cross the street the obstacle of crossing the street from point a to point b has left me minutes late plenty of times even if its just from saks to the wynn also a good restaurant for bigger portions their plates can be a foot long for a single person big portions a homey feeling which is very common for them stars to be fair i went to maggianos for lunch during a business seminar dont you just love some free food every once in a while for all your hard work it was certainly a nice treat for me after initial introductions and the start of the seminar food starting coming out of the kitchen all served family style which was a bit odd for me because i barely knew the two dozen people in the room but ah not a big deal as long as none of them had herpes or mono or a cold for that matter our appetizer courses came first along with warm french bread excellent we had the tomato caprese tomatoes topped with fresh mozzarella and basil topped with olive oil and balsamic glaze mozzarella marinara breaded mozzarella with marinara sauce maggianos salad iceberg and romaine lettuce with bleu cheese crispy prosciutoo red onions topped with their signature dressing pretty good start the salad was crisp but my fav was the tomato caprese sweet and ripe tomatoes with the silky cheese and the acidic touch from the balsamic very nice i didnt try the mozzarella marinara in trying to keep with my px diet damn you i say tony horton next up was our main courses chicken parmesan breaded chicken breasts baked with provolone cheese and marinara sauce over spaghetti our famous rigatoni d rigatoni with herb roasted chicken mushrooms and caramelized onions with a marsala cream sauce moms lasagna meat sauce pasta layered with ricotta cheese meatballs italian sausage and marinara sauce topped with provolone cheese and meat sauce nice all were good unfortunately i ate like a banshee here i dug the chicken parmesan and moms lasagna very much the sauce was great not too sweet not too tart and complemented the dishes very well oh my thighs the horror after the business presentation dessert was brought out apple crostada granny smith apples baked in a pastry crust topped with crystallized sugar topped with caramel sauce and vanilla bean ice cream chocolate zuccotto cake chocolate cake layered with sambuca chocolate mousse iced with chocolate frosting then dusted with cocoa powder at this point i was too full to have any more but i gave in and had a bit of the apple crostada yummy to my tummy the tart apples went well with the sweet sugar crust good way to end the meal bad way to end my diet food here is great for a chain restaurant the ambiance is nice dark woods and colors it would be very nice for a date night out i may just come back here again and actually shell out my visa to try more of their dishes as a note though i did look through the menu and see a lot of their dishes are on the pricey side but one dish could probably feed two people easily thankful for my one day reprieve i am back to my px diet and the ramblings of the devils spawn named tony horton one more push up or pull up and i think im gonna be sick more like it they put lots of food on the plates its just that its really nothing too special the best of the lot we tried were the mussels and the side spinach salad was okay as well as for the veal picata or the crab cakes would pass on them wines in the limited selection are reasonably priced along with the large portions prices are reasonable and that keeps the place packed with patrons reservations are recommended of my girls and i went to vegas to celebrate of their birthdays we didnt have the coupon for bogo but he still let us take home classic pastas home for free with the order of classic pastas at the mention of the coupon service was great and i cant get enough of the balsamic vinegar nd oil and bread although he did forget about the birthdays and i had to remind him again to bring out the cookies in the end since it was a classic pasta the lasagna was a little dry fettucini was extremely bland but the spaghetti was really goodand came with a good portion this was my nd time here and the first time was in san jose my first experience was better because we didnt do the bogo and ordered specialty pastas and seafood but i guess you get what you pay for horrible food poisoning my first night moving to las vegas i ate there and got terrible food poisoning i had a steak and got what was most likely e coli poisoning would not recommend going to this place there are much better places for italian food even without the food poisoning ii have a gluten problem and have celiac disease i have been to this restraunt several times over times the food is very good however if you have an allergy or a gluten problem i can no longer suggest this restraunt the last out of times i had eaten there they brought me out my salad with croutins in the salad which some of you who have the problem becomes a big problem thank god i caught this before i ate it i ordered my meal through the chef per usual times they brought me out items that have gluten out of the last times i ate there the problem is they have no checking sytem there a diffrent waiter brings out your food they have no idea whats going on the margin for era is to great they say they accomodate allergies and gluten free the problem is the caring level is not there anymore in this place note both times this happened at the restraunt it was not a weekend or that busy so that excuse is down the drain my question to the manger was what if this was a child that had a serius allergy and went into shock then what he said it never happens my response funny to me i was here weeks ago and the same thing happened there was no response i went here for lunch and will not return with so many options in vegas for food the details count i asked for maggianos salad and i received it although it tasted like it was premade hours prior with soggy lettuce the flatbread was good and the service was bad hence the stars a restaurant such as this should not be sending out pre made salads with soggy lettuce we have had good experiences here and not so great ones it is after all a chain restaurant and lacks the personalization we prefer the lasagna is the highlight of the menu i am not a huge lasagna fan so i often find myself trying some type of seafood dish which i have found they over sauce the service was decent but we prefer to pick up here rather than dine in as it has a stuffy feel to the atmosphere pros good take out yummy lasagna cons ambiance seafood dishes im all in for this place i just wish i felt better to better enjoy the food after a wicked friday night i just wasnt feeling it def needed some food and well the gf and were set on finding something gluten friendly enter maggianos and their gluten free pasta not to mention you can actually talk to the chef if you have some question a i ordered up the angle hair pasta with italian sausage and some kind of chunky diced tomato sauce awesome it was that was the gf chopped it up with the chef for a minute and he came back with a baked zitti corn pasta type thing with chicken and tons of cheese i stole a bite or two and yup yummo the place looks super upscale and ultra expensive but really for where youre at and it being on the strip it a must go amazing italian food good service great for large groups we had people and ordered family style and had more food than we knew what to do with i will continue to go here every time i am in v town closes at pm on saturday night wth this is las vegas for heavens sake we rolled in at about pm and were denied it was a sad sad morning when i realized that with my newly gluten free ness i couldnt run to greasy pizza as a hangover remedy i was soooo so happy to find maggianos though the bf and i were on a quest and we came across the menu that graciously advertised gluten free pasta so in we went the server was a super happy fella who brought the chef over to customize my meal basically however i wanted i ended up with some baked corn pasta with chicken marinara sauce and cheese delicious its classy inside but the lunch prices were totally fine for vegas standards that is plus the portions were huge the waiter kept our water coming and even gave the bf two glasses at a time as i was shopping at fashion show mall i noticed this italian restaurant and made a mental note to check it out on yelp later for a possible dinner option according to yelp this place was worth trying i used the open table feature to make a reservation not knowing if it was really needed or not but i figured why not im glad i did when we made it in to the restaurant it was packed and there was a wait we were seated immediately we were seated in a comfortable booth seat and served water immediately and given some explanation of the menu this place had a good variety of italian food from pastas to chicken beef and seafood selections i liked that they had a family style option as well at first glance i would say this place looks pricey specially since your entree comes with just your entree no salad or soup like olive garden we ordered a side salad to share that was but it was the perfect size for two specially since we were stuffing our faces with the yummy french bread served with olive oil and vinegar oh so yummy and dangerous our plates took over minutes to arrive if it was not for the bread and salad i would have been more upset i ordered moms lasagna made with meatballs and sausage with your choice of marinara or meat sauce i choose marinara since so much meat came with the dish already my plate arrived and what do you know it probably could have served four people fairly large portions i ate all of it in phases but i ate it all it was exquisite perfect layering the lasagna stayed together i hate when you cut into lasagna and the layers fall apart my favorite part was being serenaded by a duo violin and guitar to one of my wedding songs its impossible if it werent for the wynn in the background i could almost say i was in italy i dont have any complaints about this place our total bill came to two entrees one side salad and one beverage we came on a monday night and it was busy so definitely try and make reservations if you can this has to be my favorite italian restaurant in vegas it feels like you just wanna be with your family when you come here eggplant parmesan with meat sauce is one of my faves i wouldnt normally order fried calamari at any other restaurant but its the first thing i wanna order when i get here its light and not chewy which i looove my son eats up most of his spaghetti and cant get enough mamas lasagna is pretty mean too im looking forward to trying other stuff on the menu but all i can think about is the eggplant parm this place is always good nice atmosphere no long waits food is great best of all its located on the strip within the fashion show mall my only advice arrive by pm for dinner or you may have a bit of a wait stopped by for lunch and wasnt disappointed i got the chicken piccata loved it and hubby got the lobster carbonara fantastic bread was nice fresh all soft yummy inside the crispy exterior but the side salads were rather boring will definitely go there again good portions good prices and delicious food i had no idea that the best meal i would eat in las vegas would be at the mall of all places we had a meal at craftsteak and id trade it for the one we had here any day our server was a tiny bubbly blonde who i wish i could have put in my pocket and taken home with me she was sweet and happy and very personable we ordered an appetizer of and then i had the fettuccine alfredo while my husband ordered linguine and clams with the white sauce the app was simply prepared and just lovely my alfredo was smooth and creamy it was very flavorful and not oily at all the linguine was bursting with clams nicely prepared with most of the clams tossed in with the pasta and a handful still in shells scattered over top the wine sauce was fantastic we also had red wine which was their special house red blend also excellent we were completely stuffed and declined dessert but our awesome waitress showed us that they serve little mini desserts for just i went with the chocolate cake and my husband got the creme brulee they were both of course to die for so good in the end i found myself not wanting to go back to the hotel and leaving the lovely atmosphere with lots of frank sinatra playing in the background and warm comfortable interior of the restaurant it was just lovely like i said best meal we had the whole trip ive been here a few times mostly its been good but there is only one good thing i can say about my experience with maggianos this last time the waitress was great she was on the ball all night but the meal was horrible i could not believe how bad it was it wasnt just one thing it was everything from the bread to the wine yes even the wine was bad i couldnt finish the meal and no i did not take a to go box they must have a new juan or hector cooking the food in the kitchen it certainly didnt taste like an italian was cooking terrible meal came back to maggianos for what my friend and i call wine wednesday we used to have this event of people haha every week but as we all know people get busy i find it a great place for happy hour wine and appetizers they have added some new items to the menu from when we used to go but thats great i had last my voice the previous weekend so the bartenders were having a good time with me while i waited for my friends they are very friendly guys and very attentive i got there about pm and found seating at the bar right away once my friends did get there i ordered the merlot and the bartenders were on top of it for food i ordered the bruschetta and crab cakes soooo yummy i think i could continually eat the crab cakes just keep them coming overall my experience here is always great the food always comes out perfect and great service i have yet to come and eat for dinner whats holding me back oh yah i live in the nw and this place is easy to come to after work one day i will though i went here for a wedding dinner party so considering that they were serving a party of about they did an awesome job we had so much food i must have gained lbs leaving there we had a variety of different dishes from spinach artichoke dip bruschetta lasagna spaghetti fetticuni alfredo i cant even remember the rest but it was very good all of it the servers served all of us quickly the food was hot and delicious and the ambiance was very romantic i was in between and stars on this one but i had such a good time i bumped it up the wait was a bit long but decent considering that it was a friday evening in vegas with no reservation this place is not expensive especially for what you are getting also it has a much nicer feel than any other family italian eateries without being stuffy once seated we received pretty good service with a smile i wasnt able to try the bread that was complimentary but everyone at my table seemed to enjoy it the apps calamari and zucchini were delish at some point in the evening we were serenaded by two men playing instruments i have fond memories of steve singing along lol everyone also seemed to enjoy their pasta dishes this place serves everything family style so if you dont want to share be prepared to take a doggy bag i ordered the pesto linguine with chicken and it was delicious warning you should really love pesto to order this dish we were way too full to have any dessert but the options sounded promising tip they have skinny cocktails if thats your thing i had the skinny sangria and it was yummy too bad it didnt matter with all of the food that i inhaled in addition to the outstanding food and service the servers at the bar were friendly and showed genuine interest in new and regular customers their italian food and wine selection are excellent but this time around i tried their grilled salmon a very busy place but worth the short wait i cant believe i just found out about this place im a huge fan after just one visit i was blown away by the tiramasu the service was incredible the entrees were delicious the atmosphere was very elegant as well you really cant compare maggianos to the other chain italian places because they are in a category all their own maggianos is a nice place to go to when guest are in town it is a step above olive garden but not as costly as raos there is always a line so that is a good sign that they are doing something right it has been more than two years since i have been able to get back to this italian restaurant i wanted to see if it is as good as i remembered when a friend came into town it was the perfect opportunity to visit the wait was estimated for minutes so we grabbed a drink at the bar they make a skinny sangria that tastes like fruit punch it is lethal and easy to knock back my friend ordered the frozen peach bellini and it tasted like a smoothie most of the drinks cost around dollars not bad for being on the strip when we were sat the server promptly greeted us and filled our water glasses the service was impeccable she was friendly attentive and non intrusive we had ordered the calamari appetizer to give us some time to decide on our entree apparently it took some time to come out but we did not notice caught up in our conversation and snacking on the bread made time go by quickly our waitress gave some great suggestions and i decided on a dish that would help the make a wish foundation right now they have a few specialty items that maggianos will donate a portion of the proceeds to the charity the roasted chicken farfalle is delicious the bow tie pasta was cooked al dente the chicken moist generous amounts of spinach sun dried tomatoes asparagus topped with parm slivers the broth like sauce at the bottom made the dish light i was happy that i could get something that was not cream based and not have to settle for marinara my friend had ordered the chicken pesto pasta and it was good you must love basil and pesto to get this meal because it is bold i would order it again overall this was a nice meal i would not hesitate to go back but next time i will skimp on the bread to save some room for dessert this was quite possibly the best maggianos experience i have had across three states when another reviewer claimed that it was a step above the olive garden they were spot on my mother and i went here for thanksgiving dinner while in vegas avoiding family obligations we were able to make reservations online which was fairly convenient and helped us avoid a long wait we were also able to order off of the special thanksgiving menu which was a great mix of the traditional thanksgiving fare coupled with some italian favorites they also brought you more of anything you wanted in spite of the original portions being humongous overall our experience was nice and we talk of a repeat dodging of the manicness that is thanksgiving with the inclusion of our maggianos experience i was with a group of ten and after finally deciding on italian food for dinner we headed to maggianos it was a monday night at pm and it was pretty crowded we were told that we had to order off the family style menu even though the menu clearly states that they ask parties of or more to order family style there was no mention anywhere that this was required after asking if it was possible to order individual entrees the hostess looked at us like we were stupid and asked why i simply stated we all have different tastes and one person in our party had food allergies then what looked like the manager came over and told us that the kitchen could not accommodate a group of ten individual entrees and that the only way we could do that is if we split into two groups of five however this would make the wait even longer we were confused because the kitchen would still be making ten orders but whatever we were annoyed with them already and decided to leave and check out el segundo sol the mexican restaurant right below maggianos read my review of el segundo sol they definitely took care of us italian is not always my favorite because it typically involves a lot of carbs i am best staying away from it of course i always manage to order anything but pasta so i am probably missing the best part ive been here a few times and never been there without a min wait nevertheless i enjoyed the service and the food each time ive been there its not cheap but you will for sure leave with a very full stomach personally i find the musicians performance somewhat annoying maybe because i have always come here with a group and its hard to have a conversation with that in the background i am not sure if i was on a honeymoon i would like it either just not working for me this place was pretty good the bread they brought to the table was ok but the salad and the lasagna i ordered were both good and the mini cheesecake at the end was sooo yummy my boss who is um particular didnt have such a good experience as his pasta was over done but the waiter was nice and replaced it for him im a pretty laid back diner so i kinda felt bad when my boss corrected him etc but he handled it well they were great about refilling my water a ton of times im on dr orders to drink over a gallon a day so he helped me along this place is like a fancy buca di beppo we ordered the old famous rigatoni baked ziti pasta and the surf and turf the only thing i enjoyed was the famous rigatoni very flavorful and delicious the baked ziti pasta was very bland and tasteless the surf and turf was a mistake for a pasta place went here for dinner over the weekend and man my experience here was really good the place was really kept nice real clean and the staff was incredible i had the new york steak oz which was amazing our waiter taylor did a real good job waiting on us and always kept coming back to see if we needed water or anything else overall i would recommend this place if your in town and want to dine on some good italian food i love the ambiance here and sometimes if you want the vegas strip but not the feeling of chaos this is the place to be lunch on the patio is fantastic and is quite a unique people watching scene i love their salads wine menu and chicken marsala usually the service is great and the kitchen is consistent be careful of the followingtheir salads are spot on but their house dressing is on the sweeter side i personally prefer the italian which is homemade but not nearly as sweet also if you are not a fan of shaved chicken breast then you should avoid adding chicken to your salads it is not your usual chunky breast this establishment is way better than your typical italian chain and has incredible family portions salute to maggianos you keep me coming back for more spent our one year anniversary lunch here while in vegas we couldnt really decide where to go and were in the mood for italian so we decided to give it a try we were seated immediately and our server was extremely nice and attentive with great recommendations we started with garlic bread garlicky but not overwhelming it was good i had the chicken marsala which i really enjoyed the chicken was moist and the marsala sauce was just enough my boyfriend had the baked ziti and he really enjoyed the pasta as well it was al dente with the right amount of saucesausagecheese overall it was a good experience will definitely go back again when in rome do as the romans when in fashion show mall eat at maggianos the fired zucchini app is my wifes favorite item on the menu portions are large and certainly shareable for lunch and dinner leftovers will be available the following day i like this place a lot i love the food here it is really worth the price which really isnt bad for the quality or quantity i have been here twice and the only down side was the service our first server was decent yet our second server was unobservant and somewhat rude this place is a true gem on the las vegas strip walking into this place you would think its a five star restaurant with prices to match but thankfully the prices here were very affordable and in true italian style the portions were very large we would have taken what we had left over to go but with no place to heat it up at our hotel it wasnt worth it located in the fashion mall if you love italian food this is the place to be very good food nothing mind blowing but a solid italian meal kind of similar in quality to bucca di beppo we would go back food is really good price is very reasonable for that quality and quantity the chicken pesto and bruschetta were delicious it wasnt too heavy like other italian restaurant that ive tried service is great and the atmosphere is good too i love the booth its very comfortable the only reason why i didnt give this place a star is because i was a little disappointed at the cleaniness of this place the second time i went there i figured there was a kid sitting in our booth before us and the floor and seats were full of crumbs and very dirty seriously the booster seat was still under the table other than that this place is very good definitely worth a try my husband and i came here for lunch and the wait was pretty long so we opted to sit at the bar the service was ok it seemed the waitress was trying hard to get the food out but it being the bar it wasnt as fast as it usually is i ordered the cheese ravioli and i love cheese ravioli at restaurants and i get it its supposed to taste like cheese but this ravioli was so overwhelmingly cheesy that you couldnt really taste the sauce or anything else my husband ordered the baked ziti and while it was good weve had better the bread basket was cold and hard but the next basket was a little warmer the drinks were mixed here mine was pure vodka but its vegas right i cant complain but my husbands was a little watered down all in all it was an ok place but there is better italian food to be had this place has really good italian food for amazing prices considering its on the strip i had the crab and shrimp cannelloni which nearly brought a tear to my eye because it was so delicious the pasta was made fresh and cooked perfectly the sauce was fairly rich made from asiago and creamy and the contents of the cannelloni were superb washed it all down with a peroni on draft this may be a chain restaurant but youd never know it will definitely be coming back we love maggianos they have a great happy hour during the week and the bar area is relaxed and quiet there is an old man who looks like the six flags guy walking around playing violin and he is the coolest old little dude ever our favorites are the stuffed mushrooms spinach salad amazing dressing and the tortelluca dish everythig we have every eaten here is tasty you cant go wrong ok i love this place i wrote a review for maggianos a while ago stating that it was just ok that was a location in california but this maggianos is really good whether going in for a drink and some appetizers or ordering a full dinner you will love the variety and taste of the italian food plus it overlooks part of the strip fun my family i went to maggianos to celebrate my daughters nephews th birthday it was crowded but we were seated within minutes our server was very prompt and informative i ordered a bottle of chianti and the price was very reasonable i had the shrimp and crab cannoli and it was soo delicious everything we ordered was great we will definitely be back horrible the rudest staff and establishment i have ever dealt with i booked my reservation a few days ahead of time for pm due to las vegas traffic and a double overtime basketball game i attended our party arrived at approximately i checked in to the front desk and said hello to which i was not greeted and immediatly asked for the reservation name i provide the name and am told that due to my lateness keep in mind i am minutes late to a reservation at a restaurant they marked me as a no show and notified the yelp reservation site at this point i am already annoyed but i am on vacation and starving so i state the reason for my minutes of tardiness i continue and ask if we can get another table the greeter says i will have to wait at the end of the line for an hour to two hour wait i am still calm at this point and oblige to stand and wait a minute passes and a heavy set supervisor type asks my party to move from the desk area we move over to the corner by a coat rack another minute passes the supervisor again states to move away from the coat rack area also with my patience drawing low i move over again to another open spot in the corner after a couple minutes the supervisor again states to move away from this new spot not once does he show us another place to stand nor does he say please or thank you or anything but move rather he comes off as annoyed at the fact that we are occupying space and breathing within the reastaurant finally we have had enough and call the manager a manager type scaddadles over after about minutes and says whats wrong we tell him the situation and he coldly replies that he is busy and the we missed our reservation time also so he has no suggestion as to where to stand and wait in the restaurant we left ridiculous service by a faux italian establishment that has not the slightest idea about italian culture gratitude or hosting they are obviously solely interested in getting you in and out as fast as possible you are not a customer to them you are another number to stuff with chef boyardee noodles at a pop i have been here many times and each time i have been impressed with the restaurant and all it has to offer the food here is fantastic i highly recommend the flat breads or caesar salad for an appetizer also you are missing out if you do not order the four cheese ravioli if you come to the restaurant with a large group they have a great family style option however this option is only available for groups of four or over do not waste your caloriesmoney if your group is smaller than this it is not worth it and you will have to take food home its a national chain so if youve been to one youve been to them all but the good thing about higher end chain restaurants is that theyre consistent and in the case of maggianos theyre consistently good for the most part and a good value my wife had a gift card to their family of restaurants which included chilis and macaroni grill naturally we chose the best of the lot maggianos located in fashion show mall its a pain to find the entrance walking through the mall you have to actually walk outside of the mall towards the strip and head to the second level via the outdoor escalators to find the main entrance this was a family outing for us our three year old son in tow so we were happy to be seated at a booth theyve got a kids menu with the usual stuff pizza chicken fingers mac n cheese etc for kids get an entree beverage and a dessert lemon cookies or vanilla ice cream my kid opted for the pizza its a long rectangular crispy cheese flatbread pizza cut into triangles tasty and large enough for two kids to share the lasagna was the best item of the night a huge brick shape filled with crumbled meatballs and italian sausage and covered in meat sauce the gnocchi also came in a large portion good enough for two people while it was a little too dense it was a passable version of the dish that came with spicy italian sausage and a creamy oversauced vodka sauce they have small dessert options for the chocolate cake was decent a little too cold and firm but it hit the spot we also opted for the lemoncello pie essentially a circular key lime pie with cherries garnishing the plate and topped with whipped cream and almond slivers while not the best italian food in the city maggianos does make for a good family restaurant at a decent price considering its location stars wow is all i can say great food definitely didtinctive in their own way and yes the stuffed mushrooms are as good as everyone says they are thanks yelpers you did good on this one yes its a chain pretty much the same in all their locations but it is just so damn good psst theres a off purchase coupon available on their website we were seated at the time on our reservation and treated to very attentive service the house chianti was good bread was served soon after we were seated and waiter was kind enough to bring out some red pepper flakes and italian herbs that we could add to the olive oil the waiter explained that they were no longer doing half orders i thought i understood him to say that the menu had been redone and the portions as well as prices were now smaller no matter the lady at the next table had a rather large platter of food and i was pretty sure we werent going hungry i had linguine with shrimp garlic what i like red wine with that and my friend had the rustic chicken shrimp i love that they are not afraid to use the garlic here my shrimp were big and cooked perfectly and the sauce enhanced it beautifully without overwhelming the seafood and there were leftovers just as good for breakfast the next day for around a plate before the coupon its hard to find food this good in vegas stars because ive definitely experienced better i booked a reservation through open table i actually changed my reservation twice because my parents plans kept changing first i scheduled it at pm then i changed it to pm then finally to i got a confirmation email for each change so it was fine in my reservation i specifically stated we would greatly prefer a view seating as we are here to celebrate my mothers rd birthday did that happen nope when we arrived at i went up to the heavy set hostsupervisor who didnt even care to greet me and told him i had a reservation that i made on open table for he clicked around on his computer and said he didnt see and record of it i proceeded to login to my open table account and pull up the whole reservation on my ipod i maximized the time name and party party size and showed it to him he scrolled around on the page as if he were trying to find something thatd prove me wrong but there was nothing my reservation was right there on my phone he told me well you should really call to verify your reservations and i said oh does this happen a lot here he said no thats never happened this is the first time ive ever seen that happen as if i made everything up i tried to explain that i changed my reservation a couple times and that might be why and he said no that wouldnt be the reason so wtf is the reason then not that i care but he just stood there making it seem as if i forged a reservation on my phone or something ridiculous after a couple minutes of just telling me he doesnt see the reservation and ignoring the fact that it was on my phone he said hell try and find us a table as if it was such a huge favor they took us to the back as far away from the windows possible and sat us in some table right behind a pillar so the only view we couldve gotten was then blocked i was very upset the whole reason why i chose this place for my moms birthday is because they wanted a decently priced restaurant with a view instead we got a shitty table in the back of the room behind a pillar that we paid a total of for i couldve gotten a better ambiance at olive garden with employees x more polite and a bill half as high at least the food was good too bad my appetite was spoiled before we even sat down to make matters even worse i went home and checked my email only to find that maggianos marked me as a no show on open table how the fck did they mark me as a no show if my reservation was supposedly not there points out the window i had to contact customer service to explain that i was there and take a picture of my receipt for proof so i wouldnt have the no show on my record their response based on our diagnostics your reservation was in the restaurants electronic reservation book but for some reason this was not conveyed to you thank you for making us aware of this discrepancy hmm i wonder why that happened very upset with maggianos and that heavy set hostsupervisor man so much that i dont plan on coming back here anymore ill splurge on capital grille instead if i want that same view i got there prior to our reservation so i sat at the bar for a drink i was ignored for some time even though there were a few people behind the bar and the bar stools were half empty so they werent busy guess they dont like tips we had a very large group so they had to split us into different tables they miss counted the seats and left one out a friend grabbed a chair and added it to the table but we still had to wait for extra settings and menus it took a while to get drink orders in but water was at the tables already i got an arnold palmer with vodka it was on the weak side but tasty a friend got a coke and said it was flat bread was served with plenty to go around it was warm soft and yummy i got the italian salad it was very average the italian vinagrette was quite boring i ordered the shrimp and crab cannelloni special which i have had before it was very good lots of crab chunks and shrimp some friends got the chicken parmesean the portions are huge but they loved the food as well no one at our table had a complaint about the food most of us skipped desert roving musicians entertained us while we digested and others finished up their sweets beautiful atmosphere our waiter was great food was pretty similar to most italian restaurants around great dinner the portion was huge and i couldnt finish it our waiter was top notch and i enjoyed myself recommend reservations the food was so delicious and i love the family style dinning the stuffed mushrooms and the alfredo sauce is so amazing also the cheesecake is not too shabby either this is literally my favorite restaurant in vegas as a true italian and eating real home cooked italian food my whole life it is sometimes hard to find a place that can compare to grandmas cooking the service here is always amazing i go often it doesnt matter what you get you will enjoy it i recommend the raviolis and their house salad yuuum theres a little secret that isnt such a secret anymore after you are seated ask for the family style menu theyll bring you a totally different menu with great prices and its all family style theyll keep bringing you more and more of what you want until you ask to stop and i have tried everything on this menu and its all delicious i think the minimum you need to get family style is only three people it is well worth it i promise you gotta try this place i promise youll enjoy it went here for a quick dinner before a concert at the cosmo made reservations so we wouldnt have to wait seated immediately upon arrival and by the window at that great service april was our server and she was awesome and on top of everything will definitely eat here again when i am in vegas next dinner here was awesome the ambiance the service and most of all the food and wine just excellent portions are def well portioned for the price and the prices are a deal when it comes to portion and most of all taste the fresh bread they bring out is also a winner try not to over eat on the bread and salad though because the dish itself you need to save room for and also the desert the pasta list also gives you options for gluten free or wheat as well for those who prefer they also have a great alcohol selection and assist you in helping find a wine that best fits your meal that night definitely a great spot to eat and you can park inside of fashion show mall so there is a ton of parking my hubby took me here for dinner there was a min wait but well worth it nice place turned out to be very romantic we had a small table right but the window of the strip we had someone play a violin for us the service was great and the food was out of this world dont come to vegas and miss a meal here visited september lets make this short and sweet service very poor food average will i come back no everytime i am in las vegas i would go to maggianos everything is great and when my wife and i are there for a marathon we eat pasta i came here for the first time sept with a group of like everyone says its romantic has great views of the strip great service and the food is fantastic i had the fried calamari and eggplant parmesean and it was the best eggplant parmesean ive had so far everybody else really liked their food too although i didnt get to try it however i will be going back not to repeat what loads of others have said so heres my recap pros really good food nice ambiance and views easy to get to fashion show mall cabs can just drop you off curbside in front of the restaurant surprisingly affordable for the same cost as going to bucca or il fornaio this food kicks those places butts in my opinion the service was great super friendly wait staff and very helpful with the menu cons not really a place to bring little ones as its kind of a romantic and quiet atmosphere but im sure you could have them here wow we got lucky no wait quick service in and out in less than an hour as always excellent food boy do i love maggianos my friends and i came here on a whim while in vegas after working up appetites shopping at the mall probably not the best idea since we were squeezing into tight skirtsdresses later that evening the wait was about minutes once seated we ordered one of the family style dinners which included soup salad a few entrees and dessert way more food than we expected everything was amazing including the service somehow after all that food we all still had room for dessert we definitely ate way too much but hey we were in vegas after all the only maggianos that has awesome customer service and yummy food one of the smallest ive been to they do have rooms if you want an event done there you can only have a small wedding reception up to people no more then that its located at the fashion mall at the very end of the place they do have a outside patio it is a very romantic place with the view of the strip the food is so much better the the olive garden more authenic in youre face the food stick to youre ribs youll never leave hungry f y i this location where you order a glass of wine they put the wine in a smaller bottle you pour what you want in the wine glass but there is still some more i would say left in the small bottle you get more for youre money that way maggianos never disappoints from their soft yet crusty bread to their house salad with unbelievable dressing just the first part of the meal is incredible i highly recommend the lobster carbonara it has tons of chunks of lobster so its definitely worth the price we made reservations at and while they were unable to seat us any earlier than they were very prompt in getting us a table shortly thereafter the service was great and the view of the wynn was awesome whether youre in vegas or any other city that offers maggianos i highly recommend this place i love this place i go there when ever i am in the fashion show mall the food is always awesome really good service nice atmosphere i travel a lot and truly think this place is delicious i love this restaurant casual elegant and everything on the menu is fantastic we bring friends here when theyre in town and always remind them to save room for dessert the service is always great too love this place and highly recommend it you know the lens crafters slogan ready in about an hour i was waiting at the mercy of the glasses gods not really in the mood to shop so i decided to talk a stroll to the other end of the mall for a glass of wine i considered each of the different restaurant options but with the main goal in mind wine i opted for maggianos the rest of the mall was sparse but you would never guess it was a tuesday night upon entering the joint was hopping i found a vacant seat at the bar and grabbed their wine list i usually start with a white but my mood was askew due to the onset of cool weather and early sunset after a brief study i requested a glass of meiomi pinot noir score now what to do with my hands while i sit here but of course an appetizer all of my friends can attest that ive been on a calamari quest of late not surprising i opt for the calamari while im kicking back sipping my savory cherry berry juice the fellow next to me a tourist from connecticut strikes up a lively conversation i discover he works for the travel channel has an exact opposite wine palate from me and we were both at the same event last saturday the lees th annual wine experience perfecto little golden rings cooked to lightly crunchy perfection arrive pair them with maggianos famous marinara that suggests nuances of garlic onion and basil and im one happy camper who forgot she was waiting on anything the lens crafters notification call comes and goes but im not ready to leave just yet so i order up another glass of wine this time i order up a cline ancient vines zin which isnt bad at all my wife and i like the ambiance of this place its really nice to eat outside on the balcony they have decent wines the food is pretty good healthy portions and friendly staff i recommend this place we eat here every time in vegas it very consistent it is very good for large groups as it serves the traditional large sizes service is always good food is always good my noodles were a little over cooked this time so i knocked them down to a star otherwise they are star all the way second time here and first time to review a friend of ours made dinner reservations for sat evening by the window and within mins of arrival we were seated right above the strip facing the wynn my recommendation is to bring friends so you can order the family style meal on the back of the menu there are three price points and we chose the pp you choose and everyone shares salads appetizers pasta dishes entrees and deserts and if you want more just ask it is ayce my rating is for the family style experience first time visit great view of strip at table wonderful atmosphere great food good prices great service my in laws love this place so we went for dinner with a group of with their chase rewards first of all make sure you make your reservations really far in advance they made them a couple weeks ahead of time on a weekend and there still was only a or reso if you make a reservation for a large group of people they make you wait for everyone to get there to sit down this was annoying because the last two in our party were late and we were getting hungry the ambiance was really cool the lighting is nice for a large group or a date their service was ok the server poured the rest of our bottle of wine and then didnt ask us if we wanted another bottle we werent finished with our meal so i thought that wasnt very smart of him more more tip the food was pretty good for a corporate place very corporate like a buca di beppo or a macaroni grill but a little bit better i give it a instead of a because i feel it wasnt just ok the atmosphere and the singer guy with an accordion player accompaniment really stepped up the review from a to a star a solid stars this place was pretty damn good i know its a chain and i would have thought i would have been to one by now considering they are all over the place in the dmv area surprisingly so i had not and my first visit to a maggianos little italy in las vegas was a pleasant one when i arrived they had to tap a keg for a newcastle that i wanted this was sort of annoying because it felt like forever but i was watching football and gambling on it at the time our waitress was a real sweetheart and she checked on us regularly i had a few beers before my meal and they didnt seem to mind the ambiance was really cool but i could have told it was a chain type restaurant even if i didnt know the food was great they brought out bread before the meal and we werent very hungry so i didnt order an appetizer i had the center cut filet mignon and the person i was with had the salmon salad we were both very pleased with the overall meal i was very pleased with this chain restaurant and would go back again long line so i expected something spectacular it was just average italian food with a high price delicious just wish there was one off the strip terrible customer service we called a month in advance to make thanksgiving reservations we flew in from philly and flew my brother in for his birthday from l a when we got to vegas we called to move the reservation an hour and a half later no problem the girl told us and she confirmed they knew we were celebrating a birthday and thanksgiving we arrived only to learn they had closed at one hour before we were supposed to be there i confirmed the time i had called and they confirmed that a note was in our reservation nevertheless although the restaurant was packed they refused to seat us they offered a weak apology not even a free drink and our thanksgiving was ruined terrible terrible customer service first let me say i really enjoy the food and atmosphere at maggianos we go there often but unfortunately i cant say the same for their thanksgiving dinner menu we made reservations for pm a month ago at their las vegas location and they did not seat us until pm i was not happy but really try to make the best of this special day waiter was overworked came to our table maybe three times i felt like the whole thing was a big rush did not enjoy at all could have stayed home cooked and saved the money we spent i will go back but not on any major holidays oh yeah last but not least the food was mediocre i know i cant believe it the best part of that night was leaving that comment was from my yo son lol well we come here a couple of times a year when we are in vegas tonight we had an excellent server frank hes a tall new yawk boy we had several requests throughout the meal which were all attended to promptly and with a genuine smile we really enjoyed the excellent service and sunny disposition ive been to maggianos before and didnt think that much of it however vegas maggianos may be your what should we eat dinner place i thought it was so worth it paying like for pasta rather than paying the same amount for pho plus it feels like you can just sit down and chill the food is typical italian chain so you cant go wrong we went here the past tuesday for lunch and i got what i normally order since i am not a fan of pasta the salmon entree with spinach and potatoes the last time i had this was probably last year when my food arrived i was surprised to find that my potatoes were on a small plate while the nicely cooked salmon placed on top of bed of spinach topped with capers and lemon and herb butter was on another the salmon was as good as i remembered but the potatoes werent the same better they used to come on the same plate as the salmon and was plain roasted nothing unique but now they are nice and crisp and wow it adds a different texture as an accompaniment to my fish and i am loving this entree more than ever before i usually only finish half of this entree but this time around i finished the entire meal and yes i was happily full additionally our waitress provided our party with exceptional service her service is comparable to that of a waitress at joel robuchon i know bold statement but she is that wonderful ive been sick for the last week and was soooo sick of liquids and soups that i wanted something hearty i always somehow or another crave pasta always so decided to have lunch here and get some nordstrom shopping done other than pasta i had been craving fish luckily the waitress sealed the deal on my dish when she said i could substitute my potatoes with pasta so i got the grilled salmon with lemon and thyme sauteed spinach with pasta and garlic and olive oil it was sooooo good exactly what i had been craving fresh and light tasting fish with my pasta fix friend had their famous rigatoni d which is pretty delicious rigatoni and penne pasta have to be my favorite kinds of pasta prolly because i hate having to slurp up the long stringy pastas and mushrooms and onions added to the ringatoni always make for deliciousness and a happy laurie with it being cold lately it was nice to end the lunch with some tea i think i had some apricot or peach tea and friends had the peppermint tea great that they had big tea collection the service was prolly the best ive ever had there had to tip the waitress well just based on her refilling my waters like crazy that day kept having to tell her that i was really thristy and sorry for always coming back for refills before going to a show we decided to get a bite to eat at maggianos though i should say many bites as the portions at maggianos are huge i ordered the rustic chicken and shrimp al forno with a caesars salad it was really good in fact my mom and her friend liked it so much they wished they had ordered it the only bad part was i had to go out of town the next day so i wasnt able to keep the leftovers it worked out great for my moms friend though who offered to take the leftovers place was packed on a sunday night we opted to sit at a high top in the bar area unfortunately we were just inside the door and every time somebody went in or out we got blasted with a strong cold wind service was friendly but pretty slow the salads were huge and delicious the chicken piccata was rather odd the pasta was served in its own bowl on the side i did my best to mix it with the chicken had dinner last night with the family and im giving them stars for the service and the food the wait is rather long thats why i gave it and the food is a little pricey our server was very attentive and always smiling whenever she comes to our table making sure that we have what we need i ordered the lobster carbonara it was very good with lots of lobster meat its mostly from the claw they have big portions so my daughter my husband and i have to bring home half of our food i will go back to this restaurant because of the food and service always a great choice for italian and surprisingly for being on the strip they have the best prices in town im never disappointed when i come here the food is fantastic the service is great and the ambiance is grand with views of the strip throughout most of the restaurant i recommend this place with two thumbs up weve always liked our normally pretty flawless dining experiences here but on this particular occasion when of course i was introducing the restaurant to two friends the wheels of service largely came off the tracks we had reserved a booth that overlooked picture windows facing strip hotels across the street but it wasnt ready when we arrived we had to wait about minutes for a booth to be cleared which was no big deal but it established a pattern of service being at least two beats behind all night for starters i ordered calamari fritte and crab shrimp imperial a special of the day i also ordered a cup of tuscan sausage orzo soup and a side of caesar salad before my entree of linguine clams bread arrived first which was good and crusty but our iced teas and soft drinks were not brought forth until minutes after the presentation of bread evo and butter and one soft drink was missing so were two of four bread plates and a knife soon afterward the appetizers arrived unfortunately so did both my soup and salad four items were plopped on the table at the same time all of them mine although jammed up with food i did my best to race through the appetizers before my soup got cold and largely succeeded by taking half of each appetizer home the crab shrimp imperial consisting of crab stuffed lobster with herb bread crumbs and lobster cream sauce over orzo pasta was simply excellent it was also very filling the deep fried calamari was uncharacteristically undercooked but still fairly tasty especially dipped in the lemon aioli that was prepared on request the accompanying marinara sauce was also good and mellow as before the tuscan sausage orzo soup did not disappoint the fennel flavored soup packed an unusual but welcome taste of mild sausage fresh tomatoes celery and white beans the side of caesar salad was a generous helping of cool and crisp romaine greens with focaccia croutons and grated parmesan cheese linguine clams with invisible but tasty white clam sauce was a nice pasta dish that boasted both fresh and chopped clams but unfortunately only fresh clams were present which not only seemed meager but were far less than i had enjoyed on a previous occasion and i bit down on a small piece of clam shell that was included in the mix garlic bread focaccia was not very garlicky at all and inexplicably the cheesy fontina potatoes that my wife had ordered did not arrive at our table until minutes beyond the third of three promises of minutes longer by our server just after our packaged leftovers had been handed to us obviously we didnt want additional starch any more at a point when we were about to leave the premises after an apology by our server that seemed sincere the still steaming potatoes were packaged in a baking tin and presented to us again without charge the quality of ingredients and tastiness of what i ate were mostly sound as always and kudos and an extra star to restaurant management for calling to report that my missing kindle had been found on the floor of our booth before i raced back to retrieve it right after midnight so stars on an off night excellent food and atmosphere tourists if you have leftover food take it with u and walk to the nearest pedestrian bridge and give it to one of the many homeless there i had dinner here with three co workers last wednesday night the ambiance was nice and the wait staff very friendly and efficient we ordered the family style dining option and the appetizers were excellent we have the mozzarella marinara spinach artichoke al forno garlic bread focaccia and italian tossed salad for dinner we ordered gnocchi italian sausage four cheese ravioli baked rigatoni pomodoro and braised beef ravioli the main dishes were overly sauced and the pasta was over cooked i could not even eat the gnocchi it was like eating balls of paste this restaurant is highly rated by many on yelp so it is possible we were just there on a bad night but i will find it hard to return after my last experience i dont think that anyone in my group was terribly impressed great place great food we hosted our wedding reception at maggianos las vegas it was the perfect place for our wedding reception cassy was extremely helpful and always responded to my emails in a timely fashion i also appreciated how she genuinely cared that i was getting the most for my money she made great suggestions about how to spend the money toward our room minimum the workers at maggianos did a fantastic job setting up our reception it looked even better than i had imagined it would there was so much food and it was all delicious my guests all loved the food and some said it was the best food they had ever had at a wedding this venue is a one stop shop they referred me to a great dj bakery florist and limo service too thank you so much to everyone at maggianos first time at maggianos and ill definitely be back i had the skirt steak with green peppercorns for lunch and it was great fries needed some work hence the server was very sweet and attentive i will definitely be back so my bf and i decided to eat here while we were at the fashion show mall he kept raving to me how good it was so i wanted to try it and he was right it is absolutely delicious its fine dining so of course service was great as well we stopped here at the last minute managed to get a table quickly on a busy night best to get a reservation if you want to go pricing is better than most the food was wonderful everything we ordered including the dessert was at least a rating the service was excellent friendly and just the right amount of attention without hovering the view of the strip and the wynn is a nice taste of las vegas the roving musicians i can take or leave its a bit coercive when you are asked if you want a song for your lady in front of her and knowing that they expect payment i havent been to maggianos for about years but it still has the same solid food this location is inside the fashion show mall they only serve the dinner menu no lunch specials we came for a light lunch at the bar at pm maggianos actually fit the bill because we shared the following a italian toss side salad and an order of spaghetti meatballs hubby had beer on draft which came in a tall but skinnier than usual glass italian toss side salad we opted for the side salad portion simply because we didnt want leftovers romaine lettuce arugula red onions tomatoes croutons peppercinis with a light viniagrette dressing spaghetti meatballs rather meatball no s it was a big meatball though spaghetti was a smaller portion than expected however it was perfect for our purposes i love to add red pepper flakes in my pasta the lady working the bar area did a great job taking orders serving etc standard maggianos fare which is always a good meal for the service and drinks seemed sharper in vegas than atlanta where i usually go i came here a couple months ago during my vacation in las vegas i was skeptical to try maggianos out since they were a chain restaurant but i would be pleasantly surprised unfortunately no locations in canada where im from yet this maggianos is located in the fashion show mall next to wynn and encore hotels maggianos isnt exactly fine dining but it does have a pretty nice ambiance for a family style restaurant it has full panoramic glass windows around the perimeter of the dining room showcasing an awesome view of the wynn hotel and that part of the strip while we were there two violinists went around the restaurant playing songs for each table and to top it off our server was so kind and helpful the menu here is also pretty interesting and worth a mention along side the regular a la cart menu they also have a family style menu basically you choose several items from a predetermined set and for a fixed price per pereson you can order as much of any item you want its kind of like all you can eat but for only the few items you choose we ended up going for this option and ordered the light family dinner that comes with bottomless portions for appetizers salads and pastas maggianos salad this salad is literally the best salad ive ever had the signature house dressing was a spicy sweet vinaigrette and paired with the crunchy prosciutto bits i could not for the life of me stop eating this crispy zucchini fritte the waiter said this was their most popular appetizer and i can see why the zucchinis are deep fried in a crumbly crunchy batter and were irresistible with the cool ranch dip linguine and clams with white clam sauce i did not like this at all the sauce was runny and tasted like fishy sea water it was way too salty our famous rigatoni d guess they dont call it famous for nothing this pasta is really really good the pasta is cooked perfectly al dente and is served with lots of mushrooms and creamy marsala sauce for a chain this place really isnt bad youll leave for the most part happy and full ok i am not a connoisseur of italian eateries but i have been to enough italian restaurants in my time to give a solid review first my friends and i made reservations for pm on a saturday evening days in advance we get to the restaurant at pm and the hostess gave us the pager gadget and says it will be a few minutes half an hour later we still have not been seated yet i wonder why we even bothered to make reservations in my book you make a reservation for a certain time and when that time comes you get seated that is the point of making a reservation and the basic meaning of the word this is a big no no in my book that is either poor planning or mismanagement or both if i am gonna spend some bills in a fancier style restaurant i expect to be taken care of that is what i am paying for and have no problem doing so the silver lining if there is one is that we werent the only ones there were numerous folks there having the same frustrations and issues with this topic and wishing to speak to the manager not a good sign the waitress was nice enough and adequate though the only issue i had with her is that we got our vinegar and oil for our bread but guess what no bread only after minutes and asking did we receive our bread again not what i expect from a purported higher class establishment the food was adequate but not what i would call earth shattering the calamari was tasty and the rigatoni d was tasty and sauce was good i have had better and worse my friends all liked what they got from what they told me overall mediocre experience at best one thing i have learned over the years is that you can tell a lot about a place by the way they keep the bathrooms and i must say that was horrible and maybe the worst i have ever seen except for a few roadside gas stations in my days it was an absolute mess with dirty paper towels water all over the floor and overall condition to be filthy again i hope they dont keep the kitchen like the do the restroom i dont even want to think about that overall not a horrible experience but not one for the books either in my opinion carrabas easily matches and super cedes maggianos overall for a much better eating experience and price oh almost forgot i will give a or on the overall ambiance and feel of the restaurant it was a comfortable and luxurious setting and decorated nicely but unfortunately the wrapping on the package was much better than the gift inside the ambiance was my favorite part we made reservations around pm on saturday the earliest seating was at pm we arrived at the fashion show mall parked and wondered our way out front to the entrance of maggianos i always love the atmosphere in these kind of places im not a big fan of italian food so dont read too much into my comments about the food the calamari fritte was a bit greasy with too much oil but was overall pretty good the marinara dipping sauce was superb we also had stuffed mushrooms which were really good they were stuffed with spinach and topped with seasoned bread crumbs and served in a garlic white wine sauce my fiance and i shared a bowl of linguine di mare it had lobster shrimp clams mussels with noodles in a spicy lobster tomato broth it was pretty good lots of meat very filling a man with a guitar and another man with an accordion serenaded us with a romantic italian song simply romantic we had nice seats facing las vegas boulevard we lingered a while after paying the bill but the server stopped refilling our water this bothered me a little i was unusually thirsty and could not seem to get enough the bill was almost we had to take an alternate route back to the car because the fashion show mall was closed i enjoyed this experience and would go again but would prefer some place else because im not a big fan of italian food ive heard about maggianos for awhile and finally got the chance to eat at one of their restaurants when i was in vegas for business since there were of us we decided to order family style a head and we choose two appetizers two salads two pastas two entrees and two desserts all you can eat we ordered the calamari and mussels chopped and italian salad spaghetti and meatballs and linguine with clams white sauce the chicken marsala and tilapia and the tiramisu and smores special dessert calamari was great but i was a little disappointed in the mussels too many white beans in the mix for me the salads were good linguine was good and the meatballs on the spaghetti were huge the tilapia wasnt too fishy and was nice and moist and we loved the chicken marsala both desserts were great as well big points for our waiter noel as well he was very helpful professional and attentive through our stay he encouraged us to eat more and even gave us many containers to take home our leftovers in the spaghetti and chicken marsala were still great the next day as well as the desserts when it comes to vegas restaurants this would not have been my first choice there is one near my house and i prefer to eat at places i have never been while i am on vacation but it was my friends birthday dinner we had a party of so we had to order off the family style menu we looked at the menu in advance so we already knew what we would be getting when we got there we ordered the fried mozzarella and stuffed mushrooms to start for entrees we ordered a lobster carbonara chicken parmesan beef medallions and a bow tie pasta we thought we would get one plate of each but they brought of each one for each end of the table we where well fed dessert was my favorite house made terramissu and apple cobbler wonderful our server was wonderful too she was very friendly and attentive our drinks never ran dry it was a great experience maggianos is must go and enjoy great ambiance the service was attentive and the food was delicious family style is the way to go if at all possible when visiting here doing this for lunch however does have its down side you will have left overs be prepared to take something home and enjoy it the next day the place is huge and though i am sure it gets crowded we were able to be seated outside in great weather without reservations on a sunday slightly earlier than the lunch hour in march i just love maggianos not usually a fan of big chains but i just love them i have one close to where i live and ate there only because we had been given a gift certificate while in vegas with my family i insisted we have a big family meal at maggianos we made reservations for on a tuesday night we arrived on time but had to wait more than thirty minutes to be seated the place was totally packed so we had to stand smashed together in the bar area while we waited that sucked and made me wonder why we bothered with reservations our server was extremely busy there was an top in our section but he did a fantastic job considering how busy he was and how many questions and picky orders my family came up with the food was fantastic i ordered the spinach artichoke appetizer and the eggplant parmesan everyone at the table absolutely loved the spinach artichoke however we prefered it on the table bread as opposed to the crostini its served with the little pieces of crostini are too small and too hard for the yummilicious creamy piping hot rich spinach artichoke dip my eggplant parm was beautiful and delicious unfortunately in total vegas style it was enormous a small family could have shared it i have a big family haha it was just perfect im not used to whole pieces of roasted garlic in my eggplant parm but they were delightful little treats to discover here and there it couldnt have been better honestly four meals came out of it the one that night a midnight snack later my meal on the plane the next day and my husbands lunch the next day it was even delicious cold for desert my sister ordered the desert platter it had tiramisu cheesecake chocolate cake apple pie ala mode and i cant remember the last one it was so pretty and only the whole table shared it and we still had leftovers im not a fan of sweets so i only nibbled a couple things my sister said it was the best cheesecake shed ever had all in all it was a fantastic night i remember sitting back for a moment looking around the table everyone was laughing eating and having a wonderful time the food here is always plentiful tasty and the service always sublime if i had to pick a chain of italian its definitely maggianos i come to this restaurant every time im in las vegas the evening i went it was crowded and the waiter seemed stressed even though we had reservations they still made us wait min they seem to do this every time i come here the view is fabulous the food was perfect it was my birthday so they brought me cookies the only complaint i have is the restrooms were filthy both men and womens when we arrived at vegas it was late night we just want to have something simply not too oily or heavy and then we found this italian restaurant within minutes walk from trump the environment is lovely there is a violinist playing beautiful songs from table to table the food were fabulous we had crab cake for appetizer the crab was fresh and delicious i had sauteed shrimps with risotto and it was fantastic the rice was creamy but not to soft shrimp was cooked just enough my friend has salmon with pasta it looked nice too the atmosphere is alright and the food is good nothing special but the service is exceptionally terrible i stopped giving it another try because i just couldnt take it anymore it amazes me that a place can consistently have bad service in las vegas no thank you love it food was delicious im giving it a because i have had some very good meals there but today i had their shrimp risoto special and it was pretty terrible not inedible but not up to their normal quality i know risoto can be a tough dish but if you cant make it well maybe you should just stay away from it my wife and i along with our couple friends stopped by maggianos as we were walking down the strip we ordered the tomato caprese for an appetizer that was very tasty the dishes are massive in portion and the food is delicious ordered the mozzarella and it was delicious had the new york strip steak and the veal porterhouse and split both of them the ny strip and the veal porterhouse was absolutely wonderful it was perfectly grilled and tender remember they serve nice big portions so please share them they always have sinatra playing in the background two people were roaming playing songs for you our server was really good this was our first time eating at maggianos celebrating a friends birthday the food was amazing their italian food is legit not your olive garden style variety the portions are huge ordering family style was the way to go bring an appetite youre going to need it yes maggianos is a chain restaurant that can be found in most us states yes its just typical hearty italian dishes yes it gets pretty packed here at this particular one and yes i had a pretty awesome experience here even though i would have preferred to dine at a michelin starred or famous celebrity chefs restaurant here in lv i joined some of my old colleagues from my previous job here for dinner during the interop convention we had a driver take us from our hotel to this restaurant so there was obviously no parking problem we had a table reserved for about of us and we were seated promptly the place was jampacked for a weeknight but everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their meals and their service it can definitely get pretty damn loud here we ordered tons of different pasta chicken seafood and dessert dishes everything served family style of course everything that came out tasted wonderful i honestly didnt wanna look like a mcfatty pig in front of some of the executives i was dining with so i kept my portions on my plate pretty small but when dessert came out i opted to eat my full slice of cheesecake all to myself and of course nibble on some of the other dessert plates that were still sitting there in the middle of our table our waiterwaitresses were all very friendly and service was quite efficient would i dine at this particular maggianos again hmmm well i have about a million bookmarked spots to try out so i probably wont be coming back here anytime soon just due to the fact that i already know its standard italian food but i would definitely recommend this place to anyone whos not that adventurous with other types of food and just want to enjoy their night with a hearty dinner at a well known chain restaurant i clearly have a different opinion of this place compared to other reviews this was my second visit here the first being a few years ago i do not even know where to begin the place is wall to wall people so crammed on top of one another it is so loud you cannot hear what the other people at your table are saying the tables are not big enough for the amount of people they seat at them we were people squished in a table which was meant for our server may have been new so i will try to cut him some slack but he did get alot of our order wrong our drinks were mixed up it took forever to get our appetizers the entrees came pretty quickly but one was wrong the dessert was the worst part my sister brought in a cake for my nephews birthday and it took nearly an hour before it arrived by this point we asked that it be put back in the box to take home the food was not good there are so many better options for italian food real italian food to me this is on the same level of olive garden the one shining star of the meal was the spinach and artichoke dip it was one of the best i have ever had save your money go elsewhere where you can have a great meal and a nice conversation i for one will never go back we had out of town friends who took us there gads how i wish we had visited this place on our own the grub is great the prices are great the service is great the out of town guests were great as usual my wife continues to be great this place is really worth a visit i would give it stars any other time i would give this place stars because this place and the bay area ca one is amazing and have never had a negative moment but when i went this evening the inside host was absolutely pure rudeness first we went in with a reservation why one makes reservations here you still got to wait we were early so that worked out because we got in just about right after our reservation time when we walked in we were welcomed by host the girl on the right when you walk in took our name and we asked her if we could sit outside she rudely walkie her outside host and told us no seats available we took our page and as we did i assured with her we would be seated outside she said yes just wait until its our actual reservation our buzzer page and we came inside to thesame host and she told us to step to the side and wait to be seated i said well be seated outside right host no you never said anything about wanting to be outside if you wanted to sit outside all you had to do was ask the outside host and be seated out there here i bit my tongue from yelling or getting loud and i informed he that she never said any of that and that i had mentioned more than twice that we wanted to sit outside and recalled for her how she even called out to the outside host the host stated oh that wasnt me you must have talked to someone else so lets just say this went on for a few minutes i was very upset we had to walk ourselves outside and talk to the outside host ourselves to be seated our waiter miguel took our mind off it made us laugh and was so good spirited he also can carry a couple arm full of dishes food is good it was my first time there and i have to say that i love the atmosphere it is very open yet intimate our server was awesome and the food is amazing the only complaint i have is the tiramisu was well below average i normally wouldve given maggianos a star rating but they earned an extra star for dealing with our pain in the ass party long story short of my closest girlfriends and i visited vegas we made the reservation then made our choices for appetizer salad entree and dessert we showed up minutes late on a saturday night i was having panic attacks the entire way to the restaurant because i work in a busy restaurant and i know the repercussions of being almost an hour late with a party of on a saturday night they were very patient and we had an amazing private room it was in a wine closet so fun our waiter was awesome the food was okay typical italian upscale chain fare after walking for what seemed hoursand probably was my family and i decided to eat here its conveniently located in the fashion show mall so after a days shopping and gambling at the nearby venetian and palazzo some italian food sounded good we went around pm so it was not crowded at all we were immediately seated and service was prompt the appetizer we chose which was stuffed mushrooms was quite delicious and i would order these again my dish was a shrimp risotto which wasnt a part of the regular menu but a special they had i thought it was good but it didnt wow me i probably wouldnt order it again my mom had a beef tenderloin dish and because she invariably cannot finish her meal she offered some to me i found the beef to be very good and in fact wished i had ordered that instead my brother ordered a lobster carbonara dish which he was disappointed with because they mistakenly did not put bacon in the dish even though it is listed and most carbonaras should have it i got a bite of the lobster in it and thought it was okay overall the meal was good and i would probably eat here again but would try another dish the prices here are not too bad about for three of us including appetizer and drinks great dinner great prices for southern italian food excellent service from our server love love love maggianos the service is always fantastic the food is even better and the drinks never disappoint the patio has a nice little view of the wynn and the strip maggianos never disappoints we made reservations for maggianos through yelp and it was so fast and easy i would highly recommend making reservations through yelp if it has the option i believe it was linked to foursquare not sure though we took my mom out for a late mothers day dinner it wasnt crowded which was great though it got a bit crowded after pm while we waited for my mom to arrive we sat at the bar my husband got a beer and he got a little surprise the glass in which the bartender poured the beer had a lipstick mark it was gross he told the bartender and looked at it in shock he gladly switched it out we went with the family style classic option which includes appetizers salads and desserts entrees we got the calamari and zucchini for appetizer the ceasar and spinach salad the chicken parm grilled salmon spaghetti w meatballs and gnocchi w italian sausage spumoni ice cream and tiramisu for dessert my favorite was the calamari cesar salad chicken parm and desserts everything else is okay i didnt care to much for the salmon though the portions were huge had to take a lot of it home i didnt understand how they just put the ice cream in a warm bowl by the time we got it it was melted maybe they should put it in an ice bowl the waiter was nice and service was quick view is nice oversees the wynn properties there is also a man that walks around in his violin to play music for you which i believe you have to tip him its a good place to eat if there is a big group of you and craving italian food after extremely abusive service at maggianos tonight im calling it quits the food was burned and the server was so rude that we didnt feel comfortable with the scene that we thought complaining would have caused it went sort of comical at first but the longer the service continued for the more abusive it got until it was downright hostile at the end it all started with drinks we ordered at the bar the hostesses told us it would be a minute wait so we ordered there our table was ready in so we settled up at the bar the bartender was incredibly nice btw and took he drinks to our seat the waitress was clearly agitated that we already had drinks and said she didnt bring us bread because we might have just gotten that at the bar too you only get bread with dinner so that was a very clear dig my girlfriend said are we being punished for having drinks already when the waitress left the table and it was obvious we were she paid attention to the tables around us and didnt even make eye contact with us she finally asked about the food hallways through our meal by saying its good right while looking at the plate of burned cannelloni that was sitting mostly uneaten im posting pictures when a server asked a question like that as brusquely as she did she sint looking for the truth so i kept my mouth closed while my girlfriend said her dinner was fine she asked us if we wanted desert or more drinks and when we said no she plopped down our dirty plates back down at the edge of the table and stormed off to get our check she dropped it at the table and that was the last we saw of her we talked it over while trying to make change between the two of us and left her a tip i dont believe in less than typically we left the bartender but she was so rude i think that i should have left nothing i used to take people here all the time and it was recommended in my las vegas list because the atmosphere was nice the view is great and the food was reliable lately none of that has been true and im done trying to weather out a bad time at maggianos ive been to this location times in the last year im the duke of checkins here on yelp but tonight will probably be the last disinterested service i can overlook and even incapable service is something ill suffer through for decent food or the right occasion ive learned my lesson tonight though there are too many better places that are only a stones throw away pretty dreadful service one afternoon recently for lunch i really hate when servers decide whether to give good service to tables on whether they think the customers will leave a good tip our water glasses sat empty for over a half hour while our waiter filled other tables glasses and avoided eye contact with us he delivered our salads and then extremely awkwardly reached over us to get the remaining place settings i understand that might be a corporate policy but why would you set food down ask if you can get anything else usually a good indicator it is okay to start eating and then reach over your guests wrong order of things weird waiter that was the last time he visited our table before we were finished leaving our salad bowls for our enjoyment i also had a discount that said nothing about not being valid on weekends but they would not honor it the other staff was not super friendly either so i did not feel that complaining would elicit a response this was a one star experience overall but the food is truly amazing here that i have to give them two they also had the large lunch menu displayed outside the restaurant when they were not serving their lunch menu on weekends what a weird day at maggianos great service family friendly try the chicken marsala its off the chain my lil ones were getting cranky waiting for food so they brought out snacks for them outdoor dining great for people watching came here for an early dinner around pm we got seated within minutes drinks and appetizers came quick we got the margherita flatbread was good stuffed mushrooms eh was not good the entrees were huge but took minutes after appetizers to come out at this point we were full and packed most of it to go baked rigatoni really salty and i didnt like the paprika in my pasta shrimp fettecini alfredo nothing special linguine and clams was decent the service was average i would come back and get outdoor seating and just order appetizers and drinks im still looking for a good italian place in vegas first the good part waiter and manager were very receptive and friendly and tried their best to help also decor and space is fine clean and open what you expect from an upscale chain the bad part the salads we ordered looked like a pre made salad that you can buy in a bag at the supermarket the first time it came out there were wilted pieces and they forgot to add the chicken they were very apologetic and brought out new salads this time they came out without wilted leaves but still the produce was as dry and brittle as the first time the chicken was also overcooked dry maybe i wouldnt mind so much if it wasnt a salad i didnt expect anything fancy but i do want carefully prepared and fresh food we then wondered if maybe it wasnt the fault of the restaurant but of their food suppliers the cost of being a chain restaurant but then we went across to the street to the wynn and had a delicious vibrant salad so though i appreciate maggianos eager and friendly service and pleasant decor i think they would do better to focus on the quality of their food maggianos is well umm i guess just another chain restaurant in the brinker international group alongside chilis the food here always tastes good though and its way more nice than a chilis trust me i used to work at a chilis tt i really enjoyed the violinist that walked around the room playing guests favorite song i share the shrimp scampi and it was okay nothing too stunning or extraordinary in my senses good service clean tables tidy restrooms and prompt service overrated ugh i have eaten at maggianos a couple of times and i have never had a good experience it was the same story both times they tend to serve customers based on who looks like theyre ballers i guess that means i dont look like im not balling out of control because i always have to practically beg for a drink refill it makes me wonder what it is that makes them classify people that way i was dressed in nice business attire so did i look like a redneck or something was it because i was young either way the maggianos staff needs to wise up you never know who someone is and how well they will tip by appearances alone just sayin the food isnt that great either during both visits my fiance and i ended up with pathetic salads burned or under seasoned entrees and virtually no service whatsoever both times something had to be sent back because it was either made incorrectly or was disgusting pathetic get it together is there something im just not getting that makes this place so special as far as i have seen the elitist attitude from the servers amounts to jack squat they cant deliver on any front food or service this is another scenario where i really feel like youre paying for ambiance and as i always say i cant eat ambiance i know maybe i should go be a baller at the local mcdonalds i could order the entire dollar menu and i guarantee the food would be better than maggianos we had high expectations based on the reviews but were very disappointed calamari was extremely salty and overcooked dark brown lasagna was cold in the middle seafood was strong flavored suggesting it was fresh paste was overcooked and mushy bread was stale price was way out of range from quality for two people i really enjoy the food here i ordered to take out because i didnt wanna eat by myself and look all weird at an upscale restaurant thats just no service on the take out was quick simple and easy by the time i got to the cashier the man was already there it was a big guy and had a healthy complexion i was going to receive change but i told the guy to keep it since he was there ready for me italian food vs italian food way better than olive gardens old bland food ill check them out again though since they did try to change for the better times better i only got one dish just to try and check the food out chicken spinach manicotti full of flavor chicken had a natural chicken flavor with slight seasoning the spinach wasnt overbearing and just helped compliment the dish texture had a slight crisp and softness to it which had a really fine balance it was superb in my opinion not too salty or dry the ricotta cheese and alfredo sauce blends in perfectly although the ricotta was just a tad on the stronger side ill definitely be coming back we had a great dinner and drinks the food tasted great its like every other maggianos but its on the strip in the fashion show mall which means its beyond busy piece of advice make a reservation unless youd like to sit at the bar but even then it might take them forever and a day to get to you even though it was busy are service was efficient fast probably wont be coming back to this location since we were in vegas just for the weekend plus it was way too crowded for my liking on the plus complimentary bread splitting meals isnt a big deal we ate here with a party of the service was great the food was good we ordered baked sausage ziti ravioli lasagna and pork chops it was also a walk away from ti they also have a great happy hour for cocktails i would return to this place for sure the best italian food i have ever had from a chain restaurant if you are staying in vegas get out of your hotel and take a walk to maggianos you will need the walk back to your hotel to help digest the fantastic meal you just ate i have eaten at maggianos a number of times around the country and now i find myself seeking them out when i travel if you like calamari you must try theirs i think my favorite dish so far is moms lasagna be sure to save room for the tiramisu or pound cake with caramelized bananas they also have a very good wine list maggianos is one of several restaurants in the fashion show mall definitely better than venturing into the food court if you have the time went here on a saturday evening they were busy still my waitress was prompt and courteous the outdoor patio is wonderful option the food is yummy with great menu options not nearly as good as all the other maggianos but ok for the area great italian food very nice location good white table cloth restaurant with reasonable prices friendly staff i have used maggianos for meeting functions for over years this location is in need of understanding customer service i miss the excellent service received from dallas austin san antonio and houston locations i wont use this location anymore for my meetings when held in las vegas i dont think that any of the banquet staff have ever attended a meeting to know what needs and expectations are needed to fulfill a successful event i wish them the best i am moving on we had lunch here on our first day in vegas the food was excellent the service was fast and courteous and the atmosphere was really nice nothing was outrageous expensive and although we went there during the day the view of the wynn and that end of the strip was nice i was told that this is a chain but we dont have any in massachusetts and i never would have guessed definitely a great option for italian if you are in town this food was very good the bread they give is yummy dont eat to much of it youll get full the fettuccine alfredo was good the chicken was very tender except i seen a picture here on yelp and my alfredo had no broccoli my boyfriend had the chicken saltimbocca which he said was really good all together it was wonderful good services and not to expensive i am very happy with maggianos i had been there before and knew i would love the food but sometimes restaurants will let you down when they have to fulfill an order larger than say not so here my party was about people and the food and service was top notch from the catering managers to the actual staff the day of everyone was professional accommodating and very warm and friendly i honestly cannot complain about a single thing everything i hoped for and expected was fulfilled if not exceeded you should definitely consider maggianos for a wedding reception or weddingrehearsal dinner you will not be let down i came here for my birthday last month and i had the most amazing experience the food is great and the service is amazing everyone was very friendly and attentive and the food is delicious the enviornment is great too and they have this guy singing at the tables he is a really good singer and very friendly i really like the idea of having him entratain the people in the restaurant i cant wait to go back to vegas just to go to this place again i would give this place stars but our waiter every time he poured me water he spilled it only mine first time was a big ass spill next one went on my bread third one went on my meal come on maaayynn but the food was bomb diggity went to maggianos for me and other friends birthday dinner with everyone they have a nice little family meal which is a ridiculous amount of food but its all you can eat doesnt really explain much but if you have a big group i would suggest that you get that although we didnt order it lol service was pretty good we got some toasty warm bread yum and their butter is so yums i ended up ordering the chicken spinach manicotti sooo creamy so deliiicious comes in decent sized pieces and i just wanted to savor every bite its really quiet in there none of the other customers talk so for the most part my friends and i were the entertainment of the night we were seated in the back right corner so we are able to see the other hotels and what not all of a sudden we see cop cars chasing this white car and it stopped right in front of our view all of us got up and it was so intense the police ripped the driver out of the car and shoved him to the ground ohmygah that was good stuff also i cant fail to mention we all got to go boxes and bags and we took some pictures outside this was towards the hotels so away from maggianos my friend left her bag near a trashcan and left her coach wristlet inside we were all facing away when we were done with the picture she asked where her bag was we had no idea i said to not worry cause its just her food but none of us knew her credit card id and other important things were in it anyone couldve taken it luckily one of our friends saw homeless men downstairs carrying a maggianos bag and he looked inside the bag and pulled out the food and coach wristlet friends bf sprinted down the stairs and charged for the guy and said gimme that bag the homeless guy was pissed but gave it back if it wasnt for our one friend who saw him we wouldve never found it just wanted to share the crazy experiences from maggianos but i would definitely suggest this place its really good tried all of my friends food and perfecto not only was the food amazing and reasonably priced for the strip they were really accommodating to our time crunch because we were seeing a show after my table had gnocchi chicken parmesan eggplant parmesan and the rigatoni d and they were all extremely good the only word of advice is to park in treasure island or the wynnencore the mall parking is far from the restaurant the portobello ravioli was delicious an we also enjoyed the house rigatoni food and service was wonderful if you are heading this way for dinner i would suggest making a reservation great food good service the crab cakes were solid not pacific nw good but still great for the middle of the desert portions were large so wishing my wife and and i would have split and entree the lobster carbonara was excellent the bacon and lobster gave the spag noodles a rich flavor i actually find it insane that im giving a maggianos stars but it happens i guess this is definitely not fine dining unless you are part of the applebees red lobster sizzler crowd not to say the food is bad its either good or pedestrian depending on which side of the fence you are on the reason why im giving this place such a high score is because the service was extremely good the food was decent but too salty excellent food for the price and our waiter ryan was awesome very friendly and great service recommend for italian food and drinks a winner and ask for ryan pretty much one of the best places in town for italian food if you wanna do some shopping and get some grub go to the fashion show mall and find this place greatest lagasna you will ever have and their cheesecake is to die for amazing service and the atmosphere is not stuffy but very nice have a large party or want something more intimate they pretty much do anything for you here and they even have private banquet rooms for parties love love love maggianos its happy hour is no longer as good as before now stars on my book although still a great star restaurant for dinner yelpy details this nice mid scale restaurant is conveniently located on the strip nearby the lively fashion mall district it used to be my favorite spot for hh on the strip it has an inviting bar area with a classy bar counter and several bar tables around with a good selection of drinks and excellent service but my wife and i just had an unsatifying hh experience there recently one early fri evening inmid august mywife and i came here for happy hour again and were disappointed that they not only took away our favorite fried zucchinis from the happy hour food menu but also the entire bar menu now contained a grand total of only one item i e flatbread luckily the flatbread was delicious well my wife and i used to bring our out of town guests here for happy hour and dinner the place was almost always very crowded with happy customers in the past especially during its happy hour but on this fri evening around pm the bar area was practically empty with only tables occupied and only one customer at the bar counter we thought it could have a lot to do with the now very limited happy hour menu our nice and efficient waitress agreed well one more good point we were nevertheless pleased that they still give out their best tasting warm bread free which tasted heavenly especially dipped in olive oilbasamic vinegar bottom line for hh due to the diminished value and the empty space atmosphere on a fri evening at that id now give it only stars for hh on the other hand to be fair just back in march we brought friends over there for dinner not hh we did have a fabulous time with tasty dishes drinks and superb service so we wish that maggiano management would do something to bring back their popular hh menu and fill its place again for hh hints please put back fried zucchinis and perhaps even add crab cakes to its bar menu which is a great hit on schottsdale maggianos hh menu anyway until then i could still go there for a good dinner but will not likely go back there just for happy hour peterskis august took a recent trip to vegas and after walking around starving me and my bf decided to try out maggianos the ambiance is beautiful with rich furnishings and amazing views of the strip bread is brought to the table with butter but there is also olive oil on the table if you prefer to dip with that we started with an appetizer of tomato caprese that was very good next we shared the smaller version of the spinach salad that was amazing bacon pine nuts super yummy dressing etc and finally we split a plate of the chicken parmesan that was a large portion so big in fact we ended up taking the rest to go in a box in total those dishes water and coke was which i thought was very reasonable the sever was friendly prompt and attentive there was also a man with a guitar that would sing you a song at the time if you would like overall i liked the mood of the restaurant the romantic feel delicious food and wonderful service no complaints so my parents were in town visiting and my dad loves italian food we were on the strip and i remembered hearing about this place so we decided to give it a try this place definitely has some old world charm it feels a bit like dining at your nonnas house in typical strip fashion there were some people in prom style dresses and others in basketball shorts i love las vegas the place is huge and we were seated in a booth that felt a bit claustrophobic we tried to maneuver the table a bit but it was a tight fit even for me and i am pretty small regardless it was a bustling saturday night and we were seated within a few minutes and our waiter promptly appeared at our table of course we started with the bread and it was delicious i always appreciate olive oil and balsamic with a warm and chewy piece of bread after checking out the portion sizes on other tables i opted for a caprese salad figuring i could scavenge off of everyone elses plates the slices of tomato and mozzarella were quite large i like mine to be a bit more dainty but they actually had great flavor and it hit the spot for me i usually add salt to my caprese but in this case it was perfectly seasoned my husband ordered the rigatoni d which features chicken mushrooms and caramelized onions all tossed in a creamy marsala sauce it was definitely delicious i appreciated that the chicken had flavor on its own and each element really brought something to the dish it was even better reheated the next day my dad had the baked ziti and it was also well done it had a great tomato flavor with a hint of sausage i stole a little plate and also reheated it the next day for dinner my mom had the lasagna and it was pretty good i feel like lasagne is a dish that everyone makes at home and isnt very difficult to make and they had a pretty standard version i was very surprised with how well we ate and even more surprised to learn that this is a chain restaurant it made my picky dad happy and i would definitely return it is not the best italian food in town but not bad if youre in the mall or on the strip and want a good meal at a decent price we were struggling with trying to have a good reasonably priced dinner for in las vegas everyplace we called wanted us to rent a private room order from a pricey catering menu and guarantee a minimum believe it or not the totals were coming up to almost five thousand dollars including liquor tip tax and service charges we decided to have the dinner in our suite at caesars and have maggianos deliver best decision ever ashley guided us through the process and we had tons of great food at a fraction of the cost they delivered on time set everything up and left we even had leftovers for lunch the next day the food was actually better than i thought it would be bread desert salad entrees everything was great would use this place again total tab was under we spent another hundred at the liquor store setting up our bar even if you add the cost of our bedroom suite were still ahead first time i won in vegas great night eating here created wonderful memories from the amazing food excellent service and romantic violinist we had an evening to remember good food to many maggianos does not qualify as fine dining establishment primary because its a sort of chain restaurant and probably becaues they occasionally offer dealsdiscounts nonetheless my experiences eating maggianos in los angeles and in las vegas have proven that maggianos decor presentation of foods service food taste and overall dining experience has proven that maggianos is fine dining for the regular joe who likes good italian food wo having to skip out on a months worth of eating out because of one really expensive meal my experience maggianos in vegas was actually to a significant degree better than my few times at the grove location our waiter was actually a waiter in training but despite his lack of experience maggianos he indicated he had extensive experience at other restaurants the first class service he provided to us despite his nb status indicated to me that maggianos did not hire your commonplace waiter whos only job was to write down what you wanted not only was he able to describe to us in great detail the dishes we inquired about he was also honest about what dishes he tried and would recommend of course he did press us a bit to order more than just entrees so he was successful in getting us to order a few appetizers lol but those appetizers were all tasty and worth the price of entry like a person for our table of customizing your entree with a variety of different pastas and sauces and withholding from certain ingredients is expected maggianos they will ask you how you like things and if you arent keen on a certain ingredient the cook will gladly make it to your liking this also shows that their entrees arent mass produced and are made to order which is why food takes a bit longer than most to come out however our waiter also promised us that the pasta served was made on site and fresh daily thus enforcing my belief that maggianos is a high caliber restaurant finally one of the best parts of my experience eating maggianos is the fact that our waiter was extremely friendly able to hold conversations and joke around with the group and also treat us almost like a valued and welcomed patron of the restaurant yes we were eating during lunchdaylight hrs and it wasnt too busy but our waiter made the extra effort and it definitely showed cost for entree appetizers shared the table out the door for vegas thats a great deal for a sit in restaurant with some amount of class and zero strippershalf naked individuals i will definitely return to maggianos lv and hope to duplicate this prior positive dining experiences too dark booth for our party of began a disappointing dining experience caprese salad proscuito bruschetta appetizers caprese w flavorless mozzarella our pasta main course was undercooked although every dish had sat under the heat lampssalamander too long so tough ravioli penne wheat undercooked but meatball was pretty good since we were guests we did not send anything back i guess its just difficult for a well established and popular restaurant to consistently produce good food but that just doesnt make any sense does it what makes more sense is that they get so many customers theyll likely never see again quality doesnt matter good thing there is yelp food was great staffs are friendly very pleasant ambiance our banquet managers beth and sabrina helped us on planning the event we were miles away from them and i didnt have a problem communicating w them they will always respond to my questions email about the event planning they allow us to bring our own microphone centerpcs and even decorations to complete the picture stars because we only have staff javier helping us he is very courteous and gracious to attend all our demands however it always took him time to come and serve another guest mr friendly manager came to the rescue apologize and make it up with us bit of advice the patio is a little loud so if you are planning to have a solemn or event that needs a quiet environment you should choose their indoor banquets overall salute to maggianos for making our wedding reception a memorable one maggianos is both my husband and my favorite italian restaurant to eat at it is amazing fresh flavorful good portion size reasonable prices and a fantastic atmosphere dim energetic but not overly loud we love love love it staff is awesome only downfall is without a reservation you will have a wait sometimes even with one made a reservation here saturday night to celebrate my birthday dinner after hearing great things about the food reservation was for pm and we got there at pm waited for about minutes until going inside to ask the hostess how much longer we also asked what was the point of making the reservation if we had to wait for so long anyways the supervisor said that if we didnt like it then we could call and complain about it so after no apology or the supervisor even offering to check on the table for us we left very unhappy ended up going to a mexican place next to it where we were seated immediately and the food was delicious and the service was great for finer dining in las vegas my wife and i typically like going to mon ami gabi at the paris which is excellent of course we cant possibly eat there all the time so during our last las vegas trip we also tried maggianos little italy i understand this is a national chain one which i wasnt aware of at all up until now but if you didnt know that you would assume this was a single independently owned restaurant the atmosphere is very nice but not pretentious service was rapid and very personable like many italian restaurants especially on the strip in vegas this place is fairly expensive but if you do not go crazy on drinks and appetizers there are several reasonably priced entrees on the menu our bill with tip was under which is very reasonable for the large portions we received as well as the quality of food and service we experienced we experienced no real negatives and the view outside of the vegas strip while we were dining indoors was spectacular they also have outdoor seating though it is limited in the number of available tables one minor complaint is that they could turn down the air conditioning a notch but that is a common complaint anywhere indoors in vegas not limited solely to this restaurant weve experienced much colder air conditioning elsewhere in vegas they also did not serve butter with there bread but brought us some butter promptly when we asked for it their to go boxes are of high quality and very usable aluminum portion sizes were large enough for us to have leftovers we ended up taking with us on our flight back home my daughter ended up eating that and she was very impressed even though the food had just been reheated in a microwave instead of more properly in an oven for the price this is a well located and enjoyable italian restaurant it is well worth checking out in comparison to some of the more outrageously priced for arab sheiks italian restaurants on the strip this place is amazing my husband and i went there for a dinner date and it was magical the staff was really friendly and the food was delicious and in huge portions i couldnt finish my pasta and im an eater hehehe i just love it extremely overrated and not impressive at all i went here for a business lunch and i arrived a bit early the hostesses were very rude rather than nicely say were not open yet they had an attitude that was like go the away not a good start when i finally get in i head to the back where yes they have a screen setup and a sound system but the projector is being leveled by paper towels and was amateurish at best and the room we were in needed paint seriously when you take a look around the podium was chipped the walls had chips and im thinking for a place overlooking las vegas blvd that the experience was downgraded it may have been classy a while back but the management team needs to consider investing in a little bit of paint then we get to the wobbly tables and the family style food that was brought out family style might work in italy but this is america and to me family style is a masquerade for a kitchen that is too slow or chokes at cranking out high volume high quality plates in this case about the only thing good was the caesar salad as its hard to muck up a caesar salad but the rest of the food truly unmemorable if i was a tourist and i walked in expecting the place to live up even partially to its little italy name i would have felt like i was the victim of a mafia shakedown long story short yelp may have this place ranked at stars but theres not enough wine in italy that could make me intoxicated enough to give it anything over and thats only because im trying to be diplomatic about it needless to say if it wasnt for business functions i wont be back note to staff it takes money to make money investing in simple functional equipment and paint is a start next theyre called spices surely in the recipes that are used theres a line or two for various spices your food was barely notch above cafeteria food no wait i think a high school aged line cook at golden corral in amarillo texas could prepare better food than what i had you should be ashamed to slap the word italy anywhere near your doors i better stop typing before i end up clicking on just one star instead of two the service was exceptional and the food was outstanding i always try and eat here when i am in vegas fyi i am a very picky eater yet they always have something i like and they are always willing to make whatever i like if it is not on the menu will go again when i am back in town ps i booked my reservation online while i was sitting at the lv speed way watching drag races such an easy and perfect thing to do they had my table ready and waiting for my dad and i im not a fan of chain restaurants period but here is the skinny on maggianos i had the opportunity to eat here with a small group and a large group and you would think the experience would be better with a smaller group think again the menu is different and you definitely know you are eating at a chain restaurant food was heavy loaded with sauces and its obvious there are lots of can openers in the kitchen now believe it or not when you have people they serve a family style dinner and the food is a higher quality and the good pastas the sausage pepper appetizer is great but the most impressive is the deserts what a presentation and delicious there house chianti is great for the price i highly recommend it the service is also much better with a larger group go figure what a great menu excellent service too would recommend the family style for any group over we were able to try a little bit of everything everything from the chicken to pasta to seafood was great i am used to ny italian and this place was very good in comparison so i came here with a bunch of friends as our first group meal for a bachelor party weekend on a friday night we were all starving to be honest and this place had been set up as our go to stop we received a number of pre ordered dishes family style that were already included in our costs so i am not sure what the breakdown was but it was ayce and we definitely enjoyed the grub we had about guys and took over a gigantic table next to a bachelorette and her party and a bunch of normal patrons we had multiple courses and the food came out hot and tasty and in portions big enough for our entire table to get enough to eat at once pro tip call ahead and get a reservation a number of people had to wait quite a while in order to get seated who didnt the food was all decent to tasty and the chicken and pasta dish stuck out as the best to me it had some type of a white creme sauce with it the dinner also included appetizers and dessert its a tremendous amount of food and the only way to go if you dont want to hit up the buffets the one thing i will add is that the service is not exactly the best it took several requests before anyone brought us water or drink refills soda tea beer etc it was also a bit difficult to get additional bread n butter it just seemed to take an inexorably long time overall it was worth it and our service could have been affect by the sheer size of our group it is hard to say for sure i am over the moon about this place ive been here a number of different times and they consistently deliver the food is so authentic but you can count on a tasteful spin to your traditional italian dishes my mom recently ordered the chefs special rigatoni and for once in my life i saw her finish all her food i have the shrimp and polenta and it was off the hook yummy perfectly crisp and infused with an amazing lobster bisque sauce to top of it off they have the best soundtracks playing in the restaurant huge fan of this place and most definitely coming back im mixed on how to write this rate this review my wife and i have eaten there several times and always had good food and service we ate lunch there again last week the server i believe his name was jason was nice while going over all the specials advising his favorites and the wine list when he returned to take our order he became cold as ice towards us when we only ordered a salad and lasagna with no alcohol i guess he figured he wasnt going to get a big tip if we were not ordering an expensive meal while we were eating another waitress got us more bread and even refiled our water glasses what he didnt know is that we always tip big no matter the cost of the meal it is all about the service furthermore the reason we ordered the lasagna was because i had to eat something soft due to jaw surgery the week before and could not drink alcohol due to this surgery he even had the nerve to say when he began to clean the table i will try to carry these plates back without dropping them while making minimum wage what an insult to the customer for the first time ever we did not leave a tip someone there needs to teach him what to say or just shut up what a rude ass he was we go to vegas two or three times a year and always eat at maggionos i will be writing a personal letter to the manager and unless we receive an apology from them we will not be back there las vegas has too many other restaurants without putting up with this terrible waiter we were in vegas for a week we happened to walk by maggianos and my husband decided he wanted to try this we did show up on a very busy friday night without a reservation and we were ok with that they only had space at the bar we were ok with that we placed our order and i had asked for lemon with my water as she was busy i waited and waited and waited finally asked the bus boy for some lemon and he brought it almost immediately she happened to walk by saw the lemon and said oh you got your lemon i told her that the bus boy had brought her response yeah i asked him to just checking that he brought it wtf she lied from when we sat down to when we were served our appetizers an hour had gone by when we asked the waitress about our appetizers she became a little aggressive and said she was doing the best she could when we finally got our appetizers we asked her to bring the main course as soon as possible didnt know how long we would have to wait food not bad but certainly not impressed with the waitress best thanksgiving dinner misty made our evening so pleasurable preset menu family style had lots to eat even brought left overs for the next day yummy had lunch at maggianos in the fashion show mall it was a nice setting with an outdoor area we sat indoors but we had a great view of the palazzo hotel overall a gorgeous window view ordered the veal scaloppine piccata style and an arnold palmer the veal scallopine was flavorful especially with the pickled capers that had almost a tangy sensation there was also spinach placed at the bottom of the veal it was a light bed of spinach and i felt that i could have benefited with a bit more the dish came with a side of angel hair as for the drink it was just your typical arnold palmer half iced tea half lemonade our server seemed really versed with the various menu items and the ingredients at first i thought it was only our server and his personality that made him a great host but after listening in another table it seems all the servers are well trained and sociable i applaud the servers for their knowledge and service overall it was a good experience but not a restaurant of choice since its a chain when i am in vegas i prefer to dine in locations that are exclusive vegas restaurants i feel as though that would add to the experience versus eating at a chain that is readily accessible in my hometown the service and food was excellent i was a concierge here in las vegas before and have eaten at many fine establishments and i would say that this one is a new addition to the top of my list great classic italian and a wonderful view of the strip we will definitely be returning the purpose of our visit to maggianos was to carb load the night before the las vegas marathon which two of our party were actually running the other two were there to support the runners and the carb loading we were looking for somewhere close to treasure island at a reasonable price and maggianos fit the bill we made reservations through open table and were seated at our scheduled time the inside of the restaurant was quite nice but the tables are soooooo close together i kept bumping into the guy behind me there was a large party of obnoxious loud people but this tends to be the case at a lot of places in vegas we split the bruschetta as an appetizer and while it was delicious for the price i was expecting a bit more however they made up for portion sizes with the entrees my eggplant parmesam was posetively massive but still elegantly served which i appreciated another in our party had the chicken tortellonis and the two others had the gnocchi honestly mine was pretty good but i liked everyone elses selections better maybe i just chose something i wasnt in the mood for the bill was reasonable for vegas and the meal served its primary purpose however in comparison to alot of other places it was just okay and i wouldnt add it to my must visit while in vegas list made a special reservation for my sons st birthday party the entire family flew to las vegas for this event we have some food allergies and i spoke with the manager upon making reservations that our party of could not order family style i was told that they would make an exception and let us order al a carte and that he would be sure to note it in the reservation when we arrived they refused and said that they were too busy to accommodate us we ended up having to leave and went over to don vitos at south point hotel and had a delicious dinner that everyone could eat and thoroughly enjoy five stars to the food and service at don vitos greetings best italian in vegas i recently visited sin city and decided to get a late dinner at maggianos little italy i would like to start by saying ive never had better service for a late italian dinner in my life we showed up at and basically shut this place down but not before we met the server of the century jake the food was outstanding and it was as if jake new exactly what myself and my other wanted the moment we walked in hands down the best attention to detail ive experienced if you ever find yourself ready for a late italian dinner this is the spot ask for jake ask him a question and he has a long answer as for other highly rated main stream italian joints they have nothing on this place and best part about it below they have dollar you call it drinks enjoy i usually come to maggianos if i want decent italian food not anything amazing like you would find in other cities i have noticed that the only difference of lunch and dinner are the prices but the same portion very interesting usually the lunch portion would be way smaller but i really could not tell the difference the partyfamily style is definitely not worth the price i do admit that maggianos is probably not even comparable to bucca but still they overprice their food too much when i could probably get the same thing at a small family owned business it doesnt help that its on the strip the service is great make sure if you go on a holiday or a very busy weekend to make reservations the portions are great but the quality hmm im the type that prefers quality over quantity this place is delicious first time in vegas and wanted to get some good italian food im a customer for life now the food was amazinnnggg and the waiter we had was so nice he comped our drinks and gave us free cookies at the end i love this restaurant you wont be disappointed the environment is nice and it is a very classy place highly recommend i was impressed with this italian restaurant located in fashion show mall i was not aware this was a chain restaurant until my wife told me i wish they had one in san diego but the closest one to us is in orange county at the south coast plaza i ordered the four cheese ravioli which came with two sauces basil pesto and marinara evenly distributed over the dish the amount of ravioli was bountiful i was barely able to finish it and when i did i was really full my wife had the spaghetti with meatballs which she had no problem finishing we tried to eat here again before we left but it was too busy i think there was an hour wait and this was on a sunday night this is a good sign the restaurant is doing something right since there are plenty of choices at the mall the service was a bit slow but the waiter kept us informed on when our meals would be ready no big deal we were not in a rush even though i am not a big fan of chain restaurants this one is worth a try overall i agree with the vast bulk of the other reviewers i found the service to be friendly prompt and attentive my only major complaint was the chicken saltimbocca had full sized sage leaves under the crust on the chicken breast biting into one of these and eating it was akin to eating a car pine air freshener dont get me wrong i love sage its a big reason why i ordered that dish but a more deft hand would have used it to advantage not like an assault weapon loved the stuff mushrooms and crab cakes best italian food ive ever had and im italian every time my girlfriends and i visited las vegas we would come here at least twice over a week holiday to have dinner i love that the restaurant serves up food family style read larger portions meant to be shared among family andor friends which is how italian people serve their meals at home to their own families the food is authentic delicious and the servers always know their s i usually go for appetizers caprese zucchini fritte mozzerella marinara and a main ravioli eggplant parmesan manicotti one of my friends always raves about the baked ziti one of the best parts is that every time you ordered a main you could get a side of your choice of pasta from a list with a choice of sauce for an extra or we used to get this to go and eat it poolside the next afternoon for lunch cheap sweet more shopping and delicious i even brought some home on the flight for friends and family once obviously not counting my relatives home made italian cooking and the food is on par with the food served at terroni in toronto canada paid a visit over years ago for high school homecoming the server insisted on telling me what was standard tipping that was some of the most extreme unprofessionalism i have ever experienced at a restaurant on another note the veal is good just be kind to the young we work in restaurants too on my last outing to this venerable restaurant overlooking the strip on the edge of fashion show maggianos redeemed itself with a fine repast and picturesque view of encore our telephoned request for a booth with a strip view was honored despite the chagrined look of other hopefuls whom the maitre d had to fend off to preserve our pre reserved perch golden calamari fritte was on point and well made this time both rings and tentacles were lightly deep fried and excellent with great requested lemon aioli and mild marinara sauce bread and butter were very good and as always a bowl of savory tuscan orzo sausage soup sporting italian sausage fennel white beans fresh tomatoes and plenty of orzo was excellent where this soup is concerned to enjoy more stomach warming fluid rustic goodness i now always order a bowl rather than a mere cup a side caesar salad with grated parmesan and focaccia croutons in a creamy caesar dressing was excellent and stuffed chicken pizzaiola with mozzarella ricotta tropheo pasta pomodoro red peppers and pepperoncini was fine once i got to the middle of the chicken it was similar to chicken cordon bleu but zestier as usual a side of fontina potatoes was creamy and delicious this time we experienced excellent service as noel our server without any prodding carefully spaced out our meal orders so that the various dishes would not come out of the kitchen on top of each other all went well except for me killing one of my favorite polo shirts with food stains from marinara sauce followed by splatters from the orzo sausage soup after treating the stubborn marks with both zout and goo gone after six washings they still remain i will not give up either the sauce or the soup but next time i am in their close proximity regardless of appearances i will don a napkin to protect the front of whatever shirt i may be wearing at the time for a chain this is truly a fine one food was great however the practice of adding dollars to the credit card bill is not something i appreciate my total was i noted down on the receipt and somehow i got charged italian mob procedure eh its great place to dine classy with affordable prices the food s wonderful will always recommend to everybody to experience the best italian fine or casual dining this is my first time at a buyer beware restaurant when a customer takes a bite then returns a dish because its not good the restaurant doesnt happily take it back then charge for it anyway right not normal maggianos especially for a supposedly established chain upscale restaurant it was soggy bow tie pasta a spinach btw ick exchanged for pizza hut quality spaghetti marinara though they still charged for the more expensive bow tie we balked but they would not budge supposedly it came from the kitchen or management the nice waitress still got our normal tip bad taste in my mouth from a bland dish and dirty rotten maneuver first and last time thank you update after a whole lot of nudging they apologized and fixed the difference on my credit card they also said they were sending a little gift well now its been three months and nothing ever arrived so for same reason careless lack of regard seriousness for customer service stars unchanged the customer service training at this outfit just is rather careless and that doesnt feel good very nice people everyone i interacted with but they lack common classy restaurant business sense maybe its vegas culture and im used to l a and midwest i do sense theres a weird thing going on in vegas service culture anyway im ragging on their manners but two stars also reflects the quality of food its really quite unremarkable interior modern but likewise absolutely unremarkable but and this was nice a guy goes around and sings to your table dont know if thats regular normally would have earned a star for that upretensist spisested med store porsjoner og god vin er spesielt glad i coppola diamond collection simple chain restaurant with family style feel ive been to maggianos a few times and found the food very consistent i would recommend grabbing a reservation in advance of going here as it gets very busy rather than comment on all the dishes we had ill just generally say that everything was well cooked flavorful and something i would order again as for the service it was also excellent the menu is affordable and the service is great of course there are better restaurants lavo nove etc but not in this price range maggianos is consistently above average and this outpost in the fashion show mall is no exception the waitstaff was very attentive we were also able to take advantage of their buy one pasta dish take one home offer what a great value thanks foursquare this is my fourth visit and the food and service seem pretty much consistent ordered the margherita pizza for an appetizer and for my main course i had the spinach and chicken manicotti fortunately i also got to try the linguine di mare and the chicken parmesan that my party ordered they were all delicious but the manicotti has to be my favorite this is a very inexpensive restaurant with generous portions so its definitely worth the try after a long day of shopping be sure to call in advance otherwise youd be waiting as long as an hour and a half to be seated ask for a table next to the window with view of lvblvd not one of the best but still a pretty sight for you out of towners service is great and the food is super good one of my fav italian restaurant wonderful service i have been there before and have had a tasty rock shrimp lemon butter garlic pasta that was to die for however this recent visit i think i got an off night or just ordered the wrong things it was all good with the exception of the items being a little dry maybe more sauce was needed by chance next time im going to speak up because i like it alot and will be back i was recently at this restraunt for a birthday gathering superbowl sunday and oh my goodness was it delish the waiter nick was so helpful and nice to look at btw he really tended to us as we had a lot of people i will be goin here again do not pass go do not collect go directly to maggianos i had read the reviews about maggianos catering to their gluten free patrons and looked forward to our visit we were not disappointed i asked about a gluten free menu and the waiter told us they didnt have a menu but almost anything on the menu could be made gluten free they even offered to coat the chicken in potato chips and pan fry it if i wanted chicken parmesan someone pinch me i must be dreaming to make our visit even better we happened to come during happy hour when their signature cocktails were only yes please i ended up ordering the lobster carbonara and hubby ordered veal parmesan all i can say is wow my meal was beyond fantastic i fully expected tiny pieces of lobster and was astounded when my plate arrived and there were large chunks of lobster both meals were enough for two so we gladly took our leftovers back to our room and had them for lunch the next day hubbys grandmother came straight from italy and trust me these meals rivaled hers my only disappointment is we dont have a maggianos where we live seriously it was that good hands down the best italian food in town great atmosphere and location with very reasonable prices considering go there on a once a month basis and have no intentions on that changing keep up the good work loved the look and feel of this place would recommend for a quite dinner with that special someone i love this place they have the best italian food i can find here in vegas and their prices are pretty reasonable i always bring my friends from out of town who come to visit here and they always like it get your italian on another night at maggianos and another excellent dinner we started with fine complimentary warm bread and butter in our reserved booth with a window view of the strip and moved on to enjoy outstanding calamari fritte excellent tentacles and first rate golden rings along with the cheerfully provided lemon aioli we had requested to accompany marinara sauce a bowl of orzo sausage soup was also well prepared and excellent as a whole with sausage just tangy enough to make it intriguing although iced teas regularly arrived unbidden i had to ask for butter twice it was quickly produced after the second request cold crisp romaine leaves bathed in a thin application of a nice traditional caesar dressing and small crunchy croutons dominated an excellent side caesar salad belatedly i asked for a single anchovy semi health consciousness at work and it was duly brought in its own ceramic cup to further enhance this course great cheesy fontina potatoes represented a perfect blend of cooked potato slices and fontina cheese and were more than enough to share with diane this time my entree of linguini clams was superb with a fine light white wine sauce clams still in the beds of their opened shells and a generous amount of supplemental chopped clams meanwhile diane did her best to attack large medallions of veal parm with excellent yummy alfredo sauce accompanied by al dente rigatoni alfredo at meals end she still had enough food left over for a very satisfying lunch two days later and we were both too full to order dessert once again i unintentionally dropped and left items under our dining table this time when i pulled up on the driveway of my north las vegas home i found that both a filled pill case and all of my house keys were missing from my coat pocket after a call to the restaurant and a check under our former table by restaurant management all items were found so for the second time in months after dining here i headed back to fashion show mall and retrieved my dropped items from the check in desk they had been found on the floor of the same booth where my kindle had been inadvertently abandoned on a previous visit so in the future i either have to avoid this particular booth or take better care of my important personal possessions i think i will concentrate on the latter course of action sticker sticker sticker sticker shock when i saw the bill thank goodness it wasnt my turn lol everything was good its in a decent location to where they can change you premium solely for location but its definitely a delight everything was delicious the service was exceptional would definitely dine again maggianos is a good choice this one is located in the fashion show mall pretty much across the street from the the wynn even though its an outpost of a chain they do a pretty good job with the food the veal marsala was a generous portion and was excellently prepared pastas were really good and filling service was friendly and competent the restaurant was buzzing and filled with diners which is always a good indicator a meal here will cost you much less than at a budget buster celebrity chef restaurant and the experience will be almost as good im looking forward to going back my husband and i ate here the last night of our vegas vacation the atmosphere was wonderful the food out of this world i couldnt believe how reasonable the prices were we would have paid similar to our local olive garden only way better and would have had to wait an hour to get a table i would highly recommend maggianos our waitress asked if we were having a special occasion and we told her we celebrated our th wedding anniversary and she brought us out complimentary dessert with lit candles oh boy this was probably my best meal during my stay in vegas the food here is breathtakingly good particularly the appetizers get the stuffed mushrooms you will thank me the bruschetta is also worth mentioning i guarantee youll be asking for more bread to scoop up the abundance of tasty tomatoes for dinner i had the chicken marsala which was very good my boyfriend got chicken franchise which according to him was decent the potatoes and salad that his meal came with were excellent our waiter was very sweet everything for me was truly above average i hope the maggianos in the tri state are equally amazing i heard good things about this place so i went with a friend it was jam packed there and it took us a bit to get a table but it was well worth the wait i got the lobster carbonara which i could not get through granted i had a salad and bread you get a good portion size which is nice i recommend making a reservation before going here for dinner there is a reason it is packed its on the strip and the food and atmosphere are great nice place what a great spot in vegas it may be a chain but its run like its an original great service and decor food was pretty good as well the gf and i got bruschetta and stuffed mushrooms for apps both were great for dinner the gf went with chicken marsala and i with the francaise both came with sides i opted for the fried potatoes and she for the linguine with garlic and oil i threw in a side of broccolini to have a nice lil veggie in the mix well apps marsala salty but good francaise it wasnt bad but i have had much better and expected more ling with go no taste at all potatoes broccolini nicely cooked and seasoned in garlic and oil the menu is very extensive and overall it was a great time with the gf i am looking forward to checking out the maggianos in north jersey my friends and i were tired and hungry from walking and just decided to go in here and im pretty glad we did we got seated by the window so we had a pretty nice view of the strip the food was good i ordered the steak and it was really tender and well flavored what i didnt like was that our waitress disappeared most of the time and was no where to be seen and also my drink manhattan it was a little too strong for me and not like what the waitress described it to be refreshing and sweet my husband and i hosted our wedding reception here after a wonderful ceremony at the wynn it turned out to be a great decision location wise it was very easy for our guests to get to from the wynn we had a couple of older relatives and being able to drive up to the valet area and drop them off was super planning the banquet staff was responsive and accommodating they also took care of everything saving us the hassle of trying to manage multiple vendors we selected the cocktail reception package after signing the initial contract the only other planning we had to do was answer the occasional email about headcount or food and beverage choices facilities beautiful banquet room our decorations were minimal some flowers on the tables but thats all the place really needed maggianos let us drop off the decorations the morning of and the banquet staff did a knock out job of decorating the room for us we rented out all portions of the banquet room which was great for our person reception we also got access to the terrace which was great for the smokers let us enjoy a view of the strip and kept the temperature perfect for the event food staff amazing everyone loved the food the staff was quick to respond when food ran out in the banquet lines new food came out fresh and hot bar tending staff was awesome no one waited in line very long also the staff made my husband myself and our photographer to go boxes with extra food because they were afraid we didnt get enough to eat how awesome is that do yourself a favor and let the awesome staff at maggianos handle your reception professional painless and the end to a perfect day just got back from a wedding in vegas where the reception was held at maggianos the atmosphere inside is elegant but comfortable the private room was perfect in size with a large bar at the front and a balcony overlooking the strip the service during the reception was stellar i told our bartenderserver about my gluten allergy and she was immediately able to identify substitutions and alternate courses for me that would meet my needs she knew exactly what to do and made me feel at ease right away i had an awesome chopped salad to start with that made the other non gluten free people around me jealous then i enjoyed marsala mushroom and chicken gluten free pasta oh my god it was out of this world i need to go to the maggianos and tampa asap to have this again finally for dessert i had the creme brulee again making everyone around me jealous the meal was unbelievable kudos to the staff and chef at maggianos for making the whole night perfect both for guests and for the bride and groom i have not visited an italian restaurant since i learned of my allergy but now i absolutely have to go back to maggianos if you are in vegas definitely make this a dinner spot at least one night of your stay this visit was to celebrate alicia rs birthday the wonder twins aka terri r and alicia r invited me and you know i am not turning down a good meal with the hottest twins in las vegas besides its been forever since i step foot in here its had to be at least years and ive been really missing out ive only been to one other maggianos and that one is located in costa mesa maggianos use to be the place where my favorite sister would take me for my birthday all i remember from maggianos is a lot of good food huge portions great service and long waits even with a reservation this maggianos is a lot similar to the costa mesa location this place was packed on friday great food huge portions and great service only difference which is a big one there was zero wait i had their parmesan crusted tilapia which was really good and the portions had to be triple of what you get compared to other restaurants the price tag is pretty good considering that i had over oz of great tasting fish after my meal i washed it down with scoops for their vanilla bean ice cream i offered to share but everyone in our table had their own treat i didnt want to put my dessert to waste so i killed it theres not too many maggianos around in any city i believe that this is the only one in las vegas ive never had a poor experience at maggianos and recommend if youre looking for fine italian food with huge portions ps happy birthday to alicia r aka terri rs twin aka my k partner aka my half marathon inspiration aka yes and aka the former finger printing lady ha ha and more nicknames to come i generally stay away from chain italian food that being said the food was not bad i had a capresse salad and the tomatoes could have been of slightly higher quality but otherwise it was ok certainly good enough for a safe tourist meal unpretentious simply classy affordable good food if you want a little italian while in vegas but dont want all the hoopla this is your place its just like the great italian spot you and your wife always go when youre craving a delicious chicken parm recommend went here with my fiances family and this place was amazing they are sicilian so you can only imagine how important real italian food is to them we had a party of and they treated us so nicely anyway the bathroom has the best napkins i have ever dried my hands with i know weird right and apparently the mens has some pretty cool artwork above the urinals according to my fiance the food is amazing hot yummy some of the family had the raviolis lasagna sausage appetizer salads the shrimp linguine all was superb will be going again when in vegas like prior comments it is a chain restaurant but run like an original thanks again for the lovely time disclaimer the only time i come here is for large birthday gatherings featuring the extremely young and the extremely old ive never independently chosen to eat here i will say they have their sht together when it comes to large private gatherings theyre always well staffed and organized unlike other spots in town cough pj clarkes cough the private rooms are also spacious and feature large windows youre not in some afterthought back room further the portions they provide for groups are enormous even if there are people at a table it never runs out in fact i usually get stuck with taking home leftovers just what i always wanted lbs of artichoke dip but large portions arent really a godsend if the food is just meh ive had the chicken eggplant parmesan chicken piccata penne with meat sauce spagetti caesar salad stuffed mushrooms calamari profiteroles and none of it was memorable overall they serve up very basic italian food meant to please the masses something easily achieved when the patrons are seven years old had our wedding reception in the banquet hall and it was an amazing space for our party great service great food great drinks highly recommend yummy parmesan in crusted talapia mommas lasagna fettuccine alfredo cesar salad to stars from all four of us fettuccine alfredo is a huge portion yes its a chain but the food is always delicious i love every shrimp dish they offer the traditional italian dishes are average but my hubby loves them service can be hit or miss i just love the quality of food enough to forgive the occasional semi bad waiter forgetful have to ask multiple times for one thing not a biggie great salads food and service there is not a bad seat in the house stopped by for happy hour food was good not remarkable but yummy however we were bowled over by the service nicole waited on us and she was fantastic really made our experience much nicer went with a party of went family style and two hours later still no entree manager understood the frustration and said server was new manager comped the bill but didnt eat the food after two hours waste of my time and the restaurants supposed service disappointing in both expectation and execution excellent food never had a bad meal or service here i always get the take home classic pasta i am a huge maggianos fan at the bellevue washington location and was excited to see one of my favorite places on the strip we get to the restaurant at ish with a party of we are told about hour wait okay no problem after looking around and seeing countless open tables we ask why cant we sit at one of the patio tables they responded with they are reserved but we dont know when they are showing up we finally take a seat after an hour wait for the table that was previously reserved but the group never showed up i was over it and excited and very hungry we ordered the first all you can eat family deal the food was amazing as always the service was slow couldnt answer simple menu questions do you meatballs have pork in them they dont they are beef up to this point was was frustrated that everything seemed disorganized sloppy and chaotic it took minutes to get bread on the table the reason for star we were given a table outside on the patio and i was in the back corner of the table as i was sitting at the table i scooted my chair over and back about it turns out there was a hole about deep that used to have a hand rail post sticking out of it but was removed to make more room i fell back in my chair and some how caught myself mid fall to avoid slamming my head into the cement wall behind me i pop up and my dad said the dishwasher behind me had a look like i almost died and the server next to me said when i was in the hole pulling my chair back out oh yeah there is a hole there wtf kind of observation is that if you know about a preexisting hazard fix it long story short i pulled something my back and was instantly hurting we contacted the manager who seemed on top of offered to take me to the hospital and call him if i had any problems i wasnt about to have my last night in vegas be ruined by that for my pain and all this we got taken off the bill and i left hurting and in pain i think this was a weak compensation for the pain the and hazard have my mom or dad been sitting here they physically couldnt have caught there balance as fast and would have been seriously hurt fantastic food loved that yelp helped us get a reservation at the time we wanted walked right in and they were ready for us i had the chicken caprese a special of the day and it was amazing i second the hit and miss service we had to ask for more water and for our check they were busy but found that annoying the mints are yummy take a few despite service issues i would definitely return and highly recommend loved this place their food is amazing we had the lobster carbonara and one of their vegetarian ravioli dishes on their make a wish menu both were very tasty plates range from about on average the steak dishes are about double that the chocolate cake is a must love the food here its extremely good and i definitely recommend the daily specials the outdoor patio is fantastic and as theres few places on the strip where you can eat outdoors this is a great option for dining al fresco service is good but it can take a while for your food to arrive one of the reasons i chose this place is that they will prepare your dish gluten free on request if you ask they also can substitute regular pasta with gluten free pasta good selection of wines by the glass but its rather expensive a glass is out of my league however they do have a happy hour from pm to pm mon fri with a selection of beer wines and cocktails for or less more on gluten free in las vegas https www facebook comgroupsgluten free las vegas good location right at fashion show mall fantastic italian food prices are not to bad either good pasta good desserts good view ive eaten at maggianos in princeton new jersey and in atlanta georgia i really wanted to try las vegas maggianos it did not disappoint i ordered the chicken fettuccine alfredo which was delish the warm italian bread dipped in seasoned olive oil was finger licking good not that i licked my fingers i had three delicious dishes for the mini dessert sampler new york style cheesecake yummy apple crostada yummy and chocolate zuccotto cake yummy the price was pretty good i dined alone as my friends were napping to recover from the evenings debaucheries i will be back the best italian family style restaurant what a pathetic excuse for italian food in fact what a terrible excuse for food in general i ordered the parmesan crusted tilapia which included mushy and obviously frozen fish and a bed of watery and bland spinach leaves total and orzo pasta all off this was doused in an excess of capers and way too finely chopped cheap tomatoes however taste and presentation aside and once all scraped off the fish had a terribly sour after taste upon bringing it up to the waiter it was blamed on the capers great endorsement of the kitchen recipes however after i left my stomach was ill the entire night and into the next day sparing the intimate detail of my night spent with the toilet the summary of this meal is that the fish was frozen and once defrosted it was obviously left out beyond expiration and then cooked and presented with the effort of a st grader at this point id rather go vomit again than ever visit this establishment again as an italian and really as a human who eats food im insulted at what this place is dishing out spend an extra a dish and go to d o c g in the cosmopolitan instead for real italian food great family priced meal for a large group came here to celebrate a birthday and we enjoyed only disappointing was the gnocchi waiter was excellent and the desserts were very enjoyable hadnt been here in a while and it was very yummy glad to see the recession didnt drag the quality down like at so many other chains highly suggest maggianos inside the fashion show mall on the las vegas strip great quality italian yummy appetizers delicious meals like momma would make request a table with a view you will love your visit even more friendly staff always go there when im in the mood for the best italian food in sin city great place to take a date or get family style dining with the friends or family maggianos has a great dinner time environment we sat by the windows facing the strip and it was really beautiful to have the dark dining room looking out towards the bright lv strip the food was excellent and exactly what it should be at this price point the food is not homemade but i think thats pretty apparent by the fact that it is in a mall it is however made to order and above the quality of most other chain restaurants tiramisu here was the best i have ever had i am still pretty new to tiramisu as i have only had it about five times but wow is it really good here i will probably stop in just for the tiramisu every time i go shopping at fashion show make sure and try it great location in vegas food is god price is reasonable nothing too especial about it very small outdoor seating great indoors if youre in the mood for overly salted italian food crafted specifically for the purpose of an american tourist palate and appetite then please come to maggianos little italy its helpfully located in the fashion show mall as to beckon the tourists who cannot afford or do not know what real and when i say real i mean decent italian food is i ventured here with a gift card for lunch my intent was to have the following a tasty adult beverage a soup and a main dish being that one of my favorite italian dishes linguine clams was on the menu i knew i would order it first off i arrived a la solo which i dont think should be weird especially for lunch these days of course the hostess attempted to seat me at the bar to which i declined politely and was lead to a table in the dining area impressions at least it is well lit during the daytime hours with plenty of windows for viewing the surrounding strip attractions however table cloths were rumpled salt and pepper shakers had a waxy build up on them this comes from a restaurant wiping them down with nothing but a damp towel i should know i was a server in college starters i ordered a peach bellini and my server brought bread sad pitiful but at least warm bread he did not pour my evoo which is on the table nor did he offer me any balsamic yet as i watched around me servers plated evoo and balsamic for their tables the peach bellini arrived in a martini glass i was disappointed in that and then even further disappointed that my peach bellini was not garnished at all and it had no actual fruit in it it was overly sweet and not worth soup i ordered the creamy chicken potato soup it was salt salt salt salt the vegetables were obviously of the frozen variety and the presentation was horrific the soup had spilled over the side of the cup and they hadnt bothered to at least wipe it linguine clams with red sauce this dish should be called linguine with clams because there was barely a trace of sauce in my bowlplate there were so many noodles i thought the waiter had served me a portion for three people i get it this is a family style place but for lunch portions also also salt salt salt the dishes here are obviously doctored to an americanized iodized diet hefty in portions and in salt i could barely stomach my noddles and although the clams were decent there was no seafoodbrine taste to this dish that should be there comparing this linguine clams to others i have eaten mainly at chicago joes downtown well i just cannot even compare the two they do not make lunch portions the lunch is just a shortened menu of their dinner you get ginormous dinner portions and you pay the same amount of money its honestly a tourist trap rip off i am sure the better ratings of this place are coming from tourists but being a local i can only offer this advice there are much better italian places in town find them and stay away from maggianos thank goodness i had a gift card what to say about this place it is our fav spot for italian food awesome service awesome long island drinks awesome food i just hope they will not disappoint me ever because i just cant stop comparing others with them love love love this location we recently had our wedding reception here for guests i cannot describe how perfect everything went from the ambiance decor to the food all our guests loved every minute and will eat here every time they visit vegas from now on thank you maggianos we had lunch there today we had peach pomegranite lemonade it was so good we got some to go we shared the stuffed mushroom appetizer and shared the chicken florentine both dishes were awesome our server was friendly and did not care in the least that we were not having alcohol for lunch or that we were sharing in order not to feel stuffed when we left we have eaten at maggianos in atlanta a couple of times and the service and food was not this good we would definitely eat here again this is by far my favorite italian restaurant i think as far as value goes you get a great experience the views are great at this location being right on the strip and having the whole wall on the strip side being windows its a great view of the wynn and encore hotels ive had so many different meals here and never been disappointed the chicken parm the rigatoni dmy favorite pasta dish here and the marsala are all fantastic for the price it is the best italian restaurant i have ever been too and have been going to this maggianos location for the last four years ive been to places in vegas that are twice the price half the portion and the food quality dont miss this place if your in vegas atmosphere food is disappointing yum first of all this place is really big and the interior has a good blend of homey yet classy and kind of made me feel like a snobby foodie the restaurant has window panes across two sides and allows for a nice view of las vegas blvd but not like a straight down the strip kind of view our server was very gracious and the bread was amazing i ordered chicken florentine with angel hair which absolutely blew my mind the chicken was stuffed with spinach parmesan cheese and sun dried tomatoes and coated with bread crumbs the flavors and textures were all perfect the best part was that the lunch price was not too price at all most of the pasta items were in the low teens and the portions were enormous i highly recommend this place to anyone who is visiting vegas i eat here about twice a year and love the place its above average italian for a fair price i generally avoid carbs like the plague but this place had bomb diggity salads and wonderful protein options i usually order the salmon either grilled or on a caesar salad and its never bad no it isnt the best fish youll ever have but for the price you shouldnt be expecting such things i am all about reasonable expectations with food id give the food a and the service a in the out of five stars department went here after shopping in the fashion show mall as me and my friend both wanted italian and i had come here before and knew that the food is pretty good last time i came here i had a caesar salad which was good and is my favorite but i decided to try the maggianos salad this time it was good but it ended up being pretty filling so i was almost too full to eat my spaghetti and meatballs but luckily i took it home for later i dont have anything negative to say about the food and the wait time was minutes which is average for dinner time in vegas our server was decent he could have refilled my watersoda more and he had to double check what we ordered even after asking us twice when he originally took our order we sat by the window which was great for a view of the strip i dont ever go out of my way to go to maggianos but the food is good and so is the staff slow slow slow service the food was good for me my husbands filets were tough so he did not like it kids liked their food but waiting for the main course was a big turn off for us atmosphere and service were great however the food was just average lobster carbonara tasted like what you would expect from the olive garden italian sausage flat bread was ok as well there are plenty of other restaurants in vegas that i would try again this weekend i had a beautiful private dining experience at maggianos at fashion show my friends hosted my baby shower in a private room with a great view and patio included for people passed appetizers food table dessert table and open bar it turned out beautifully and i could not be happier we worked with sabrina banquet manager who was superb she recommended a menu which was delicious and everyone loved the food for my mixed group vegetarians kids and adults and helped us orchestra a budget that worked for the hosts i cannot tell you how grateful i am to have someone so lovely and gracious be a part of my special afternoon with my dear friends and family i would do this again the exact same way and im looking for reasons to book another get together in the same spot located in the fashion show mall tons of parking and glass windows to enjoy the scenery reservations highly recommended as it can get very busy ive eaten here several times and for some reason i keep coming back it must be the large portions and great service food spinach salad tender leaf spinach tossed with diced red peppers roasted red onions and gorgonzola cheese yummy applewood smoked bacon toasted pine nuts and apple cider vinaigrette tomato caprese sliced tomatoes topped with fresh mozzarella and basil drizzled with a balsamic glaze and crispy calamari dinner lobster carbonara it was dry so i would never order it again moms lasagna with meat sauce beef tenderloin medallions it really not a bad place despite of what others has said to me its reasonably priced service was great and i love the complimentary bread my brother and i went there when we were in las vegas and the food was very delicious the belinis were out of this world the manager came to check up on us at the table to see if we were being taken care of this was of course during a commercial he was watching the game on the tv screens and couldnt be bothered during the game and kindly waited for a commercial after lunch the manager and the waitstaff were congregated in the front of the reception area as we were about to leave and my brother and i both felt we were breaking up coffee talk other than that the experience was great as well as the food called to make reservations for a party of hostess on the phone said they were booked and pretty busy however we can walk in and wait on the way down i was able to make reservation via internet however we still thought the restaurant would have at least an hour wait for a busy saturday night as the hostess stated come to our surprise restaurant was far from busy and we were sat almost instantly very pleased with the food great sized portions complimentary bread oil and vinegar however being lied too over the phone was rude and almost made us change our dinner plans for the evening i went their for my husbands birthday the food was really good omg the four cheese ravioli are the best if youre planning to go you have to try them i know this is not an authentic italian place but some of their dishes are just the bomb like the rigatoni d omg and their penne with meat sauce i dont know i just love love love it it so hits the spot i make crazy good pasta sauces all the time so i am a skeptic but sometimes even the commercialized stuff can be tasty another chain restaurant where we decided to check out the vegas branch this was a very large location with a fun view of the strip service was attentive and friendly and our food was fine definitely edible but nothing special my peach bellini was my favorite part i went here for my st birthday dinner thankfully it was in walking distance from my hotel the food was amazing everyone in my party party of loved what they got and devoured it i ordered the linguine de mare and it was amazing i also heard great things about the spaghetti my friend said it reminded her of the way her grandma would make it the service was good and i enjoyed being serenaded for my birthday by the cutest old man playing the guitar overall very pleased with my experience nice place for a lunch if youre in fashion show and dont want standard food court food this was a great place to eat on the strip we didnt have reservations but we took seats in the bar area other reviews suggested reservations so if you have a large group or need to make a show make reservations i had the tomato basil soup and chopped salad both were wonderful my husband had the spaghetti and meatballs my children had the cheese raviolis and the penne pasta they also offer family style meals if you prefer that the waitress was very friendly and service was great i would recommend this to anyone going to vegas so much of the food we ate was overpriced and mediocre this was reasonably priced and delicious we met up with a group of friends at maggianos on a friday evening for one of their birthdays due to the size of our party we ordered family style this works out better for appetites such as mine as i can usually help devour whatever is left over we went with the larger set up of family style meals which looked to be a good deal as we awaited our appetizers and salads an older gentleman stopped by the table with his acoustic guitar to sing some songs he played three including happy birthday and wished our friend another happy birthday before he went to another table and proceeded to play the same three songs but with more gusto for them and to the next table you guessed it same three songs the appetizers came out we opted for the fried mozzarella and zucchini the mozz was great wish there was a little more sauce on the plates or some ranch the fried zucchini came with what looked like ranch so it all worked out nope that is a lemon sauce that masquerades as ranch when asked for a side of ranch we were rebuffed with a we dont carry ranch here ok then our main courses began to roll out this time our table became filled with lasagna ravioli alfredo and a go to italian dish chicken parmagiana where to begin the lasagna had a very pre madefrozen taste to it however stouffers tastes more authentic than maggianos their iteration of chicken parm was ghastly it seemed like it was cooked in a microwave with its rubbery tough dry and flavorless texture i did not partake in the ravioli or alfredo until the next day which is where i messed up those two dishes were the best of the four we chose desserts came out and they looked amazing i however dont eat dessert so i can only go off of the very little that was left to ascertain that it was pretty good onto day i awoke saturday morning with some serious pain a mixture of i ate too much and now i am starving and run after a few trips to eliminate the intestinal pain i was feeling good again that evening my wife re heated the leftovers we were given according to the instructions on the to go containers once more into the breach we went devouring what was left the ravioli and alfredo i skipped the night before were really tasty and i wished i had tried them the first night sunday morning was a repeat of saturday morning needless to say i shant be patronizing maggianos again the service was pretty good the ambiance was nice as is usually an issue for restaurants it was the food that will keep me from going back we had our wedding reception at maggianos on after our wedding ceremony at wynn las vegas it was stars they took excellent care of us and we planned everything from out of town we live in la the reception could not have been more perfect and everyone at maggianos made it so easy for us our banquet captain jessie mzoughi was incredible i highly recommend them for your reception or any event spur of the moment decision to eat at maggianos food was good not great and service lacked in every way horrible is being nice they had an excuse for everything do not recommend wait staff was not professional great customer service from our waiter pete he was awesome very friendly and attentive portions are so big you can share great authentic italian food i tried to go here last night party of five the hostess told us that it would be an hour and minutes before we could be seated even though there were only a couple of people waiting and there were a few tables inside and all but two tables outside were being used no problem we went downstairs to ra and had a great meal for over six years now whenever my wife and i go to vegas this place has been a favorite i love the gnocchi and italian sausage but havent had anything i didnt like picture this last night monday night in vegas again on business four of us looking for a good meal walk up to the counter and they are telling everyone its an hour and a half wait good thing i had a reservation we were seated in minutes to be exact not bad for an reservation it was all good as always the service and especially the food went here today nd aug whilst in vegas we havent left vegas yet and i felt i needed to write a review everything from start to finish was horrible i ordered the chicken parmesan the chicken was tough over cooked and tasteless it came with a side of spaghetti marinara the spaghetti was over cooked mushy and the whole thing was very plain needless to say i didnt even eat half of my meal my friend ordered some sort of pasta and seafood dish i cannot remember the name and despite that naturally having slightly more flavour due to it being seafood the pasta was mushy also and tasteless i asked for bottled water they brought me tap water which i thought ok cool nevermind i dont know what they did to the tap water there but maybe it was the ice cubes they used but there was a hideous aftertaste of antiseptic our server never checked on us once because if so i would have told her i disliked my meal and also ordered another drink we had to ask her for the cheque three times and after we finished eating our meal and were given our cheque it was minutes before our plates were cleared needless to say i will not be returning our waiter antonio was ah maze ing he took the best care of us the most incredible service love him loved this place first time there was a date night with husband and since we have a new baby it doesnt happen very often food was amazing service was fast and the manager gave us a free dessert in celebration of the special night will be going back for sure ive been to maggianos a number of times and i have not been disappointed yet the calamari is delicious as are most of the pastas on the menu my biggest complaint is the price even though the food is good i really dont feel that it justifies the high price tag there are a number of basic pastas that you can get for less than but these are bare bones dishes while still good youre going to have to spend per dish if you really want to experience what they really have to offer that makes them great the atmosphere at maggianos differs between restaurants the maggianos in denver has a much more classy and quiet environment with great ambiance the vegas location is much more noisy usually overcrowded and the service much more casual heres a few tips make a reservation online and in the comment box request a booth very good food excellent service loved that they have gluten free pasta choices our whole party was happy with their entrees the lobster carbonara was especially tasty lost one star for wine list not as robust as wed hoped made a reservation here and was seated with no problem but then again there was no wait service was pretty good my girlfriend and i came as a short last dinner before heading back to reality i would give our server a solid ba considering menu explanation time it took to get his attention he remembered my to go order and we spent less than an hour there from being sat to exiting we had side spinach salad with gorgonzola cheese pretty yummy i am a fan of gorgonzola but i think huge chunks were a little much even for me dressing was a little heavy linguine clam good broth in the pasta healthy amount of clams peppercorn steak w the maggianos sauce which was carmelized onion and such so yummy a bit salty so you have to eat it with the mashed potatoes but the potatoes had melted cheese and it was so so good do want to mention that this restaurant did not have the classic buy one take one home menu options that are available at a lot of other chains though i love maggianos i cant get enough of the famous rigatoni d they have the best calamari i am also in love with the marinara sauce they use for the spaghetti as well as the chicken parmesan friendly staff usually not very crowded when i come here i feel like im in the s with the music they play definitely one of my favorite places to eat a tourist trap where location may be the only thing to recommend it food at a level lower than a chain italian and service was completely absent minded at least they comped a drink and a meal from our party of four avoid as there are so many good options why waste your limited dining experience on a restaurant that has such indifferent food and service we had our wedding reception here on august rd it was perfect the food was amazing and there was lots of it our guests were thrilled we had guests so we took up all of the banquet space the dance floor was packed the entire time thanks to the dj they recommended to us we also used their vendors for cake and photo booth sabrina was very accommodating and quick to respond to my questions via email or phone i cannot recommend this place enough as a wedding reception venue it looks good without any decor even especially for wynn brides it is very convenient great food typical italina food or americanized italian food rather when i was visiting las vegas my sister said this place was good so we went to eat here for lunch and happy hour i was impressed the margherita flat bread from the happy hour menu was more than a foot long and so delicious the house bread was warm and soft i ordered the eggplant parmigiana and it was so good the eggplant was juicy and not dry and the spaghetti was perfectly cooked and the sauce was not too thick which i like the staff was nice and friendly and very attentive love love lovvveee the foood i would eat there everyday if i could everything is made from scratch no presevatives no frozen food tastes awesome i had the beef tenderloin with a side of mash potatoes and asparagus and the spinach artichoke appetizer to start with couldnt finish off with desert this time way too full but ive had the tiramisu in the past and its devine waiter suggested special chicken lasagna alfredo sauce almost non existent but dish still good ordered the second special ravioli with lemon cream sauce it arrived and the sauce was like warm milk very watered down sent it back and split the lasagne viva las vegas was my destination this weekend and decided to take the girlfriend and parents to dinner here i always enjoy this place did the family style and if you never done family style food well get on it its fun great food from appetizers to entrees and also the desserts everyone agreed the moms lasagna was amazing the gnocchi italian sausage was incredible the crab shrimp cannelloni was to die for and linguine clams red or white clam sauce was out of this site so heads up if you do go maybe call ahead of time its a super busy place we totally lucked out and sat outside since it was nice evening but inside is very nice do you need to dress up i would say at least wear a collar shirt guys our waitress for the evening was very helpful and very fun the only problem it took a while for us to get our appetizers which she apoligized all night long we didnt mind we had our drinks in hand and having a good time but other then that another great experience in the book hope you guys enjoy because the food is amazing terrible hostesses i walked in at abd asked how long the wait for people was i was told no wait i said my people will be here at six can i put my name in a list knowing it would get busy st sux i was told the wait was an hour take your seats immediately even if your party is not there yet customer service is non existent they count on the one shot tourist trade after some discussion the manager mike m made things right hopefully his staff will improve under his tutelage amazing italian in vegas especially for a chain the lobster ravioli never disappoints the drinks are allways off the chain the only thing that stinks is the wait super location decent prices if youre looking to dine on strip outside a casino love thi splace vorneweg das ambiente ist klasse der service sehr gut und das essen ist auch hervorragend man kann hier in einer gemutlichen atmosphare einen schonen abend verbringen der service ist hilfsbereit immer zu stelle und entspricht allen positiven vorurteilen zum essen aber einen hinweis es schmeckt ausgezeichnet aber es macht sehr satt die groe der portionen ist landestypisch die menge des kases auf den gerichten auch und ebenso die menge der schokolade auf dem tiramisu vielleicht ein wenig uberladen fur europaischen geschmack aber keinesfalls schlecht mit landestypisch ist hier ubrigens nicht typisch italienisch gemeint aside from the box pasta they use i enjoyed my time here we made a reservation via yelp and was immediately seated upon arrival the food was so so the lasagna was dry and the linguine with clams sauce did not stick to the pasta im from chicago and this maggianos was not great my husband and i came here for my th birthday dinner and let me just tell you our waiter anthony made our experience absolutely exceptional he made conversation like we had known each other for years we wanted to hug him on our way out the door my husband and i have traveled a lot and it was the best service we have had anywhere the food was delectable i had the lobster carbonara and my husband had the seafood pasta his dish was piled high with seafood usually you only get a couple of each type of seafood but he literally had a plate full i got a free birthday tiramisu and anthony also brought me cute little lemon cookies with candles on them an all around a wonderful experience heard great things about this place but wasnt impressed it took over an hour to get our dinner had simple fettuccini alfredo w chicken it had decent taste but the sauce had the consistency of soup it was so runny i could not eat it w my fork the only place i saw the chicken was on my bill on a good note the bread was good sadly this will make my list of the one and done dont need to try food is ok not too special a little pricey for its value park in valet behind it take elevator straight up to the restaurant best fried zucchini and lemon aioli anywhere this is truly why i come here we were there over an hour and a half just to eat lunch waitress was so slow took between each time we seen her people next to us called over a manager because it took minutes to just get a to go box i think it was more of colette attitude that caused most of the anxiety with everyone she just doesnt know how to multi task we had other servers and manager to fill up our drinks and even to get us a bill however the food is always amazing they just need to work on training i visit las vegas three times or more per year and ever time we have to stop and eat at maggianos it reminds me of some of the old italian restaurants back east its italian comfort food and the service is excellent last year my wife and i celebrated our th wedding anniversary and we booked our dinner at maggianos the waiter was not only attentive but engaging he interacted so well with everybody from my year old mother to my year old grandchildren the food was great again not impressed although my dinner experience was a thousand times better than my solo lunch experience i am not willing though to rate to a higher level as this dinner on many levels fell flat i should have known but kept my hopes up none the less my husband and i were invited to a date night dinner here so we went along for the ride first off service was a tad better this time around our waiter was a bit of an odd ball though i have to give him props for getting me a cocktail in just in time for the happy hour price he was also incredibly knowledgeable about the restaurants extensive menu happily telling us all kinds of things including his opinion of the marsala sauce that is very unlike his italian grandmothers appetizers calamari fritte served with marinara it was fried calamari luckily though it was not soggy or gross it was fried up nicely and with a spritz of lemon and a bit of the sauce was a decent app spinach artichoke al forno i am a fan of artichokes in apps my favorite though it basically just grilling the artichoke and serving it to me as is however i was not impressed with this dip it is baked in an asiago and alfedo like cheese sauce and it just did not have any zing to make it any better than any other spinach dip i have had crab shrimp cannelloni ugh what a waste of money this dish came out in a pool of cheese sauce literally the entire plate was cheese sauce the menu description says this asiago cheese sauce and breadcrumbs no there were no breadcrumbs my plate was a goopy pile of cheese sauce with three lone cannellonis that had perhaps pieces of shrimp the peppers included did not enhance the meal one bit the cannelloni was soggy and unappetizing and the crab meat inside was like a wet mop just smooshy and gross i was incredibly disappointed in this dish i wish i had gotten the spaghetti and meat sauce which is what my husband got and he cleaned his plate creme brulee a huge portion of creme brulee served in a trough okay im just kidding it wasnt served in a trough but it might as well have been the dessert portions are large so ya know share my husband had one spoonful of the creme brulee and i was left to eat the rest of it again as an overall opinion its over priced over salted overly hyped italian food on the strip its a chain italian restaurant i will continue to avoid long wait on a veterans day weekend almost hours wait but the steak was good and the appetizers mozerella marinara and the center cut filet mignon yum sara our server was fantastic we had a large group of people for our wedding dinner i had made reservations weeks in advance they called the day prior to the reservation to confirm and then they called the morning of the reservation date to get my order for the family style dinner i selected from the chefs selection menu lobster baked tilapia chicken parmesan mushroom il fornaio and beef tenderloin medallions for appetizers we selected the calamari caprese and bruschetta for dessert we selected creme brulee and tiramisu absolutely everyone enjoyed everything they ate the meat entrees were all tender and juicy nothing was over cooked or under cooked the food was served timely longest wait was mins between appetizers and entrees the portions and amount of food can be described as abundant the customer service was perfect they allowed us to bring our wedding cake earlier in day and served it at the end of the wedding feast i highly recommend them for special events i ordered take out four cheese ravioli with pesto alfredo i drove home and to my dismay my pasta was covered in marinara i called and the manager answered he was very kind and said he would start the correct order right away he explained the dish is garnished in marinara however i did not read that in the description and dislike tomato sauce as soon as i returned to the restaurant they replaced the pasta i was frustrated i had to drive all the way back but they gave really great service my what a difference a year makes both in how i write yelp reviews and in my maggianos experience i was back at maggianos for a private event and this time it was much better yes they serve the dishes family style yes you pay a slightly inflated price i attribute to the unofficial strip surcharge you get past all that and youll find some good food here on this occasion there was one item that had me going back for more crispy zucchini fritte the zucchini is a diet killer calorie counting yeah forget about that just make sure you get yours before the rest of the table does the rest of the items i tried today were good but there was nothing that warranted asking for a box to take it with me the fettuccine alfredo was respectable not the best ive ever had but it certainly was filling and i sneaked in a second small helping of it the chicken piccata was actually disappointing i masked my disappointment by having more caesar salad and where did that zucchini go again one note to the staff the lemon cookies were too cold but the apple crostada made me forget all about the cookies as this was a business function the maggianos staff took great care of my needs and of everyone that i work with all things considered stars seems appropriate almost forgot to mention one more thing the valet seems super slow here if youre in a hurry to get somewhere else plan accordingly i held my wedding reception at maggianos beth and sabrina were so patient with me and they worked with me to help plan everything im from canada and had no idea who to use for anything that i needed so they gave me a list and i went from there everything was perfect all of my guests were well fed and happy with the event and commented all night on how great the service and food was the family style dinner isnt something anyone had seen at a wedding before and we all thought that was great we were a small group of and we decided to have everyone seated at one long table and that was perfect all in all my wedding was perfect thanks to beth and sabrina and the rest of the staff at maggianos and i couldnt be more thankful came here on a wednesday night at pm with a party of the hostess estimated a wait time of about an hour and mins however we got lucky and got seated in mins because a larger party had just left everything seemed to have gotten off to a good start once we were seated our server was super knowledgeable of the menu which was great also he tailored the service to our party which had kids this was also great however there were certainly some service failures we sipped on water for minutes yes i timed it before our actual drinks came in and he would literally ramble off every single ingredient in the specialty menu before letting us order it was like he was reading a disclaimer off of one of those tv commercials i finally ended up ordering the chicken marsala and the fettuccine alfredo the sauce on the chicken marsala was creamy but watery and the mushrooms were soggy and looked like they had been left in the salamander for too long the fettuccini was also a little tough and the alfredo sauce had texture like mayo not as creamyrunny as it should have been it was chunkier than the marsala overall the atmosphere felt moderately upscale and the servers knowledge accompanied by the however for the price we paid the service and food quality did not meet my expectations i would rate the atmosphere the service and the food quality tip view is great atmosphere is moderately upscale and the service is adequate if youre looking to impress a date this is a great spot however if youre just looking for some great italian food with your family or a large party this is not a good spot for the money tip menu is small and it is periodically updated something to keep in mind just in case you had a favorite my wife and i love this place this is my favorite italian place in vegas the prices are good the food is great we have been here twice both times service was great love the food if you want real food real serving sizes and decent prices come here for your italian food needs went here and it is nice to be able to park and go up the elevator right into the restaurant food was extremely good and the service was excellent the prices were very affordable as well will definitely go back soon hour wait omg the food is good but not hour good people without reservations that came after us were called before we were we had a table of we were so hungry by the time they called us that we ordered a bunch of appetizers mussels mozzarella sticks and calamari the complimentary bread was okay not my favorite type of bread i thought i ordered pasta because i saw pictures on yelp but it wasnt on their menu the shrimp crab pasta on yelp pictures are different than the menus shrimp crab cannelloni it was actually good though crepes filled with cheese crab and shrimp everyone else ordered pasta carbonara and steak everyone liked their food so that was good it was a great experience but the wait is killer this place is crazy busy but the crispy zucchini app was stellar and worth the wait our entree was just ok the linguine di mare probably wouldnt order it again our server really was phenomenal and took great care of us maggianos little italy epic fail last night ok so last night we returned to maggianos little italy restaurant in the fashion show center on the vegas strip expecting our usual fine dining experience but things went badly awry heres how our evening went check in and immediately get seated in a nice booth with a view of the strip so far so good finally get some water hmmm finally asked what we wanted to drink as we already had plenty of time to ponder we immediately gave our entire order bread and olive oil arrive bruschetta and salad finally arrive really minutes for bruschetta and a house salad entrees finally arrive no special requests mind you just the house special wth we ask for our bill and some take home containers so we can head out to our show we sign our bill and head out thank heavens how about the food salad dressing contained some new hotter peppers than previously wife took a few bites and quit bruschetta was good entrees were very disappointing we had our usual rigatoni d a house specialty which is usually excellent not so last night the sauce was so watered down that it wouldnt adhere to any of the rigatoni mushrooms or chicken we had to dunk our bread into it to get any or it just dripped off like water my wife plans to doctor the sauce a bit to make it workable and well try the leftovers tonight hope she can fix it last night maggianos failed badly never had that happen at gaetanos ever guess where were going from now on dean herrington food was ok ambiance way too noisy sitting on top of one another ok if you like that kind of seating major annoyance ordered the bottle of wine and expected to receive carafe at end of evening was told we didnt order enough so well mail it to you later dont really expect to see it ever i love the food here but this experience wasnt as great as it was in the past i made a reservation and when we arrived we were told that there werent any tables available it wasnt even that busy but we waited patiently for about minutes so that wasnt horrible and then our cocktails took at least minutes to arrive at the table once we ordered my soup came out eventually i had two bites and then the entrees came out by the time i finished my soup the cheese on my pasta was no longer hot gross overall it wasnt a terrible experience but the previous times were much better i guess thats why i gave the stars it wasnt terrible just made my eye twitch wow wow wow great food great service great ambiance we were looking for a place to take our father for his th birthday dinner he loves italian though maggianos is a chain this location beats all of the other locations we have visited the waiter nester was terrific we decided to do the classic family style there was almost too much food for all of us each course and entree was delicious calamari was perfect steamed mussels were awesome caesar salad was bountiful and a good palate cleanser before the entrees peppercorn beef salmon chicken piccata and linguine with red clam sauce were all perfect together but remember you have two desserts coming so make some room on this particular evening they had a gentlemen playing the violin he came over and serenaded our father with happy birthday bottom line father loved it all thanks maggianos great atmosphere make sure to park valet on the northeast corner of the mall and take elevator we made reservations and was seated promptly our server seidi was unbelievable and offered great suggestions she made our party feel very welcomed food was great recommendations app zucchini sticks meal chicken parm des tiramisu food was very good i had chicken piccata and hubby had stuffed shells from their holiday menu the stuffed shells were to die for had a frozen bellini which i would recommend will go back next time we visit vegas be careful where you get sat hostess sent us to a long rectangular bar table right behind the hostess stand yet there is no waiter service there as we found out from the three other couples that were in the same predicament after some discussion with manager we got our meal comped all we wanted was pasta to go for the little guy ive been before and had a good visit but this time was no bueno kudos to manager for recognizing the situation we were about to walk out i have being here a couple of times and all experience so were excellent food is delicious atmosphere is great love the complimentary bread fettuccine to die for definitely my place to eat when i shop at fashion show wait was terrible it was friday night after pm and the place was busy we were a party of four our flatbread was cold and placed on a menu on the table dishes not cleared no butter or oil offered brought entree before salad when we asked for more bread he brought pcs for four people not sure if he was mad we didnt order drinks or wine ma ma ma maggianos i sure love you why because you make my tummy happy i have been going to maggianos on and off since the las vegas location opened i had never heard of the chain before because i am not really an italian food fan and tend not to notice those restaurants around town i went here for the first time for a friends birthday dinner a while back and have been hooked ever since before maggianos i was a pasta hater i know i know i am a weirdo but i just wasnt into any pasta i would only eat it if i had to but it was never a first second or third choice for me that was until i had the chicken and spinach manicotti this is in my top dishes ever that very night after eating this dish i kid you not i had a dream about it yes when i have a great meal i will dream about it i still get this dish of the time every time i get it it makes my whole day if i could get away with it in public i would totally lick the plate to get all of the sauce off because i dont want to waste one drop of that awesome alfredo goodness when i do try a different dish i often feel like i am having a food affair and cheating on my precious manicotti yes i love it that much i have tried a few other dishes while having a food affair and they have all been good i really have enjoyed the chicken saltimbocca eggplant parm lasagna and the beef tenderloin medallions i dont think i have ever heard anyone i was with not like one of their dishes yummy yum the kids menu is also fantastic as well the food is awesome adult quality except it is just a little more friendly to a kid palates they have all sorts of pasta options chicken fingers and pizza the kids chicken fingers are ridiculously tasty because yes i steal my kids food on occasion every kids meal is for a big entree dessert and a drink this is a better deal than a lot of restaurants that serve kids mediocre food i love a good deal one good tip i have for you is to make a reservation ahead of time this particular location always seems to be busy no matter what time of day they are on opentable com so making a reservation is super easy if you have never been to a maggianos you should give it a try and of course my recommendation would be the chicken and spinach manicotti the service here is awful it took us an hour to be sat we never it bread it felt like a very uncaring environment the food might be good but i am not sure because it is taking so long to get served that i might die of starvation first i have been waiting so long that i have time to write all this also stingy with the bread and balsamic we visit las vegas between times a year and have never dined at maggianos great place to relax have a delicious bite and not spend a whole bunch of money i had the chicken romano and my boyfriend had the spaghetti and meatball i wanted to trade dishes with him that is the way i enjoy my spaghetti perfect vanessa was our server and she was efficient and friendly only downfall about the visit was the parking lot it was full and confusing better if you walk there we will visit maggianos again for sure i was instantly alarmed when we were seated and i saw food stuck on the empty wine glass in front of me i could hardly place a drink order with the server because i was so fixated on this overlooked problem only compounding the unease we were placed on the edge of the aisle the front legs of my chair were on a carpeted area and the back in the aisle so i always felt like i was about to fall off my chair and this was before the wine our server was curt and lacked warmth i think this may have been the result of me being sucked into the tractor beam of the dirty wine glass when i was ordering we had to ask twice for butter over evoo however we were truly glad this restaurant was open so late most every sit down establishment was was closed except buca and maggianos while it is chain food and has that chain quality frozen it is still filling and occasionally tasty if you are a vegetarian be careful many of the appetizers like the stuffed mushrooms and entrees use chicken stock for flavor which is not posted on the menu we discovered this the hard way ask your server for guidance maggianos receives high marks from us for being open late in this city that seems to close down everything but the casinos after nonetheless the walk to the deserted fashion mall at this hour is truly harrowing we saw no security in this area whatsoever so go in a large alert group seriously friends made reservations here for dinner and i expected the usual high las vegas prices and brusque service i was pleasantly surprised in that the service was excellent and the food was super delicious i tried one of the pasta specialties with chicken and shrimp and it was excellent for only everyone else commented on how good their food was i highly recommend maggianos for a fantastic italian dinner in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere im looking forward to my next dinner there big crowded popular eatery food is good not great but im a food snob girls at reception desk were too busy flirting with guy to greet guests had to wait several minutes till they finally noticed i was standing there ate at the bar jeremy the bartender was fantastic with great service and recommendations husband and i were in las vegas for a mini get away we came here for dinner on sunday night him and i were watching the seahawks vs ers game at the hotel came here at half time and were able to get the perfect seat to watch the rest of the game im not sure if the waitress was training someone new or if the other person that helped was just the bus girl but she was more attentive than the waitress if just the waitress helped us i would have said the service is lacking but since the other lady was there to fill up our drink and bring us menus and take our plates away i would say it was between average and good the food was great i had the mushroom ravioli the sauce was delicious my husband tried it also and thought it was really good my husband had the lasagna he thought it was good the sauce was a little sweeter than i like but it was good overall this is a good restaurant good place to stop for a good meal the prices were reasonable check one of las vegass tour books we saw it after but there was a coupon to get off if you spend i had an amazing time here tonight we had our christmas party and the food was delicious i especially loved the apple crumb with ice cream it was so good it was sinful this place was absolutely great our waiter was attentive and helpful with menu choices and the food was great we were seated right away even though we ended up min early for our reservation i had the linguine with clams in the white wine sauce and my boyfriend had the scrimp scampi his was amazing and they give you about shrimp mine was good but i think the red sauce is probably better it was a little bland so a lot of parmesan helped get the dessert sampler its delicious tiramisu apple crostada and the cheesecake were the best the chocolate cake was really not great and kind of dry and our creme brulee was runny and undercooked overall good prices and good portions for entrees a dessert and a bottle of wine i would definitely come back we got off to a questionable start as we were sat several minutes after our reservation time it was not a deal breaker but it was annoying our server was prompt and friendly the bread is very good it is hard not to fill up on it before your meal comes we ordered a few appetizers for the table i tried the mozzarella marinara it was surprisingly good most places you can tell the mozzarella was pulled from the freezer right before it was fried the mozzarella here had good flavor and the portions are good sized to start off my meal i ordered the side portion of the maggianos salad i always enjoy this salad the house dressing has good flavor the blue cheese and bacon add great flavors too the portion is large for my main course i ordered the veal parmesan the portion is huge it comes with a side of spaghetti as well the veal is ok as far as flavor is concerned i have had better but it was fine wonderful food and service we went there for our wedding rehearsal dinner a few months ago everyone had a great experience we made reservations for and arrived about mins before our reservation so we thought that we might get lucky and get a table early we ended up not getting seated until which we were not happy about because we had show tickets we were so happy with the quality of the food and service provided that the issue with the long wait was no longer an issue we will definitely be returning to the restaurant i went to this restaurant last weekend and had a great experience everything we ordered was great and the service was excellent it had the atmosphere of a very nice restaurant and the prices were reasonable ill definitely be back i always loved going to maggianos while living in la i have to say my most recent visit to the lv location will probably be my last reservations are a must but the bar reception and dining areas are always so packed full of pushy people the wait staff is so stressed out by all the drinks bread meals desserts and checks that they barely have a minute to be cordial i equate maggianos with romance dark setting big booths great music and good food well sadly the place has turned into family heaven there was every age group of child from infant strapped to his dads chest to toddlers in strollers parked in the isle to children throwing tantrums to teens glued to their iphones sorry to say just the sights and sounds of all these children during my meal turned my evening into a spectator event rather than a romantic dinner i suggest keeping the kids with grandma or the babysitter but probably most of the kids we saw were tourists so i think i will just try my luck at a different italian restaurant off the strip a must have my husband and i had the lasagna and the chef manns country style pasta two completely different dishes but both equally delicious and comforting visually beautiful an array of textures and the smell mmmmmm the staff was quick and courteous we hardly waited at all for seating and food we arrived at pm oh and while we didnt take advantage of it this time they offer a nice happy hour menu the food is absolutely amazing our waiter was awesome but the hostesses working tonight are horrible no energy no smiles and they were very rude they made me feel uncomfortable and im sure anyone else would feel the same like i understand you may not be working but youre making money so slap on a smile and fake it these two girls would never survive where i work i would have given it stars but our first server was horrible i wish i could remember his name thankfully he ended up going home after our appetizers and we got a new server the food was delicious and very filling we ordered the family style option and it was way too much food for people we had yummy leftovers though recently visited this place again for the second time the food here is just so damn good mouthwatering dishes i would say also this place has a wonderful view to the strip and very nice customer service a much better and more reasonable priced option on the strip it really captures the essence of an old school italian joint and the food was excellent and reasonably priced with all things considered we ordered the chicken marsala which was to die for as well as a ceasar salad and grilled salmo as far as chain restaurants go this is one of my favorites this particular location is awesome too and i suspect because of its primo las vegas strip location they are all trained to wow you with their service i took the wife and kid here and i was almost ashamed to do so because of the white cloth tables this location seemed just a tad upper class but alas we were hungry wolfpack and i spotted a smattering of kids here so i didnt feel as bad later ordered the bruschetta shrimp scampi and classic spaghetti meatballs all dishes were excellent esp the scampi no complaints here the bruschetta was super tasty the tomatoes and olive oil made me feel like i was in tuscany haha too much yeah service was amazing i didnt get the guys name but it was perfect friendly but not fake attentive but not pyscho deserving of his tip only in vegas right anyway if you got an urge for italian but dont want snotty service at a michelen joint come here after a long and tiring day at magic tradeshow the team came here to feast i was pretty hyped since it was my first time the of us ordered the classic family style which was i believe a person not that cheap but do able service was utterly non existent food took forever inbetween servings were talking about min inbetween each dish even appetizers thats pretty damn bad as you could expect we got full just sitting there so had so much food non taken advantage of maggianos not a good way to treat the customers if i come back and thats a pretty strong if i would hope they actually serve our table meh goodfood la we ended up getting reservations here for our dinner the last time we were in vegas and i am glad we did the service was great i want to say our servers name was nestor but i could be wrong either way great service we had the margherita flatbread to start delicious and our server recommended a dush to me which was amazing it was nicknamed grown up mac n cheese but it was nothing like mac and cheese i rarely ever give a place thumbs up or five star etc etc but the food and service were amazing this place was great my dad loves a good spaghetti and meatballs its his go to favorite meal and me myself i love chicken parmesan we went here when we were visiting my dad in the fall we had a great amazing view of the strip and it was right as the sun going down perfect we all had great food and great service i know its a chain but it was still good to enjoy it and the environment was great hopefully next trip out to vegas to visit me dad we can stop again it was new years day and another visit to maggianos this dinner really started the year off right rustic bread was very good and golden calamari fritte was again excellent alternately dipped in a specially requested lemon aioli along with a mild marinara sauce a filling bowl of tuscan chicken sausage orzo soup was outstanding and a small chopped caesar salad with a light and delicious creamy caesar dressing big crunchy croutons and parmesan splinters was nice and cool although we had to ask for one round of water refills and meat sauce was first mistakenly brought to dianes side of our booth these minor lapses were quickly corrected and otherwise service was excellent as is usually the case here my entree of spaghetti meatball in meat sauce was very fine indeed with a large dense meatball al dente spaghetti and a mild sweet sauce for diane roasted red potatoes served on request in lieu of pasta were simply prepared and excellent tasting i asked for a few mushrooms to be added to my meat sauce and they were there was no charge levied for this or the aioli although i would have gladly paid for these graciously given extras once again five star dining on a holiday when expectations are highest this time they were even exceeded the service was okay had to ask the waiter for a refill on water after waiting nearly minutes the calamari was soggy but the portion was large the tomato and basil soup was eh but the taylor street baked ziti wasnt bad my first time dining at maggianos was in florida a couple years ago i fell in love with it i came back home to vegas and was unaware we had one here until i went to the fashion show mall they never cease to amaze me from their freshly baked bread thats still hot when brought to your table to their absolutely delicious cheese ravioli you cant go wrong dining here our waitress was this super sweet lady who was obviously from a different country i cant remember her name but she was the best couldnt ask for a better server the hostess was a bit off setting she didnt look very happy but ive been a hostess before and i know how stressful it can be a smile will go a long way though this place has certainly changed alot they use to have the best caesar salad and on our visit this past saturday not so good barely had any dressing on it service was also very poor i understand they are very very busy but we waited a very long time to get our bread our waiter had not help from his busser i dont like how you can no longer order small and large food quality has definately gone down we went for dinner and i made reservations on opentable which is super easy we arrived and were seated within a couple minutes the waiter came to the table and we told him that my wife has a gluten allergy and he said that would not be a problem and took our drink order and said he would be back to get our food order when he came back he had the chef who ask my wife what she wanted and said he could make pretty much anything she wanted and she decided on the chicken parmesan which she loved my year old got the mamas lasagna my year old got the fettuccine alfredo and they both thought it was epic i enjoyed my veal parmesan and instead of the spaghetti i asked for the fettuccine alfredo and they said no problem i have to say the food was good but the service was great my wife got the creme brulee for desert which she always enjoys it has become a must visit when we go to vegas theres a maggianos in my hometown of san jose strangely enough i have never been to that place so this was my first time ever at maggianos whoa we pretty much hit the jackpot with parking the underground lot of the fashion show mall has several entrances and although we entered from the south end of the mall we found our way to the northeast corner which was actually near an exit and found a perfect surprisingly non wheelchair parking space very close to the elevator that takes you directly to the back of maggianos after walking through to the host desk at the front we got seated fairly quickly it was a busy lunch hour but not absolutely jampacked we were seated by a window thankfully and we got to see some of the wynn and palazzo i had a blast watching the wynn divider move up and down the led screen who needs a tv i somewhat surprised myself for asking for coffee i was dead tired from accumulate sleep debt this week so it was worth every penny of the our server was funny though he took care to turn the saucer such that the spoon and coffee mug handle were angled to my left even though its kinda assumed that most people including yours truly are right handed i have a lot of love for the baked eggplant parmesan so does my mom she ordered it and saved the leftovers for a special someone along with the stuffed mushroom appetizers my aunt went with the linguini and clams with white clam sauce and i had the veal parmesan just like in most italian restaurants we got started off with complimentary bread with olive oil vinegar dipping sauce nice crust on the outside and soft absorbent inside what more do you want the mushrooms came out first of the orders and they were delicious couldnt care less that basically bread crumbs and fungus with spinach and garlic according to my mom the version she knows from san jose uses a higher number of smaller mushrooms i guess you gotta go big in vegas though and i didnt mind fork and knifing it i thought that the parmesan cheese available table side did enhance the flavor which some might view as a shortcoming i sampled some linguini too its pretty good although the clam to noodle ratio reminds me strongly of ramen in a not that appealing way i like to have more of a balance of protein and starch my veal was nicely pounded breaded and fried and was sufficiently tender as far as that goes the melted provolone and marinara sauce and the accompanying spaghetti were all great complements i just realized that i didnt dust off my leftover veal with parmesan before leaving which makes me a bit sad overall it was good solid italian food one of the best parts really was the view which strongly correlates with the obvious las vegas strip price markups its alright though i would have been hard pressed to spend the in gift cards at another time yay for heavy reductions on out of pocket costs the atmosphere is great the food and wine were very good and we got a great server as well was able to make an online reservation through open table for five people minutes ahead of time on a friday evening which was awesome nous cherchions un petit restaurant ou sarreter un peu plus loin que les grand casinos resultat nous sommes arrive presque au bout du strip devant ce centre commercial il etait deja une heure plutot avance nous avons tout de suite trouve que lambiance de ce restaurant semblais calme et posee exactement ce que nous recherchions nous avons donc dine dans ce restaurant et ce fut vraiment delicieux le tiramisu est le meilleurs que jai pu manger pas trop alcoolise et plein de mascarpone comme je laime la quantite est au rdv et le rapport qualite prix vaut le coup je retournerais a las vegas ne serait ce que pour ce tiramisu the location is perfect to travelers and night view from the window seats is wonderful average food quality is good but some sea food menu such as a linguini di mare are extremely salty i could not eat at all however stuffed mushroom is the best i also like their happy hour drink menu pm very very good food only tried a couple dishes butt they were outstanding and very fresh the pasta seems to be made from scratch which is always a plus and the sauces are not overwhelming very good last night my husband and i was treated to dinner by our kids here at maggianos in fashion show mall and the dinner was great everyone had something different and all the dishes were great my husband who is also a chef had no complaints which is very rare he had clams linguine the sauce was surely a hit with everyone at the table we all sampled each others dishes lol i had the chicken francese the chicken was tender and juicy loved the butter sauce and the crispy potatoes the kids ate lasagna and chicken parmesan both equally good our appetizer was the mozzarella marinara very good sauce the lack of a fifth star was not because of food but the wait we had even with our reservation but with good food you must expect a crowd and the wait was worth it we also had a table with a great view of the las vegas strip came for a bachelorette party dinner there was about in our group and opted for the family style menu we chose the classic menu which came with a choice of appetizer or salad main courses and desserts from what i remember we had the calamari which was amazing the bruschetta which was also amazing and the maggianos salad the salad was pretty good for our main courses we had the chicken parm i was not really a fan of this dish just because if was overly breaded we also had the peppercorn crusted sirloin this dish was really good the meat was tender and the flavors were good along with our meat dishes we ordered baked ziti and fettuccine alfredo i enjoyed the baked ziti but the fettuccine alfredo was too much on the thick side where the noodles clump up together the dessert we chose are tiramisu and creme brulee both were yummy the creme brulee was on the little runny side but it was a really good runny kind there were so much food that we even had tons for left overs everyone enjoyed their food before food coma sets in the service was very very very good the host was able to hold our table even past the min hold time because our party was so late our wait staff was so friendly and soft spoken she was attentive but not annoying she approached our table frequently but not too frequent drinks were refilled before they even reached half way overall it was a great experience i would recommend this place for big groups who has a budget because to be honest restaurants at vegas can get super expensive and not everyone can afford them would i come here again of course i am actually planning on having my family bday dinner at the one in la i found this restaurant by chance as my friends and i were walking down the street from our hotel towards mirage hotel at first we thought it would be very expensive to eat there but since its at the fashion show mall we thought wed stop by and check it out we were pleasantly surprised to see that the prices were pretty reasonable except steaks which cost over i ordered shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta and i loved it it was very light in garlic butter wine sauce and unlike most restaurant they put a generous amount of shrimp in there which was awesome it was a pretty decent sized plate too but i ended up eating every bit of it yumm my friends ordered the lasagna and they both loved it too good portion very meaty cheesy and delicious yes i had to take a bite for myself we ordered a bottle of chianti for i think and it was pretty good and went well with the food if youre planning on having at least glass that would be a better option than ordering by the glass which is usually glass above all our server was really nice friendly and fun i think her name is lori their freshly baked bread was soooo good nice fluffy and warm i am not really a big bread eater especially before my meal but i ended up eating pieces dipped in the olive oil vinaigrette and grated parmesan cheese yumm we didnt have a reservation so we were told we have a half hour wait we were waiting for about minutes but luckily we found a table at the bar first come first serve so we ended up eating at the bar area which was just fine by us they serve the full menu there as well they have a nice outdoor seating area as well id recommend that you call and make a reservation if you have a large group or dont want to wait to be seated sooo next time im in vegas im definitely going back there to try out their seafood linguine went on dinner date on made reservations greeter didnt even acknowledge that we arrived hostess saw that we were uncomfortable as she sat the table too many tables and one restaurant i thought to myself if were with our other table next to us anyways our server stephanie was great very knowledgeable on the menu offered appetizersbruschettaappetizer was out b bar drinks asked for chilled martinis actually came out chilled food was delicious chicken piccata and chicken parmesan stefanie offered us tiramisu as dessert was delightful thank u stefanie for great service very tasty food professional and very courteous waitress chicken parmigiano was excellent strong drinks highly recommended great food amazing atmosphere the portions are very big take that into account when you order i have been to maggianos about different times but this last time warrants some shout outs i graduated and wanted a place to go for my group of friends and family i found out they also have a happy hour thats offered in the restaurant so i made the reservation we were seated right away and our drink orders were taken almost immediately the group decided to participate in the family style dinner we had calamari bruschetta chopped salad chicken parm fettuccine alfredo parmesan crusted tilapia tiramisu and pound cake woooo the best part of our meal was the very attentive and funny jacob he always offered us more food but everything was just enough for our group he kept the drinks a flowing too and made sure this girl was happy happy on her graduation day my husband and i had our wedding reception here and thought it would be special torevisit it for our month anniversary since our original impression was spectacular unfortunately our experience for our anniversary was the complete opposite even though we made reservations our table was on top of the guests behind us the service was virtually nonexistent we had empty glasses we waited about minutes for each course and when finally got our food it was not as satisfying as our original experience needless to say we will not be dining with them again the food and service was great our server rafael was so helpful he made several suggestions that helped us to decide what to order without breaking the bank or over stuffing ourselves we reserved online got there a bit early and got seated within a couple of minutes rafael explained that anything and everything on the menu could be modified to our desire different noodle sauce substitution of an ingredient etc so we ordered the seafood linguine and substituted shrimp for mussels came out totally delicious appetizers were until pm so we ordered italian sausage flatbread delicious we were too full for dessert but wanted a tasted of the tiramisu our favorited rafael suggested the sampler tiramisu for a fraction of the regular price we went for it and were surprised by the still good sized portion again it was perfect rafael also gave us suggestions for tours and shows our experience was fantastic we couldnt stop talking about it to our family and will try maggianos in san jose thanksgiving ruined dont ever ever think about going here for thanksgiving first of all the food was terrible over salted just awful second they ran out of food or perhaps do not know how to plan well third they ran two hours late for our confirmed reservation ridiculous ran out of proscuitto for their own maggianos salad they obviously were running low on food by the time we were seated reservation seated at for seven adults they place two ice cream scoops of mashed potatoes on a small plate in the center of the table for seven people then the turkey platter looked like a sad plate of leftovers and had one little mound of stuffing which was gone after it was passed to the second person we kept thinking that was decoration and they would bring some in a bowl aka family style same for the ham platter one little scoop of sweet potatoes for seven adults the pasta course however was abundant apparently the only thing they know how to cook they brought two big bowls of pasta for side dishes everything was horribly over salted the gravy also they must have been running out of was a tiny little coffee cup sized dish of milky white looking blah gravy i cannot repeat enough it was horrible two ten year olds could pull together a better turkey dinner they have a lot of nerve charging per person great food however this place doesnt build its business off of customer service if you have any special request forget about it they dont have to worry about repeat customers in a location like this doesnt matter to them that you are spending a nice good amount of money to take your family out for a nice evening we asked if we could sit on the patio no even tho plenty of tables can we sit by the window vegas if you want to wait min again plenty of open tables guess what theres a lot of other great restaurants in vegas very flavorful food and very reasonably priced for italian portions are big you never leave feeling hungry highly recommend my all time favorite italian restaurant a must have is rigatoni d a few other recommendations are four cheese ravioli beef medallions and the spinach and artichoke dip beautiful restaurant and very busy make reservations on a weekend have been to this restaurant multiple times made a pm reservation and was seated promptly when arrived my friend and i had the calamari app rustic chicken pasta and veal parm everything delcious even saved room fro teh tiremisu desert which is probabaly one of the best tiremisus i ever eat assad our waited was on top of things the whole time made sure we always had everything we wanted and very friendly i will ask for him next time i go only reason didnt give it star is because the items are just a tad bit pricey i think i have noticed the prices inch up little by little every tiem i visit but since this is a vegas strip location they can do this i guess since more tourists than locals go here classy atmosphere and easy to get in i love the veal parm expensive but worth it if you have a bunch of friends come in from out of town take them here and then go hit the casinos afterwards i got really lucky at the venetian after a meal at this restaurant its good luck restroom needed some touched up on the way to restroom passing by bar area paper towel on the floor displayed look unsanitary plate for bread needed to be checked under for remains of food sticked in it presentation love love love this place atmosphere is amazing food is always great highly recommend to locals and tourist the food was good maybe just a little salty but ive come to expect that from large chains and our service was good but seated next to us was a group of four something men three of whom were wearing wife beater tank tops it was really disgusting i dont expect suits and ties and i guess these days in las vegas even a collared shirt is asking for too much but wife beaters it was gross i find it hard to believe that maggianos doesnt have some minimum dress standards ill probably go back again one of these days but if i see that again ill leave good italian food for decent prices spacious and attentive service highly recommend trying the patio its shaded and if its not too hot out should be a nice experience fried calamari oven roasted pork loin chicken parm and tiramisu are a must i ate here with my family and it was a great experience the wait staff was very friendly and their reservation system is very efficient i put in my reservation at and they had us seated before even though the place was packed their food is great too we got calamari easily the best ive ever had stuffed sausages and mussels as appetizers and types of pasta as part of the group menu deal dessert was some tasty cookies there was a friendly old man not sure if he was staff or someone they hired to come in sometimes singing to couples and people who had birthdays at one point the whole restaurant sang happy birthday to this guy with fake elvis muttonchops the atmosphere was very comfortable i highly recommend this place and i will definitely eat here again second time to this maggianos the first time we sat on the patio and i swear a cockroach bit my leg soooooo gross i dont think thats the restaurants fault the interior appears very clean came here for dinner the other night to meet up with a friend at pm but hadnt called to make a reservation my boy and i got there a little early so we put our name down wait was mins nbd and took a seat at the bar the bartender took a minute to get to us but was friendly and made an awesome drink for me moscato mojito definitely try it within minutes our buzzer went off for our table i brought it over with my still nearly full drank drank but had to wait like more minutes at the stand to be seated i get that it was much faster than the minute prediction but dont tell me my table is ready then make me wait again while with a drink in hand whatev we were seated our server said hed be right with us our server came back and took our drink order we ordered of those moscato mojitos one extra for our late friend lol im telling you try it our friend showed up shortly after and we got our drank dranks server asked if wed decided on our meals yet our friend just sat down give us like more minutes ok cool he came back like minutes later with bread and oil we ordered and asked for vinegar to go with the oil he never brought it meanwhile the table next to us had sat down minutes after us and was being served their food again i get that we were taking our time and our friend was late whatev but their server was on it i was able to get his attention and asked for vinegar it took him seconds i was so jealous of the table next to us food finally came like minutes later and i was a little disappointed with the size of the salad that my boy and i agreed to share because it was enough for two maybe enough for two kids my ravioli and side of broccolini were really good tho our server came back minutes later to ask if we needed anything i was gonna get a dessert but after waiting forever for our meal and having never gotten vinegar from him i decided to pass fearing it would take too long just the check thanks ugh that was another minute ordeal i dont recall him thanking us or looking forward to our next visit but that may have been said overall stars only cuz our service was slow and spotty memorable i suppose but not for the right reasons food was good nothing to write home about but satisfying dranks were bomb ill go back just for that moscato mojito better luck next time though maggianos first time here last night and had a great experience our server did a fantastic job in my opinion she was very attentive and personable she wasnt overly formal which is a weird pet peeve of mine our waters were always full drinks refilled and table clean onto the food we started with the zucchini appetizer which was all kinds of amazing they were lightly dusted with parmesan cheese and served with a lemon aioli of some sort very delicious my boyfriend thought they had a little too much batter but i thought they were perfect we asked for a side of marinara or meat sauce with the app and our server gladly brought us a little of both they too were very good very different from each other which i thought was nice i ordered the chicken francese i think thats how its spelled with angel hair pasta instead of the potatoes it was a lemon chicken with a parmesan crust and what i would describe as a light creamy mushroom sauce idk but it was good not too lemony or heavy on the sauce and the perfect portion i saved one chicken breast to take home because i wanted some later my boyfriend ordered the rigatoni d which he was really disappointed with it had an odd sweet flavor to it we took most of it home with us and never touched it after that overall it was a good experience i definitely will be back to try something new we recently went here for lunch the food was awesome and delicious our waiter was courteous and extremely efficient portions and drinks were huge highly recommend i honestly feel that this place was overrated i always get people that tell me that this place was awesome which i dont agree its also overpriced for what they give you a dinner for two here is a hundred bucks i feel like i can get more for my money somewhere else sorry to be blunt but i eat out alot so if im going to spend that kind of money i should feel satisfied right its safe to say im a maggianos regular i think the vegas location is probably the best one overlooking the strip yet safely located in the fashion show mall not quite on the strip fun for people watching during the day love sitting outside if not too cold hot or windy then transforms at nite when the windowed walls facing the strip allow you to dine alongside the buzz beauty of the vegas lights while ambiance is a factor in why i like maggianos consistency is the reason i go back time time again i dont believe ive ever had a bad meal or experience there other than occasionally being sardined on busier nites unbeknownst to me at some point maggianos even changed ownership i couldnt tell because unlike other cases when theres an ownership change nothing about the quality changed im part of their email list so i get emails with coupons every couple months a few no fails on the menu tomato caprese stuffed mushrooms rigatoni d though not great for leftovers because of the cream sauce moms lasagna had it for the st time last nite its one of the best not too mushy eggplant parm generous portion the best chicken parm ive ever graced my mouth with linguine di mare substantial seafood for dessert if youre still feeling gluttonous go for the apple crostada otherwise we generally get the kids scoop of vanilla bean icecream with hot fudge also keep maggianos in mind for thanksgiving christmas dining if youre in town visiting or if you just dont feel like cooking they do a wonderful job with the menus youll surely have leftovers for a reasonable price its easy to mosey in be seated right away for lunch but i recommend reservations for any time after tried the saltimbicca chicken and it was like nothing i have ever tasted the dish was full of flavor sage and other herbs tender perhaps pounded in a perfect mix of sauce wow i normally go with the tenderloin medallions but glad that i ventured from the beef route oh and the bread addictive so delicious the food is really good i had the rigatoni d and chicken picatta it was delicious the reason for the stars was the service the waiter was trying really hard but they were super busy it was just to much for him or anyone but worth a try just make sure to have a reservation upon check in oh and the view is amazing not a bad chain restaurant with a bit of a hometown feel portions are generous prices reasonable and service is friendly makes this an acceptable place to go in the northerncentral part of the strip fashion show mall ordered the linguine di mare seafood its a decent dish with mussels shrimp bits of lobster with pasta in a tomato based sauce its a huge portion but whats up with the tons of mussels extreme dis portion of mussels which is more than half of the seafood i like mussels so thats ok with me others may not be so happy the noodles need to be cooked longer in the broth as the flavors are not completely absorbed for desert ordered the tiramisu very light and creamy with a strong coffee accent this would be a good choice we ate there during our last trip to vegas i loved their eggplant parmesan nick our server was great we ate outside on the patio the service was great the manager even stopped by to ask us how our food was i loved their mist outside to cool us during the hot weather they dont offer the take one home meal like all other maggianos i couldve used it nevertheless a great experience highly recommended very good comfort food with all the regular italian fare youre accustomed to this isnt going to be anything out of the ordinary but if youre looking for a good solid place to take a group while youre visiting the strip this is it great views and patio seating is available a coworker recommended this place and i am sure glad she did after a long day of travel this place really hit the spot the patio was nice in the evening and not too loud with street traffic the calamari was delicious as we the mushroom tortellini and eggplant parm the food was rich delicious and flavourful as very well priced especially on the strip the sangria pitcher was a little disappointing though it had a ton of ice and the server put a ton of ice in our glasses as well it really diluted the flavour so impressed we were here for my husbands birthday dinner and everything was amazing we ordered filet mignon and the lobster carbanara our food came to our table hot i hate when it comes to you warm or semi warm i dont want it sitting in a window we also tried the calamari it was the best we have ever had our waiter assad was great our drinks always filled and overall great service jhe even brought my husband a small bday dessert portions are huge food is fresh prices are good we wiill be back we are locals visit maggianos regularly the food is always great we love the location the atmosphere nicely priced also maggianos is a very nice restaurant the service was excellent the food was very appetizing theres plenty to eat when you order a family style meal with a party of or more will come back again i recommend this place to everyone visiting the las vegas strip i visited this place a couple of years ago on the recommendation of my friend missy she loves the newport location so i was willing to try it out amazing i make it a point to east here when in vegas this might sound strange but they have one of the best crab cake appetizers in the world i have ordered this as my main course and nibbled on my husbands food on a few occasions the portion size is huge we have done the family style meal and it was simply too much food we could not keep up all in all the location is nice the food is great and the location is convenient maggianos is a good place the service is great the food is appetizing my boyfriend and i enjoy sitting in the outside area with the strip view we always have a few cocktails and share some good food and people watch great place to spend an afternoon we dined here last night with a party of ordered the family style dinner and were very impressed brandon took very good care of us the whole night we were never rushed and the food just keep coming the chopped salad was great along with the stuffed mushrooms dinner was eggplant parmesan salmon chicken picata and sausage with gnocchi which all were excellent one of our diners had some dietary issues and they were very attentive to her dessert was amazing my favorite being the apple pie everyone in our party was very impressed maggianos is a family atmosphere restaurant with a good location great food and excellent service if youre looking for that restaurant where you want to fell comfortable with the whole family this is it i come here every time im visiting vegas with my four years old daughter of course she knows how to behave in a restaurant the location is perfect specially if youre planning to do some shopping since is located right there at the fashion show mall and if youre lucky you might get a table with a nice view of the wynn and encore casinos across the strip the food is great some of my favorites entrees are the lobster carbonara the rigatoni d and the chicken manicotti all good and the portion of food is more than enough the excellent service is based on my last visit i made a pm reservation but we arrived about minutes earlier vegas traffic unpredictable i asked them if we could be seated and in less than five minutes we were already enjoying ourselves nestor was the name of the waiter he was there when needed with suggestions of appetizers wine and desserts simply great service attempted to book maggianos for a wedding rehearsal dinner dealt very briefly with the booking coordinator named lori who was so unprofessional that i would not have booked this venue even if it was the last restaurant in las vegas i am a local business owner and i am shocked at how a restaurant like maggianos handles their guests extremely disappointed since i have used maggianos in the past for graduations etc we love maggianos little italy we used to go to the one at south coast plaza it is awesome but now that we have moved we are closer to las vegas maggianos is at fashion mall across from wynn they do a great job even being crowded food and service are great you can park right under the mall and there is an elevator to take you to italian heaven i cannot rave about this place enough i only ever get to a maggianos on vacations this time did not disappoint we went with a party of and had the family style experience chopped salad crab cakes and gnocchi with sausage to name a few dishes everything was perfect wait staff was pleasant a violinist came to our table and even took some unusual requests great experience a must try i have always been a fan of maggianos i first went to one of their establishments over years ago in chicago and have gone to that one probably ten times since when they opened one in las vegas i was happy to go there as well and have frequented it many times since then maggianos is one of those rare restaurants that overfeeds you meaning they serve huge servings which is very hard to usually finish unless youre super hungry on our most recent visit we got spaghetti and meatballs shrimp scampi chicken piccata sauteed spinach and mashed potatoes as usual my family had a hard time devouring all the food my niece was overwhelmed by the huge serving of shrip scampi as was my son with the spaghetti i was just able to finish off my dish of chicken piccata needless to say that we are fans of maggianos and it is always on our list of restaurants to visit when in vegas based on a recommendation from some good friends my wife and i gave this place a try a few years back and every year we make sure this restaurant is a part of our annual vegas trips the service is always stellar and friendly the prices are decent as well the portions are perfect for sharing and you just cant help but savour the wide range of flavour each dish presents itself there is both a subtly and boldness with each pasta dish we leave full and content but not bloated and overstuffed like you can at some pasta places in some ways this is a nice escape from the fashion show mall the views from the restaurant are wonderful as you sit across the wynn and the places offers a bit of calm from the strip itself i have had a few dishes here over the years and so far each one has been wonderful try something yourself as i am confidant that you will experience the flavours and enjoy the atmosphere as much as we do each year pretty solid place everything from the service to the lobster carbonara were very satisfactory and thoroughly filling i would definitely be back and recommend the place to others the portion i took to go for the next day held up as well good stuff the food was amazing we had the spaghetti and meatball and could not be happier the only reason i wont give stars is that our waiter was horrible we sat for a good minutes without him refilling any drinks or taking our order but we requested another waitress and sarah was amazing she more than made up for the lack of service if everyone was like her it would be a star for sure when it comes to italian this place is my favorite in vegas great place to take a date or your whole family please be smart and make reservations because with quality food like this there will be many people there lets talk about some of my favorite things to order right from the start the warm bread basket is fantastic please enjoy the top notch virgin olive oil and the best balsamic vinegar i have ever had some of my favorite appetizer are bruschetta a simple but very tasty plate the chopped salad or any of their salads are great and large enough to share and though i personally am not a fan of calamari my grandma and fathers side of the family who are sicilian i may add rave about it and order it every time we go as for main course you cant go wrong with any of their pasta dishes which i can almost guarantee you will have some left over to take home my favorite though it is another simple classic dish is the spaghetti and meatballs i absolutely love it the chicken parm is fantastic as well in all honesty their are more great dishes here than i can name in this review now for desert if you were able to save room go for it or you can be like me and get a piece of tripple layer chocolate cake to go it is extremely rich and very well made the cheesecake is very good as well i strongly reccomend this restaurant and as i said in the beggining it is one of the better places to take a date especially if you want to impress once again please make reservations for less wait time but if there is a little wait they have a great little bar area you can grab a few cocktails relax and socialize also as i said dont limit this place to only dates its great for the whole family with large portions attentive wait staff and a lot of class stars and truley a gem enjoy darn good italian food probably some of the best italian food ive had since i left ny other than waiting an hour to be served and a long hike to get there worth the wait and exercise staff was good and fast especially the english talking waitress music was frank sinatra like and there was even a guy walking around asking to sing personalized music looks like ill be having my wedding reception here lets see forgot to mention i was even watching the orioles play and talking to my wife to be as well she actually thought i was listening to her what a bonus very delicious italian food great views of the strip get a table by the window could do without the random serenade guy walking to every table to get tips for singing to you but it is a unique touch very enjoyable experience in all ive actually been to maggianos a few times and when i did it was amazing the food the atmosphere the service was phenomenal however this review will be on my recent visit just a couple days ago me and my boyfriend decided to go for lunch here to celebrate on him getting a potential new job in the beginning everything was fine we ordered our appetizers and that was it he didnt ask if wed like an entree after taking down our appetizers so we waited for our server to come back and ask if wed like to order an entree after he gave us our appetizer and even finished it all we saw him do was helping every other customers but us did he have something against us because we look years old and cant afford an entree after about minutes of waiting we asked another server to ask him if he can take down our entree weve been waiting for he comes over and he goes okay go ahead he didnt apologize for making us wait really wow im appalled by his performance and after we got our entree he only came over to us twice third time being check and we never saw him again the saving grace to our experience was the food our appetizers were the zucchini fritte and stuffed mushrooms i loved how crunchy the zucchini was and the soupy base for the mushroom was great our entrees were the rigatoni d and chicken parmesan he enjoyed his parmesan very much and the rigatoni was very fulfilling and the cream sauce complimented the whole dish so well the little mushrooms in it was too cute to eat were always going to come back here just not have that older server again i am giving this restaurant stars because i was in a larger party under ppl but the forgot one of the orders they did comp that meal but if youre hungry and ready for dinner it sucks to have to wait my meal came out on time and it was delicious i had the chicken francese i loved it pretty filling and not too heavy which i appreciated since i was going to go out later that evening i love pasta but lets face it its heavy i would definitely visit this location again good servers and good food remember if the party is too large they make you dine family style just another chain restaurant caesar salad and the food server at the table dropped the balsamic oil which splattered on my new shoes it was ok italian food but ive had better the pasta was uninspiring the family style dinner is a really good bargain highly recommended for a group i found this place on yelp years ago and every time i intend on coming it never happens today i made sure it was the first thing we did her shrimp scampi for her with vodka cream sauce angel hair pasta with a tomato soup peach ice tea her remarks were this is the best vodka shrimp pasta i ever had shes had it in a lot places lol me chicken marsala with angel hair with chunky spicy tomato sauce stella artois my thoughts this was def killed olive gardens version of it lol everything was great also dessert sampler was also epic nicole was very nice and had a lot of menu knowledge thank stars my first time here at maggianos and i have to say the service is great i had the moms lasagna and enjoyed every bite also the portion size is big enough to feed two we thoroughly enjoyed our meal here we were able to get a seat quickly bread service was my favorite part balsamic vinegar in olive oil to dip the bread yummy i had the fettuccine alfredo while my husband had chicken parmesan huge portions that we had wrapped up for later our daughter inhaled her ravioli included in her kids meal was ice cream instead of shouting out about the ice cream in front of our daughter our fabulous server asked my husband discreetly if it was ok for her to have it loved that price was decent food was terrific service was fabulous definitely recommend we went to maggianos to have dinner after a wedding the room had been reserved in a beautiful private wine room the food was delicious the service by bob and jeremy was outstanding they even brought in a ipod with music so the bride and groom could have a first dance i highly recommend this place i am from san diego and i cant wait to go back again you have to try the maggiano salad this had to be the most delicious salad i have had in a long time and i am not a salad person the peach bellini is delicious the homemade bread was excellent i got the bow tie aglio chicken special which was good but a cream sauce really would have made the dish better the orecchiette and scallops are excellent i used to like maggiano and think it was one of my favorite italian chain place however i have not been back to this place for at least years because there are so many italian restaurants in town i came back last night for my friends bday and found out theyve changed their menu quite a bit i guess my palate has changed as well and became more picky i wasnt completely satisfied i was surprised that they dont have any pesto sauce on any dish they also took always the half full size they only have one size for their entrees now where its more for individuals rather than sharing i guess that makes more sense for the restaurants on the profit sides after i sat down it took the server minutes to bring me some water and then another or minutes to take my drink order even though i was the only one who arrived in our table i was bit annoyed by it the server was friendly though i wasnt sure if they were under staffed or hes just keep forgetting about me i was not impressed by any of the pasta we tried we tried fettuccine alfredo gnocchi and italian sausage and shrimp scampi alfredo sauce was not creamy enough i like the vodka cream sauce in gnocchi but gnocchi was overcooked i dont think i will return anytime soon rigatoni d never disappoints as well as the flat breads cant beat the happy hour yummmm best italian food in southern nevada hands down ask for marcos meal deal to get pastas and dessert at a discount locals ask for the take one deal so you get a free take home pasta its like for and the nd pasta can be different from the one you eat in store the singer is great and the bread is fresh came with a big group of and enjoyed lunch very much everyone liked it they put bread on the table with olive oil and balsamic vinegar the bread was very good crispy outside and soft center i ordered the lobster carbonara the pasta was cooked al dente as it should be the sauce was creamy and tasty it has pea pods instead of single peas which i liked better anyway there was plenty of big chunks of lobster throughout and only a few pieces were the opposite salty bitter side of the claw too many restaraunt slip those pieces in instead of the sweet delicious side of the claw not this place plenty of real sweet lobster yum a little pricey but the portions are huge atmosphere elegant and wait staff superb so worth it the service was excellent and as always the food is very good the server always refilled the glasses and the good came out quick at the end of the meal grab a few of the mints they are awesome first of all the mints were delicious they sat us where we wanted to sit in a very short amount of time the food was tasty and the service was great the drinks were refilled in a timely manner and so was the bread we had a great view of the strip again i grabbed a handful of mints on my way out lol took wifey and little one out on a lunch one afternoon after strolling in the mall i finally decided to check this place out for what it really is i ordered the lobster carbonara while wifey got the steak with mushroom for lunch as for her dish she said she loved it the mushroom gravy was very rich and being the fact that she loves mushroom it was all worthit from her aside from me who is not a mushroom eater lol as for my lobster meal it was an excellent dish little one and i shared it and the portion is huge for a lunch meal so two person can share it if theyre not that hungry stars for the food and minus for the service it was very slow i needed refill but the waiter never seem to care and just kept passing us by i loved everything about my visit minus the waitress although she wasnt horrible i ordered the famous rigatoni d which was delishhh i will definitely be coming back on my next trip to vegas my wife and i had a great meal here its not like we make at home but we were very happy with it portions were large and the price was great two entrees and a glass of wine were only our server nick could not have been nicer no complaints about this place so first off i enjoyed their outside seating area they were very quick to sit us down on a saturday night were quick to get our drink order and it quicker with our food the calamari for appetizer was glorious i had the lobster carbonara and i absolutely loved it keep in mind there actually big portions so i wasnt able to finish it got a to go box for sure you dont let good things like that go to waste my friend got the ravioli he was pleased with but seemed like a smaller portion it had like six or seven or so raviolis seem to fill him up though bread they brought out with the balsamic was amazing i now want to go to the store and do that for myself i very much enjoyed this last night and intend on going back today i went to hooters for lunch and even though im stuffed from it i have the lobster carbonara in my fridge i refuse to go bad so thats what im eating now im a fat ass went here on a friday afternoon for lunch wait time was not bad in fact we were seated fairly fast greeted by everyone when we walked in so no complaints on friendliness place was clean and well orginized ordered chicken fettuccine alfredo with asparagus great flavor mushroom ravioli so so overal this place to me is comparable to olive garden nothing too mind blowing or distinguishing would much rather pay the price at a tony romas customer service was better than expected not a bad try at all love their lighter fare option while yes maggianos is known for their large portions and ahem rich calorie laden flavors this was a nice surprise i had the chicken piccata and thoroughly enjoyed it i didnt think any of the flavor was lost but yes the portion was a bit smaller than what im used to there however it was still filling hubby had the linguini de mare which was really good not lighter fare we started with the maggiano salad him and italian salad me and both really enjoyed our respective orders we shared the toasted pound cake with caramelized bananas for dessert and it was deeeelish our server was seidi and i highly recommend asking for her section we eat out quite often and the service we experienced from her was the best weve had in a while awsome awsome awsome everything we had was wonderful one of my favorite dishes is cannelloni and they have now set the bar please do yourself a favor and try this place out dont forget the tiramasu to finish it all up we will return the next time in vegas the service was phenomenal our waiter was perfectly pleasant witty and attentive the food was incredibly delicious and the pricing was very reasonable be prepared for a considerable wait without reservations but i would highly recommend for anyone visiting the las vegas strip honestly the food is stars the service was fast friendly but i knocked it down to stars because of the atmosphere we went in planning on having a romantic dinner for our anniversary and instead its like we walked into a big family dinner party and it maybe fun for some i found it a bit overwhelming soon as we walked in we had to walk through the dining room maze and to the middle of the crowded restaurant which is expected at pm saturday night but it was the layout that just crams everyone together unless youre in a booth its pretty much like youre eating with the other tables next to you it was so loud that i had to shout over to have a conversation with my hubby it wasnt loud music it was just having so many people in one room talking even the guy who serenaded us with a guitar i could barely hear and he was right in front of me as for the food awesome i got the lobster carbonara and it was delish lots of lobster cream sauce was tasty and huge portion only complaint is a little too much parmesan cheese that it kinda hides the flavor of the sweet lobster hubby had chicken alfredo and loved it but couldnt finish it rarely happens got the sampler for dessert and its must if you cant decide on one thing overall not a bad place for good italian food with family friends but definitely dont recommend for romantic dates great place to eat the only thing that keeps this a four star review is that our waiter is never around we were seated at the patio nice outdoor area overlooking the entrance of the mall and after putting down our menus he didnt return eventually one of the hostess took our order for us our food eventually came but we were not given any utensils and our water was not refilled throughout our meal that aside the food is very delicious and reasonably priced i love their pasta and they have cheap pasta options or nicer seafood pasta options im a big fan of cheese so the i love the meal here arguably better than the buffet options on the strip which costs too much good solid italian food we had eaten here once before again with some of our kids the food was very good as described in the menu except the dressing on the salad was extremely salty we all agreed that if we ordered that salad again no dressing or on the side the prawns in their signature red sauce were generous in portion size and excellent the calamari fritti sp were also very good the wine list while not huge had some very good values service was a bit uneven though always friendly and apologetic with regard to forgotten items would eat here again but order a bit different the food was so good and authentic one of the best italian food i eaten highly recommended everything was better than i expected jeremy and bob made our small wedding reception so special my husband and i could not have asked for more the arrangements and the barolo room were perfect for our family and friends we were all impressed by the wonderful food and atmosphere we would do it all over again and again we will definitely be back for many anniversaries thanks to everyone my husband and i had lunch here this afternoon we both had moms lasagna mine with marinara my husbands with meat sauce it was amazing the homemade lasagna noodles were delicate not chewy the sauce was extremely flavorful we will make this a must stop on every trip to vegas from now on the customer service was excellent we were sat and the waiter was very friendly the bread was soft and delicious i ordered the four cheese ravioli and the flavor was a bit bland but i added some more seasoning to get it where i wanted not sure if ill be back but if i need a italian spot i dont mind coming here we made our reservation on open table and walked over from the trump we were seated right away the service was very good while we were walking to our seats we noticed the portions were very generous my wife and i split a salad an a meal and it was more than enough some might think it was cheesy but my wife and i thought the strollling guitar player was a nice vegas touch let me start by saying we sat at the bar because the restaurant was very busy and ere glad we did outstanding service to the food i had chicken shrimp al forno it was outstanding my hubby had the lobster carbonara nothing left on his plate and he also finished mine no room for dessert but the people next to us had cheese cake and look delicious great italian food great service what more do you need ordered the family classic style to share between four of us there was wayyy too much good food to share i was stuffed before the desserts even came out not sure if you are allowed to bring food home or not considering the family style menu you can keep asking for more as much as you want but our waiter was nice enough to let us take the desserts home this place can be on the pricey side but you get what you pay for great food and great service highly recommend the staff and service where decent what really really lacked was the food its self maybe growing next to little italy in nyc has me spoiled because that food is cooked by real italians not the best place to go if youre trying to eat healthy haha but when its a friends birthday and u kind of have to go the restaurant does offer lighter fare options and glutten free options my gripe was not being provided with correct nutritional information i feel like i annoyed the guy when i asked and my food was good just tasted kind of salty ehhh ill try it again tho someday i really wanted to love this restaurant but i didnt my husband and i were craving italian food while on vacation in vegas this place didnt do it the service was slow the appetizer and bread were delicious but the entrees were not i swear my eggplant parm tasted freezer burnt hubbys lasagna was just ok our server was bad i could easily hear him use the same line to sell dessert to all of his tables maybe the dessert was good but i wasnt buying it save your for another restaurant last night was me and my boyfriends last night in vegas we asked our server corinna what was her favorites and she told us the beef madalions and lobster pasta cant remember the name omg died and went to hevan after the frisf bight beef was soo tender didnt need a knife and pasta was so cheesy and delish plus you get warm rolls with butter and vinegar and oil sk as the dinner came to an end we had left overs so she boxed them up for us and put in free lemon cookies all around best service thank you corinna one of the best locations on the strip if you go for dinner ask to sit in the main dining room floor to ceiling windows facing encore the wynn for lunch i prefer the bar especially if there is a game on today a couple of glasses of pinot and the soup sand chicken meatball killer do it maggianos las rocks park underneath at fashion show i really cannot give this place any stars except for one and that was because the server went above and beyond the food was horrible the calamari was left under the heat lamp and was chewy why so much iceberg in my salad we had chicken marsala and the chicken was so over cooked that i couldnt chew it we had a fish course and although the fish was cooked perfectly it was luke warm all in all the experience was not what i would have expected next time i choose to drive that far for italian ill pay a little more and go somewhere else after reading reviews we decided to book my sisters wedding cocktail reception at maggianos in vegas it was one of the best decisions we made working with beth assistant banquet sales manager was awesome we emailed back and forth prior to our october th reception she was easy to get a hold of and very helpful we had people attend the reception they put us in the dicarlo private room we decided to go with the hour reception all you can drink appetizer food menu you cant beat the price beth asked how would we like the room sit up i told her that majority of the people will be standing around socializing but i wanted the options for guests to sit we had high tables and low tables for people to sit worked out perfect we arrived a little early so we made our way to the bar which was large when the married couple arrived they felt special that their name was on the board when they came in when you walk into maggianos it is very elegant the severs for our party i forgot their names but they were excellent the drinks were flowing and the food was coming out our guests are drinkers and probably were very needy i never felt the servers were annoyed they were in a good mood and accommodated us they were very nice too the food was amazing no one complained thank you chefs maggianos allowed us to have a dock station to play our own music since no one was in the other private room we were able to go on the balcony to make toast and and take pictures the balcony is awesome i actually wish the party was out there the manager stopped by at the end of the night to see how everything went we couldnt have thanked him more for an unforgettable wedding reception our friends and family are still talking about how they enjoyed the wedding reception i especially recommend maggianos in vegas for a wedding reception i cant wait to come back and get dinner here our server was absolutely incredible he was very attentive to our needs and kept an amazing conversation with us the food was delicious as well i had the ravioli and my husband had the chicken marsala we will definitely be returning i love their bread too the mussels in the spicy tomato sauce was superb as well as the shrimp scampi the desert sampler was five ok the best i have had our waiter brandon was wonderful helped with suggestions recommend this place highly the atmosphere in this place is quite nice very low lighting it seems great for big family events with a number of big private rooms its great because you have a perfect view of the lights and hustle of the las vegas strip i ordered to go but had a glass of wine while i waited for my food to finish the servers seemed really nice for the most part although i didnt get the full service since i was ordering to go i ordered the shrimp fra diavolo lighter version with a side casear salad the food was packed very nicely and thoroughly saran wrapped to keep from spilling the salad was ok nothing too extravagant the pasta was a nice portion perfect to get full off of and then have leftovers for another meal also they were very generous with the shrimp sadly some of the shrimp tasted a little undercooked i wasnt sure but the next morning when i was sick it was confirmed definitely may think twice before ordering seafood here had such a great first experience at maggianos our server nicole was amazing we wanted to eat somewhere before our show at the wynn we knew that it was our own fault for running a little behind but when nicole found out that we were on a time limit she made sure that they had everything out for us in a timely manner without us having to ask her we were not expecting that at all she gave us suggestions on what to order and what not to order since certain items take longer to make she kept checking up on us and our waters were always filled portions are big family style is an option as well so we ended up ordering an appetizer one pasta dish and then dessert soooo good we will be back one of my top fav restaurants food is always full of flavor the bread is amazing our servers are always checking up on the table and even on a busy night i can still sit down and have a comfortable dinner with whomever i go with always a top choice when im debating where to go eat for dinner very delicious food i ordered the caesar salad and chicken franchese wife ordered the house salad and chicken alfredo light style both dishes were cooked perfectly and was tasty the complimentary bread was also fresh and good this place was absolutely amazing out waiters name was dave he treated us so well answered all of our questions and gave us amazing recommendations we ate the stuffed shells spaghetti and meatballs and lasagna and it was spectacular the food came out so fast and we were starving i will definitely be back to this place very soon my friends i had a very pleasant dining experience here when they rented out one of the private rooms at maggianos as the lunch reception for their year wedding vow renewal we had tables that seated about people there was plenty of room for a display table as well and there was also an adjacent balcony with a view of the strip encore they had a specially tailored menu with their names on it as well as at the door upon entering the room we had to correct them on the spelling when we arrived they corrected it before the families arrived overall the service and the experience was a positive one i think its safe to say the guests celebrants enjoyed their time at maggianos id advise you to valet outside because the elevator by valet takes you right up to restaurant my friend that lives in town gave me that nugget of information so convenient now on to the menu first course was stuffed mushrooms calamari italian salad the stuffed mushrooms were good they were big mushrooms and it was stuffed with spinach and bread crumbs they were served in a white wine sauce you cant go wrong with calamari and their version didnt disappoint fresh tasting pieces of breaded squid accompanied with marinara sauce for dipping just squeeze some lemon over the calamari and youre golden the italian salad was surprisingly delicious salad had arugula lettuce pepperoncinis croutons in italian dressing good appetizers i enjoyed every single one of them second course consisted of meat lasagna rustic chicken shrimp and chicken marsala i loved the meat lasagna but really whats not to love its lasagna and it was classically delicious they dont call it moms meat lasagna with meat sauce for nothing crumbled meatballs sausage with ricotta cheese boom i didnt have the rustic chicken shrimp but my friends seemed to like it the chicken marsala was so very good white meat chicken that was so moist and tasty it was the perfect chicken dish i loved it the most and thats saying a lot given that lasagna was on the menu order it trust me for dessert we had offerings chocolate zucotto cake nonnas toasted pound cake all i had was the toasted pound cake thats all i needed it was so damn good crispy edges on the pound cake topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream slivers of chocolate and served along side caramelized bananas game over i dont have to tell you how good it was you already know youre welcome we had an awesome dinner here they seated us right in the window on the strip great view fabulous service the food is really good classic italian the best in the city no but a great place to go especially if you have friends visiting and staying on the strip and want to meet up with them they make it really easy valet right in front of the elevator make a reservation it gets really busy and ask your waitperson for food guidance they know which way to direct you through the big menu we came here to celebrate our daughters birthday this was a big deal for us and we had the entire family in tow had a reservation for at pm called in the afternoon to see if we could move up to which they were able to accommodate got there and the atmosphere is great just a couple minutes and they seated us food was family style and amazing i cant even remember all the courses but there was sublime mozzarella cheese artichoke dip and bread for appetizers sirloin chicken lasagna and alfredo and amazing dessert apple frittata was crazy the waitress was fantastic completely attentive and helpful in her suggestions one down was table was in close to other patrons bumping chairs issue probably because we moved up our reservation one person at the table next to us was total rude jerk i paraphrase for this review toward my daughter which came close to ruining the evening but that wasnt totally restaurants fault managers stepped in and gave us a private room to be sure the rest of our night was perfect this place is top notch dont hesitate to let management know if you have special request theyre very cool and want to make your experience the best it can be as always excellent service with excellent food date night with canvas coppola came here for my husbands birthday dinner made a reservation and was seated promptly upon arrival server was nice but definitely seemed rushed complimentary bread and butter olive oil which was probably the best part of dinner got the crab cakes appetizer which was tasty i ordered the beef tenderloin medallions and husband got chicken marsala my entree was tender and cooked to perfection and tasted good at first if a little monotonous husbands birthday boy entree was a total failure he asked to substitute the standard spaghetti aglio olio with spaghetti meat sauce which didnt happen the chicken was as tough as shoe leather the sauce didnt taste at all of marsala wine and the mushrooms had hardly any evidence of being cooked considering we were here for his birthday it was pretty disappointing still service was nice enough and location and cleanliness cant be faulted i always leave here wishing i could eat more after the flatbread pizza and the fried mozzarella im usually stuffed before they bring out the giant portion of chicken parm ive never had dessert as im already bringing home a ton of food they seated us in the corner with all the windows great view of the strip and plenty of people watching during the meal very efficient waiter i hate to have to give a below star review when the service is extraordinary our waiter kevin i believe im sorry if i get the name wrong but hes tall and talks quite fast was super attentive and helpful however the food wasnt very impressive the lobster carbonara was quite bland and very liquid y my friend said her gnocchi was quite flour y considering the great ambiance the great service and the great reviews this places got i expected more from the food we waited almost an hour for lackluster food that barely rivaled chef boy ardee this place is a shadow of its former self and its origins from chicago theyve managed to accomplish what other big chains avoided mediocrity skip the drama and head to places like the cheesecake factory which while not enlightened delivers quality food with quality service at reasonable prices maggianos las vegas just doesnt make the cut skip it pluses inviting decoratmosphere good food and cocktails which were fairly reasonably priced and the waitstaff was friendly and attentive minuses even though we had reservations it still took mins before we were actually seated and we had to wait in two different fusterclucked lines people were bumping into each other and unsure where to stand or go numerous signs for the host stand were borderline comical giving an alice gone through the looking glass experience but with annoyed tourists we asked the seater to speak to management we were there for family celebration and the evening wasnt feeling terribly special with this first impression who didnt appear until mins later thats because she never bothered to contact himl the manager was extremely defensive admittedly he was probably slightly broadsided by our complaints but still seemed barely receptive to the criticisms and made repeated excuses about the layout of the restaurant and told us we shouldve came in via the revolving doors that we almost got whacked with twice because most of our traffic comes off the strip wed already explained we were locals apparently we shouldnt come in where the valet is all in all wed have been better off going to a nice local joint like chicago joes this place was basically a fancier version of the macaroni grill again and again this place dont stop to make me want to come back here the food is so good and delicious so i will definitely come back here again with friends and family the food and service was great the meat sauce was amazing the only reason i did not give stars is we dined outside on the patio and the ash trays for smokers are rite there in front of the doors and patio so we got to enjoy cigarette and cigar smoke while eating the portions are very generous well worth the price my fiance and i ordered the caesar salad and four cheese ravioli to share the food was savory and appetizing great restaurant for a date food and service were up to par we would definitely recommend as a wonderful place for large and tasty portions with awesome service maggianos in the fashion show mall knows how to consistently produce high quality italian fare over the years ive eaten here many times and have never had a bad plate their holiday season menu adds to the variety and decent wine can be had at decent prices i had the braised ribs off the seasonal menu and they were extremely good likewise the cab off the holiday menu is a decent bottle and they give away a branded carafe for using the menu tip for easy access use valet parking on the north side off fashion show dr then hop into the exterior elevator for a quick ride to the restaurant this place isnt always crowded the food is great and wait times for seating ordering food etc arent bad ive been here three times for lunch during the weekday and weekend and their prices are reasonable for being so accessible from the strip i bring my out of town guests here and my aunt likes to come eat here whenever she visits all the way from oklahoma came here for my birthday a couple of days ago and really enjoyed it the bread came out fast and was so good because it is handmade in the restaurant it was nice not having to starve while waiting for our appetizer and entrees also the customer service was great even though he was waiting more tables he was very attentive and courteous the food came out hot and fast and tasted great we couldnt finish our pasta because we were so stuffed they have large portions and my pasta was only dollars about the same price as olive garden but it was actually delicious believe it or not our total was cheaper than the time we went to olive garden from the time we arrived to the time we left it was only mins so id say service was extremely fast especially since they were busy that night i will go again if im in the mood for italian good location for italian on the strip we came here after a long evening of shopping in the mall i highly recommend getting their lite chicken marsala if you are on a diet service at the bar can be shoddy but the food is great also try out their stuffed mushrooms for appetizers we made a reservation on open table for we arrived and were told that it would be approximately minutes i could tell they were busy so we said no big deal then at pm we were told another minutes it took a total of min after our reservation in which to be seated i wasnt so impressed with their attitude either our service was great once we were sat though seidi our waitress was great she made some recommendations and my husband and i were both completely satisfied i had the chicken piccata and he had the parmesean she recommended the lite on each and the hand made pasta was to die for definitely changed my pasta opinion as this was my first hand made pasta wonderful although i wasnt too impressed with the snotty hostess team the rest of the staff changed my opinion as well as the meal itself i feel bad only giving a stars due to the first impression the food here is terrific but high calorie it is very busy pretty much all the time so make reservations our server was inexperienced forgot to bring my drink but made up for it with a pleasant attitude i would recommend this establishment we were impressed with the ambiance and decor the rooms were full if energy and the food was great our servers satisfied our every request came for new years day can get busy make a reservation dont be afraid to ask if you dont see it on the menu the chef can usually whip it up love the chef k lobster carbonara chicken parm lasgana bruschetta tomato soup and chocolate cake also have requested a broccoli chicken and garlic pasta wonderful big portions about more per meal than your other italian chains but so worth it stephanie was our server local girl who knew the menu and could manage her time and the crowd would love to have her again best italian food ive ever tasted went here on years eve with my wife and daughter and it was super delicious we ha stuffed mushrooms and chicken parm and the cheese ravioli with a side of spaghetti i wish i wouldve took pictures of everything we ate everything was super delicious i recommend this place to everyone who goes to las vegas to stop by this restaurant and when youre leaving i recommend you to grab a handful of the little chocolates they have on a lil basket theyre the bomb came here on sunday night just as a walk in had forgotten the reviews recommended to make reservations place was packed waiting time was minutes for a table of two waited at the bar had the best red sangria ive ever had also ordered the calamari was not rubbery it was lightly crispy so delicious bread they gave was too hard service was excellent finally got a table service was fast friendly the food was delicious too we got the spaghetti meatball and seafood plate a little spicy and so buttery overall the entire experience was excellent come prepared to wait this place is booming another year later and another new years day meal at maggianos this time with friends food was as fine as usual but this time there were just too many service errors to overlook i had to separately ask for more bread three times and butter another three times before they were finally produced a table knife was taken away without substituting a replacement and no serving spoon was provided for potatoes so one star was lost complimentary italian bread had a nice doughy texture calamari fritti with marinara sauce and specially requested lemon aioli featured perfectly cooked golden tentacles and rings and mozzarella marinara consisted of four rectangles of slightly browned fried cheese a side caesar salad with requested anchovies was crunchy and excellent and a bowl of tuscan chicken sausage soup was very good except for hard included celery fontina potatoes were oozing with white cheese and my entree of linguine clams with white clam sauce littleneck clams in open shells and several pieces of chopped clams was quite delicious always make a reservation its super quick and easy on open table i came here for a quick dinner with my man on a sunday it was pretty busy and it took about minutes for someone to come over and greet us after we were sat when ive already completely decided my meal before ive even been offered a drink i get a little impatient thats the only reason i knocked a star off the food came out within minutes or so after we ordered and we split chicken piccata but unfortunately they didnt split it i dont mind paying a split charge especially when i specifically request a split the size was ok only very small chicken breasts but macaroni grill has definitely made us spoiled with portion sizes i would return as it was a nice atmosphere at a good price with decent service and yummy italian food good location right outside the fashion mall and on the strip the hostess was really nice and the environment set the mood for a nice italian dinner do not order the alfredo with chicken the chicken was at room temperature i spend quite some time during the week at fashion show mall for various reasons and maggianos is a tough place to beat every dining occasion ive had here has been more than enjoyable we were seated right away and our server this time around was great i was impressed with how often he checked up on our table and he took the time to hold a conversation with our family i tried their lobster carbonara and their chicken flatbread has always been a favorite if you havent tried this is worth a share around the table food is always prepared as quickly as possible but still maintains its quality and taste will definitely return for many meals to come this is my go to italian restaurant whenever i am near the strip or shopping at the fashion show mall this restaurant can be both casual and fancy at the same time either way they are welcoming but the wait time can be long so i recommend getting a reservation if necessary especially during weekend nights you get complimentary bread in the beginning after you order but dont eat too much of it because the dishes are pretty big i have ordered the famous rigatoni d couple of times and the peppercorn crusted sirloin they were both good the rigatoni can get really heavy because of the marsala cream sauce but dont get me wrong the flavors are all there the mushrooms the chicken go really well with the pasta and the sauce last time i went i got the sirloin cooked as medium but it was pretty chewy so next time i get that i will be sure to get it medium rare i had to cut them into little tiny dices to get through them the garlic mash potatoes that were on the plate added a nice touch to the sirloin i never have room for dessert when i eat here because the proportions are pretty big but it fills me up so im not complaining the waiters are all so kind here but the noise level can get really high especially if there is a large group of people sitting in the middle celebrating a birthday or whatever besides that ive had pretty good experiences with maggianos cant say how much i love maggianos the servers here are always the friendliest people and so helpful with pictures coming here on my vegas trips have become a tradition its walking distance from the wynn and trump tower so its very convenient since driving on the strip is such a hassle the food is not the healthiest but will hold u up during the night i would not recommend getting their salad though because its like the salad out of a dollar bag from the store and very plain we were planning on eating someplace different until our car decided not to work it was fortunate that we were staying at encore and decided to walk across the street to the fashion show mall we tried to eat at grimaldis and we walked all the way over there only to find out that its only pizza now we walked around and found maggianos by the entrance we entered when first got to the mall we looked at the menu and figured it looked good we went to the reception desk and were told it was an hour wait i asked about the bar area and was told it was all open seating as long as everyone in the party was we walked back to the bar and found a high table to sit after minutes we were greeted by the smiley nicole she said she would be our server and took our drink order she brought our drinks back then disappeared for minutes we wondered what happened to her since she seemed like a good server well nicole stopped by and asked if the other server had been by to help us we said no so she apologized profusely and said she would take care of us thank goodness she did nicole is a very good server attentive and responsive there was a miscommunication between her and another server as nicole was going to hand us off to the other server after the mix up was cleared up nicole gave us top notch service the rest of the evening i had the spaghetti with meat sauce and replaced the spaghetti with rigatoni it was a very good dish and i almost finished the whole thing my friend enjoyed her linguine with clams in white wine sauce overall a very good experience at maggianos xie xie i have visited numerous maggianos locations over the years and have loved every visit until this one maggianos has always delivered an excellent consistent product this visit the service was not outstanding we ordered the chicken sausage soup which was served cold i also ordered the lasagna which theyre well known for which was also served cold and the sauce was nearly flavorless i wouldve been more satisfied with a stauffers frozen lasagna i hope the las vegas location management does some serious quality control trains the staff and realizes that vegas is a very competitive market before theyre out of business ill be looking for a new italian location in las vegas ugh we came in for dinner on new years and seated ourselves in the bar area yes its busy i mean holiday in vegas drink like the hubs and i swung by vegas just to see what the type is all about my fave maggiano location is south coast in newport it clean food is favorful great texture and well attentive and high class staff this vegas location we were highly disappointed i ordered the frutti de mare fancy sht right man my entree was salllttttyyyyy my blood pressure and sodium level just increased nurse dilute me my husband got the lasagna and we shared he appetizer of calamari it tasted reheated or microwaved our drinks were the best of the night a coke and a glass of wine prepared directly by the company no chefs needed wears our tab and i shake my head to this restaurant we should stick to our all time fave homey mainstream italian buca di bepo instead went to this location on saturday for my sons birthday which i had already specified on the reservation anyways our server was either mac or max cant really remember the name of a server who really wasnt to attentive and didnt even offer refills on our drinks or acknowledge that we were there for a special occasion when out server brought over the check he asked if we wanted to order dessert and i said well i dont know lets ask the birthday boy hello didnt that ring a bell for our server no he event asked if my son wanted to see the dessert menu i was thinking this is the moment to redeem yourself and bring over a complementary dessert like the one all the other servers where bringing over to the tables celebrating birthdays any who im rating it a because the food was honestly yummy even though our server sucked two thumbs down for him i do recommend this place for good food unfortunately bad service i know the first question you are probably asking is with so many famous restaurants on the strip why are you eating at a chain we had just arrived and wanted something light and close to our hotel we love their salads so we went we found this to be a great maggianos service was some of the best that i have received at a maggianos prices seemed a little higher but it is the strip what do you expect great views of the strip also i have been to maggianos two times they have some tables that are right next to a window that has a really great view of the strip which i liked most people want to sit there so there is a wait time that can be pretty long i ordered the chicken parm and it was really good they also give you a lot of food which a lot of restaurants dont do anymore its a very nice restaurant and will deff be going back hard to imagine great quality awesome service reasonable prices in las vegas at a chain yes maggianos i dont know what else i can say the ambiance was country club menu selection was superb ok it wasnt a quiet little bistro its located on lv blvd in fashion show shopping center but the food is good and you can easily splurge on the wine or drinks and still save a ton over the big name places eg batalis bb etc ok so my husband has been here about times this is my first time here stars for parking stars for it being free for it stinking like crazy down there wth stars for speed of service and seating stars for the beautiful view of the strip from where we sat stars for menu options stars for quality of food stars for price it is on the strip appetizer entrees drinks bucks thank you maggianos because my husband is a fan we will probably be back again a restaurant with excellent food spoiled by poor service owners must send undercover relatives or friends to investigate how their staff is running their business as ongoing quality control our waiter was wonderful knowledgeable and helpful but a bad experience with a front of house staff who sent two of my guests away knowing i was waiting for them and where we were sitting and losing the restaurant money soured my experience and i doubt that i will be back sadly i could have thrown more business their way we went to maggianos for our year anniversary at first they seated us in the middle of the restaurant at av wack table so we asked to b seated at a booth and they moved us with no problem our waiter mark was on point and very cool i highly recommend this place off you want a delicious italian meal at a reasonable price i highly recommend the calimari and salmon oscar bomb stars definitely no need to check for a review this place is great everything they have on menu is great the service is excellent the scenery is excellent the prices are excellent easy access to get to i eat here five times a month located in the fashion show mall on the famous las vegas strip ok so let me start with this and its admittedly a personal bias i dont really like pasta i mean its boiled dough for gosh sakes also i dont like to order chicken at a restaurant unless it comes in a bucket that being said there wasnt a whole lot for me here but i will say that everything is prepared with care and the service was good if you like pasta go for it if not there are plenty of other choices it is las vegas after all live it up you are in las vegas for cryin out loud ugh we came in for dinner on new years day and seated ourselves in the bar area yes its busy i mean its a holiday in vegas right the hubs and i swung by vegas just to see what the type is all about my fave maggiano location is south coast in newport it clean food is favorful great texture and well attentive and high class staff this vegas location we were highly disappointed i ordered the frutti de mare fancy sht right man my entree was salllttttyyyyy my blood pressure and sodium level just increased nurse dilute me my husband got the lasagna and we shared he appetizer of calamari it tasted reheated or microwaved our drinks were the best of the night a coke and a glass of wine prepared directly by the company no chefs needed was our tab and i shake my head to this restaurant and wanted to slap the chef silly we should stick to our all time fave homey mainstream italian restaurant buca di bepo instead we thought the food that maggianos was very very good both my wife and i thought the sauce was excellent and the best weve had in sometime but the service left something to be desired although when we brought the subject to the attention of the manager he corrected the situation promptly overall we give the restaurant a good rating and we do plan on going back again the only good thing about this place is the excellent staff and the ambiance the food is horrible a friend of mine came from out of town so i took her out there i was so disappointed with the food the shrimp scampi was ok their salad indifferent and their veal parmesan was horrible what next time bc there wont be one maggianos is the place i had my best vegas meal here everything was great from the complimentary bread and balsalmicolive oil to my entree a meat lasagna our sangria was really good as well there was also a gentleman walking around the restaurant with a guitar singing to guest awesome experience service was great the food is ok to less than ok we have frequented maggianos for ten years in las vegas and have had our disappointments in the last two years especially that live music is at a minimum these days they have the space for a threesome we dined there on and found the prices had jumped considerably including on happy hour the same old sinatra tony bennett played on and not even for a holiday weekend did they bring in a musician my salmon salad was delivered in a small bowl making it look boring unappetizing why not spread out on a plate my partners country pasta dish of ricotta chicken meatballs sundried tomatoes was not very italian at all he said he wouldnt order it again the service was terrific however so here it is capitalizing on their location adhering to the bottom line called money we went to maggianos for my birthday the food was good although i felt like my steak was drowning in gravy its not something im used to maybe thats just how its prepared my wife referred to her pasta as perfectly cooked its tough to please her so that means something the margarita flatbread was amazing hands down the best food of our entire vegas vacation the service was great our waiter was attentive but not overbearing he came with what we needed asked if we needed anything and was off i like that now i need to say something special about the service the table next to us was very rude to our waiter over how the sauce was presented not prepared just presented he handled it very well as did the manager little tip make a reservation otherwise youll be waiting longer than youd like food was decent nothing too great three of us had the famous rigatoni d i dont know why its famous it didnt taste like much the sauce was very liquid chicken was bland one of my friends had the eggplant it was fine overall three stars service was nice prices are decent for the strip i just held my wedding reception at maggianos and they were fabulous i was planning from a far because im from canada there was more than enough food for everyone and i also opted for a bar package and it was worth every penny the waiters always made sure my guests had a drink the mushroom di ravioli was to die for maggianos also helped me with getting floral centerpieces they were fairly priced and have great longevity also i had some guests with food allergies and the chef came and spoke to those people personally and accommodated for them great value good size portions and excellent staff went for a late night snackmeal at in the evening just soup and salad everything was good service was good seating and for a chain restaurant im always impressed how un chain this restaurant tastes just good food portions seem huge to me too everything was clean even under my table and the window sill we ate inside but the outside seating was heated seeing the evening air was chilly looked nice too food was good service was as well not outstanding or remarkable but what you come to expect from this chain you always know the food and service are good no matter what location my co worker and i arrived here during the week for lunch i parked in the parking structure of the mall which has a elevator that takes you right into the back of the restaurant we requested to be seated on the patio which gave us a great view of las vegas blvd our waiter was prompt in getting our beverages rolls and recommended the lighter four cheese ravioli which i ordered for being a lighter entree it definitely didnt lack flavor was filling and tasted delicious my co worker went for the salmon sammie and also enjoyed the food heart the ambiance here and the old style vegas feel especially with the sinatra music overall a splendid lunch with a great view i definitely will be returning here again my boyfriend and i celebrated our early valentines dinner here this is also where we had our first date i love the atmosphere here as well as the service our waiter nick was amazing he knew the menu like the back of his hand and had great recommendations he constantly checked up on us to make sure we were doing okay food is always on point and i love their drink selection went here with a co worker for lunch a few weeks back had heard really great things about it the appetizer we ordered was the smoked bacon with ricotta cheese on bread highlight of the meal it was fantastic and our waiter had recommended it i ordered ravioli and it was pretty average i think cpk and lavo have better service was excellent and it was pretty busy at the time will maybe come back but the food was mediocre amazing italian food incredible service and a great atmosphere besides who doesnt love to hear frank sinatra in the background we love this place we usually just sit in the bar area and have drinks and appetizers and whatever we order is always full of flavor a hearty serving and tasty a few things i would recommend the maggianos salad with a delicious house dressing and crispy prosciutto the mussles with red sauce that is spicy and sweet and makes you want to pick up the bowl and drink it the flatbreads bruschetta sausage and peppers stuffed shells and chopped salad are also top picks even if you are feeling like you need to unbutton your pants as the server asks you if you would like dessert say yes we ordered the mini sampler and every little delectable sugary bite of creme brulee apple crostada chocolate zuccotto bites tiramisu and cheesecake were perfect we will definitely be back salute perfect couples can enjoy delicious single entrees and families can enjoy family style delicious came here two nights ago to celebrate my besties birthday i love that you can take an elevator from the parking lot directly to the restaurant so gangster the restaurants view is gorgeous and the ambiance has a sexy feel to it the only thing i was not a fan of was the red and white checkered table cloths such a beautiful dining room overlooking the strip soothing jazz music playing in the background with those table cloths our server was very friendly down to earth and attentive our orders came out surprisingly fast as an appetizer we had the stuffed mushrooms we loved it i ordered the eggplant parmesan which was very tasty as well italian food when cooked properly is very comforting also another thing that i really enjoyed and just shows how well the kitchen is run was that the bread for the table came out very warm i hate going to a restaurant and they serve you cold bread overall it was a great experience lovely restaurant nice atmosphere genuine service good italian food and convenient parking one of my favorite restaurants in vegas the food is great the ambiance is fantastic the view is superb the service is state of the art if you love italian and want a place that has a classy but busy happening feel try magganios we came here with a group of colleagues and clients the staff managed our fluid numbers well we had some come and some go and were not flustered at all we had so much food we couldnt do it all i think it was one of the set menus here basically the food just keeps coming we had beef medallions lasagne salads pasta the works all very tasty well prepared and served promptly and hot cant fault it have been here several times in vegas and highly recommend it for a casual meal all i can say is holy moly ravioli amazing italian food great vibes great service beautiful view and did i say the food was on point the four cheese ravioli and the chicken fettuccine alfredo were the best i have ever had as a local i know their are a lot of italian restaurants in las vegas but nothing beats maggianos always on the top of my list been to maggianos in new jersey better experience there from the hostess who ignored us and spent time talking to servers while she saw us waiting to the waiter who put in the wrong salad order to the server who brought us our main course before we were finished with the salad the employees were not the best the food was very good so that is the only thing that kept me from giving stars maybe it was a bad night for the workers main courses cooled down while we were finishing our salads in a hurry couldnt linger over salads since our food was already on the table food was nothing special perfect place for a romantic dinner food is great and the portion size is also awesome did wait about min for a seat but obviously what do you expect its an amazing restaurant amazing food as well as amazing hosts the lady who helps us was named mariana i think and she was so nice and helpful coming here again no doubt great atmosphere for appetizer we had the zucchini fritte which was my husbands favorite we also ordered a side of caesar salad which needed more dressing so we asked for more we also ordered the tomato basil soup not the best soup ive had its too watery and not enough of the tomato taste more basil for our entree we got the chicken marsala the lighter version and my husband said the chicken was dried i had the alfredo fettuccine with chicken my alfredo sauce was alright not my favorite i think olive garden has better alfredo fettuccine overall not bad for lunch but for italian food it was decent price and the waitress was really nice this place is just excellent and their food is delicious and the apple crostada is out of this world favorite dish is the rustic chicken n shrimp went in last night after some friends getting married i am giving it stars because the atmosphere is great and our server was wonderful i have been here a few times and the food was always good last night it was lacking something the presentation was boring it was as if it was just thrown on the plate little messy apps were good chopped salad was delish i would say that was my fav of all the dishes we had seems as if quality has gone downhill classy rat pack music meticulously clean upscale men wear a suittie or dress it down nicely casual but certainly no flip flips and gym shorts here the dark wood interior walls have some nice old las vegas framed black n white photos tables are white cloth nicely dressed wait staff bathrooms even have cloth towels just a very classy italian restaurant having lunch on the outdoor patio overlooking the strip was wonderful on this beautiful spring afternoon full bar w dining option happy hour specials reservations recommended for seating by floor to ceiling windows or prepare to go shopping and come back and wait some more etc heres my favorite hands down rig d rigatoni d herb roasted chicken mushrooms caramelized onions marsala cream sauce along w my rig d i ordered a side salad w house dressing fresh loaf of bread w some oilvinegar and a pat or of butter washed it down w some iced tea w lemon wedge and then relaxed with a full stomach enjoying a nice glass of pinot grigio santa margherita to complete one of my all time favorite meals this can be a very romantic place or bring your co workers to celebrate a special occasion but do leave the kids at home buon appetito best italian food in vegas wouldnt go to vegas without eatting there veal parmesian to die for one problemdo you know people can lean their big butts against the front window where u r eatting and smoke their cigarettes right there super gross mgr had to move us to a different table hes not allowed to post a non smoking sign outside or ask persons to not loiter unheard of will definately ask for a window without the cigarette and butt views next time disgusting id like to say the ambience was great but that really ruins it i love this place the portions are huge id rather have a smaller portion with a salad included the bread and olive oil is ok at best the view of the strip makes it nice hands down my favorite place in the world great location with amazing scenery i always get the famous d i will continue to do so i have certain food allergies that keep me from eating things made in this dish but theyre more than happy to make me a new batch without said ingredients would recommend to a friend thanks for existing should expand throughout vegas friendly service and a great view of the encore wynn and palazzo will definitely return was super slow tonight good good service ok got my order wrong at first then my take out veggie only salad was tiny at plus tip sad fantastic franchise that makes you feel like you are part of the familia maggianos has an excellent template of a menu replicated at each location this particular location is given special attention because its in vegas the view is brilliant from the corner window tables very romantic some days there is a violinist strolling around playing requests try the calamari and maggianos salad to begin with stuffed mushrooms arent bad either traditional fare is great lasagna and angel hair pasta with arrabiata sauce finish with tiramisu and a moscato delicious everything was good and very well presented service was top notch all food tasted like i was in italy and the creme brulee was also good but when isnt it i recommend this place for sure havent been to a maggianos in such a long time i happened to be doing a little shopping over the weekend so a friend and i decided to grab a quick bite the greeters were super friendly and funny i always appreciate a little humor people in the service industry on the strip can get so jaded dealing with tourists reservations were not needed during off peak hours we came here around like pm and we were seated immediately we ordered the fried zucchini ravioli and maggianos salad holy mother of the fried zucchini is amazing i dont know where they are buying their zucchini but the pieces were gigantic and barely fit on the serving platter lets try not to think about gmos for the moment and my goodness the tangy creaming sauce they bring with it so good i couldve eaten only this maggianos salad was a spectacular burst of flavor i normally hate blue cheese but it was nicely tossed throughout the salad with crispy pieces of prosciutto the prosciutto was a little overcooked but that was really my only complaint our waiter was prompt but unfriendly i dont think i saw a smile the entire time in fact he seemed a little annoyed we were lavishing in our girly time he could stand to take a couple notes from the greeting staff at the door they were so nice thank you maggianos for making my moms birthday dinner special the manager jesse was friendly helpful and came to our table personally to make sure we were okay our waiter nick was professional and knowledgeable about the menu and what to suggest an absolute delight we got the calamari fritti chicken parmesan veal marsala chopped salad with chicken and the nonnas pound cake for dessert dinner was delicious and the service was superb we read comments from yelp before going to dinner i had lasagna which was good my husband had chicken parmasean with side of spaghetti his spaghetti was cold and asked for it to be rewarmed we asked more times and he informed us that he was waiting on the kitchen after min they showed up with spaghetti not impressed at all we really like this chain good quality food fair pricing large portions nice decor and excellent service the family style is great for large parties everyone gets to share we ate here tonight for our anniversary our server christine was excellent we had the chicken parmesana and the tomato basil soup with a bottle of hands merlot everything was delicious only suggestions please notice water glasses and bread need refilling also a few more options for vegetarians would be appreciated there are usually more items to choose from when eating italian food we always know we will have an enjoyable meal at maggianos been to this restaurant twice and it was better the first time this visit food was good but not extraordinary i had lobster carbonera it was good but not a true carbonara atmosphere is nice and prices are very reasonable a nice break from getting rammed on the strip wine was pricey though i would go back another time and give another chance food was delicious i ordered chicken fettuccine alfredo lighter choice it was delicious we also order the mini deserts for i believe pretty and very good best tiramisu ive had favorite spot in vegas my initial thought was that this feels like a chain restaurant without realizing it was the young low quality waitstaff the generic menu and the robotic operationally efficient way the place was run all made me think that the couple in front of us requested and was granted a booth we then ask for a booth and are told there are no booths available we look around and there are tons of booths available both on the outskirts of the floor layout and right in the middle we ask if those were reserved and the host says no there is only one table open and no booths open and he says that is due to lack of waitstaff wtf within minutes of us sitting at a table the next couple is sat at a booth wtf this pisses off my buddy who says something negative and storms off to talk to the manager a random waitress hears this and ask if there is a problem i tell her the issue and her reply is essentially we have lots of booths available for you to sit long story short the manager moves us to the booth we figured they would seat us at in the first place our waiter at the first table was terrible id expect him at an applebees in some podunk town of people not a supposed nice restaurant on the strip his unkept hair and facial hair that more closely resembled pubic hair made him look like he was homeless he talked like a surfer duuuude this isnt taco bell buddy he also didnt seem to know what he was doing he would just ask if we know what we want and then would disappear for a long time he brought my water without the lemons i requested when he asked if we needed anything else i said lemons and hes like sure dudeseemingly oblivious to the fact that he had previously told us he would bring some our waiter at our nd table was much more experienced he gave us spiels about the menu items he was also far more attentive one funny thing i heard him say quite loudly to the other waiter that most would have taken offense to was that the first waiter won the lottery which was an obvious reference to us not spending much money it should be noted that we ordered drinksdesert later which he didnt realize when he made the comment to me the menu was boring and bland it should be noted i dont eat seafood there was nothing that jumped out at me and told me it wanted me to eat it so i just made the oh so generic order of spaghetti and meatballs with meat sauce it was tasty dont expect anything special from it free bread before the meal always gets my approval and it was good i also ordered the tiramisu which was awesome definitely recommend that my buddy was told each waiter only has tables which i cant fathom especially with as poor service as the original waiter delivered i assumed they were having service issues because youtube personality the trooper recently quit working there the host was clueless and didnt even know who the trooper was whattttuuuup trooper its the yelp reviewer letting you know that maggianos has already gone downhill since you left this place is awesome really nice tasty different beers had that marco deal and it was really nice luv that place ohh and also nice view if u chose to set outside family style italian resturant in a nice more up scale yet casual setting this is a chain resturant but this location is located in fashion show mall with drive up valet parking available on the side of the building to provide easy access the drinks are good and the food is awesome there are all sorts of italian favorites and they are done right a perfect place to take family out on the town for a nice dinner with a view of the stripe or a dinner date prices are fair and great portions of food i will definatley come back oh no maggianos what is happening to you this used to be a great place to eat with delicious food wine good atmosphere and service sadly about a year ago when i was in lv and i ate there with my partner the food was just ok and we felt it was overpriced for the quality i felt the same when i was there again last october still i have eaten there almost every trip i take to lv so i went again a few days ago this time yikes i ordered the eggplant parmesan and i could barely eat it i wonder if it was stored in the kitchen for a while or what because i could only eat a few bites it was sitting on top of spaghetti which was weird and tasted just ok before my main meal i had tomato bisque soup which was very salty i was so disappointed in the meal my waiter was rather scattered i had to ask him four times for some butter for my bread i will say he was friendly and did his best i think he could tell i did not like the food as he did give me some lemon cookies from their bakery when i asked for my check i will say those were delicious but i wasnt there for cookies i dont think i will come back to eat at maggianos unless the locals tell me that the restaurant has improved and is back on track im sad to give this review as i really used to love maggianos and that is why it gets two stars instead of one iliana was our lovely server for a party of and she was fantastic food was great drinks were perfect overall great night great experience had a party of nine to celebrate a wedding the staff was very attentive and helpful the food was great i give this place four stars because maggianos food quality is losing its touch they used to be amazing overall i do like the location theres a great view and its in a fun shopping mall the price of the food is expensive so i do expect good service and food quality each time i go if you can tell the difference between good italian and great italian then this place might be a hit or miss depending on the chef if not then you will think this place is outstanding the service was terrible it was way over priced for the amount of food you got the food tasted fine but for what you pay you think you would get more too pricey my experience at maggianos was greeted promptly and with courtesy food server was outstanding management presence was minimal food quality was marginal view of the strip was enjoyable interior was clean and comfortable design and motif was excellent would likely return but could probably find better quality italian food elsewhere the food was excellent i ordered the lunch lasagna my wife ordered the lunch chicken parmesan when we received our food we were amazed at the lunch portions and the extra side order of spaghetti the food was amazing the atmosphere in side is nice but the view from outside is lovely this place is absolutely phenomenal the food is amazing great quality great location positive environment staff is every helpful which makes the experience great fast friendly i would recommend this place to anyone great for locals visitors suits all occasions whether its a romantic date or a night out with the whole family brandon was our server which is awesome christy the manager was very polite love this place went here this evening for my nd visit although the first visit was a very positive one a reality check was in line this evening food server was not welcoming rude in fact food server was very difficult to understand food server was robotic and seemed to be completely in genuine almost cold asked management to change our server management came to the table and asked why um yes the supervisor mod actually did this food quality was fair new server was pleasant but a little overly friendly and robotic likelihood of returning has diminished to we avoid the strip area if possible its usually crowded and lots of traffic but when we do make a trip this way our dinner spot is maggianos each time we are here the service is always great no matter who it is managers are looking around making sure things are in order someone is alway coming around to refill drinks clear empty dishes and our server tonight val is great she made sure everything went smoothly kids ordera were put in so they dont have to wait so long and brought out their desserts just at the right time their portions are big i always leave with half my dish to go and when i reheat it the next day its still delicious i found them using the tripadvisor application on my phone and the cool part was that i made a reservation thru the application i made the reservation for pm on a friday and i drove minutes i literally walked in and sat down bypassed a line and they were packed i love this application where to park there is complimentary valet parking at forever on fashion show drive there is an elevator that takes you to the back of the restaurant located above the las vegas strip it has a great view and ambiance i ordered a bowl of creamy tomato basil soup which was devine the bread complimented the meal but i was disappointed i wasnt offered italian dipping sauce italian butter by a different name i love olive oil vinegar and spices to dip my bread in i had a large grilled chicken caprese salad as my entree and asked to substitute spinach for the mixed greens off the menu fresh mozzarella tomatoes cucumbers kalamata olives red onions garlic croutons white balsamic vinaigrette i like that the cucumbers and chicken were diced up perfect mouthfuls i could barely taste the mozzarella cheese even though they were large bites i would recommend a stronger cheese that can overcome the dressing and stand out on its own the olives were pitted and i really appreciate that i topped off the meal with a hot cappuccino my waiter rafael e was very attentive pleasant and visited me often my water glass was never empty and there were no broken dishes we had a small wedding dinner here for my daughter and her husband last weekend the food was excellent as well as the service the portions were great and everyone really enjoyed themselves thanks maggianos for a great time check out the image that i posted for this restaurant their food is amazing the staff is super friendly and the service was really fast too if you like italian do not miss out on this restaurant and a personal turn on for me is when restaurants have good olive oil on the table for you and maggianos sure does have amazing olive oil p the location of this restaurant is kinda cool too because its right above the mall so you can go shopping after eating if you need anything stars with no doubt the las vegas restaurant scene can be overwhelming and expensive my family was in the mood for pasta so after much research we decided to give maggianos a try we all had pasta and were very happy with our meals i had the shrimp scampi which was excellent one thing we liked was the lighter side options on some of the pasta dishes which was perfect for my wife and daughter the service was excellent and the prices are reasonable give it a try for a chain establishment the customer service at this location was excellent we sat at the bar because the dining room was full we had full service and the bartender michael was superb not to mention his recommendation for the lobster carbonara was fantastic have always gotten pasta when at maggianos and it has always been the best ever so this time we decided to get peppercorn sirloin omg it was the best since it comes with peppercorn sauce not knowing if we would like it we asked for it on the side which was a good idea since we did not like the sauce i love this place my go to place for pasta in vegas for now on i drove to vegas right after work from cali on an empty stomach with a craving for some pasta done right i had maggianos book marked so it was the obvious choice pulled into fashion show mall garage and i just happened to park right by an elevator that led directly to maggianos already winning out the elevator we walked into what looked to be the alternative entrance with a sign that said go to the main host booth up front it was a little awkward at first walking all the way through the restaurant to get to the front but it gave us a chance to admire the place loved the atmosphere and decor fresh bread was good but pretty basic slight disappointment there as i was kinda expecting something that would blow olive gardens breadsticks out the water but they did have some legit olive oil on the table we ordered the chefs special lobster carbonara and chicken fettuccine the lobster carbonara just might be the best pasta ive had perfectly made creamy cheesy carbonara sauce infused with the flavors both the smoked bacon and the lobster was crazy good my wifes fettuccine was a huge disappointment in comparison it had an off taste that she nor i did not like fortunately we were able to take it back i sadly gave my wife my dish and i ordered lasagna which was super good too easily one of the best lasagna dishes i had i was also told they are willing to do custom pasta dishes where you can pick your noddles sauces and items in the pasta check your statements we recently went for my sister in laws birthday dinner and to our surprise a couple of days later there was an extra added on when we clearly left the tip in cash we are locals we know to leave tips on cash to help them out service was awful and the tip wasnt necessary but we did anyway called the manager and he stated we are human we all make mistakes so how many others have had this happen we got a great view great food and pleasant service what more could i have asked for a bit overpriced in my opinion but good standard italian comfort food ordered a french cab to sip on a simple spaghetti with marinara sauce and a side of cooked spinach what more could a girl need i came here in the daytime for lunch on the strip so it wasnt too crowded at all service was prompt and food did not take ages to come out good job i recently dined at this maggianos and it was wonderful i have never had such a great experience dining by myself at the bar with the bartender stephanie the food was fresh the calamari was tender the salad was crunchy and crispy and the flavors were delectable i spoke with one manager briefly i believe his name was jesse he made sure i was well taken care of and was enjoying myself another young lady who is a manager and very beautiful also make sure i was well taken care of i want to say her name was christmas she had dark reddish brown hair with bangs and she was tall and stunning but very professional if only i could of have the courage to ask her for her phone number stephanie is a great bartender and made a wicked delicious sangria its always good when you cant taste the alcohol in your drink that means its really good i will definitely be back and hopefully ill run into christmas and stephanie those ladies are awesome and easy on the eyes to great food friendly staff big portions nice atmosphere i will return and bring more friends and family try try try the tuscan mussels never would i have thought id like sea slugs but i could not get enough of these id give this place stars but for the price the service was lacking our server didnt get all of our order right and our drinks took forever my husband and i had our wedding reception here in march and we were thrilled with how everything went the location the room the food the setup made our special day so memorable everyone on the eventcatering staff was a pleasure to work with and made the whole planning process a breeze the room size and table setup was perfect and we shipped some items ahead for place setting decor and they did an amazing job setting everything just like we envisioned the waitstaff was superb and the food was to die for i want to go back and repeat all of our guests raved about the dinner served family style just like in the restaurant if youre looking for a venue for a special occasiongathering in las vegas i cant recommend maggianos highly enough disappointed crab cakes were not good filled with fish and too much breaking no lump crab meat back fin ok but with not worth it chicken piccata had too many capers sloppy presentation and no sauce worst part is that i made reservations weeks ago for fathers day and requested a table by the window they only had a booth right next to the bathroom entrance which did not start the evening off well use to be one of my favorite places on the strip to dine but not anymore ate here sunday for lunch with a friend for the first time we had a looong nightearly morning wanted some good food after our check out i ordered the mushroom ravioli which would have been great had it not been so damn salty i literally was only able to eat pieces of ravioli i dont remember what my friend ordered but it looked so good service was great no complaints the location is great quality of the dish stars points service interior organizations hygiene the price was not overpriced for the portions my year old didnt care much for alfredo ziti and shes not a picky eater at all i tried linguini and clam with white sauce it was little too salty but it was decent nonetheless with tons of clam my mom had the shrimp scampi and thought it was decent service was excellent the flatbread was delicious and the pasta alfredo with chicken and shirmp mmmm the price was right this place is so delicious my sister and her husband had taken me here while i was in las vegas for the weekend let me tell you i want this place where i live yes its pricey but its so worth it the plates are big and will fill you up the staff is lovely and had no problem what so ever with that i recommend this place if you want to have a very nice dinner this will definitely be a place that i will make a priority to eat at while im down here again they mailed my mom a birthday coupon so we went as a family baby and all the wait was long and it was hot but we opted to sit in the outdoor seating area to avoid waiting underneath the escalator without misting system as it was out the view across the strip looking at wynns lush landscaping was kinda nice the ads playing on loop on the wynn billboard also kept me entertained there were a couple of memorable ambulance runs down the strip as i felt compelled to to pressed my hands to the babys ears to protect her eardrums not much to say about the food its maggianos i remember liking the one in houston better but i think it depends on what you get and i was not particularly impressed with the dishes we got that night i think next time they mail in a coupon ill pass one of my favorite restaurants in las vegas their balcony is the best place to eat and its always nice going to a restaurant connected to fashion show mall since its close by after shopping my favorite thing on their menu is their seafood linguine their chocolate cake and latte is really good as well i came to maggianos celebrate another yelper terri r birthday with family and friends it was my first visit so never had much came to expectations truthfully left with nothing exciting or inspiring comes to review if there was one thing that stood out more then the food was the service was awesome our waitresses really wish remember her name cause she deserve shout out in otherwise a ok review she was super friendly cracking jokes with everyone keeping the atmosphere positivefestive on top of our every needs and personnel touches stood out for me she had whole separate dessert just for birthday girl just happen she was not at the table so took the dessert back and waited for birthday girl come back light the table right in front of her great service since it was decent size party we had nine terri was able to order family style meal it reminded me bucca di beppo style starters we had fried calamari spinach and artichoke dip and caesar salad entrees not sure the filling believe ricotta raviolis with tomato sauce spaghetti with tomato sauce chicken marsala think and lasagna dessert chocolate cake and one more forgot by the time got to the dessert was stuffed none of the dishes had wow factor at all some of them felt like lack any depth of flavor the tomato sauce in the spaghetti and am sure same base sauce use on the lasagna bland not even sure if they put salt or pepper in it the portion size got nothing to say except nice and generous the pricing not all that bad for strip restaurant the atmosphere is upscale but looking at the prices reasonable it located in the fashion show mall so parking is ample and whether you valet or not easy access overall so many more italian restaurant in vegas that are just as reasonable that food taste so much better on this night it celebration beastmode terri r not about the food but supporting family happy birthday terri r best meal in vegas beverly our server was outstanding and the food was delicious maggianos is a the lasagne was to die for go during happy hour for dome great prices on coppola wine too again this place will get five stars from me im just going to keep this one simple great food great service and a spectacular view overlooking the las vegas strip we had dinner here a few weeks ago and despite the hustle and bustle inside the atmosphere was great they even have a singing maitre d overall we had an amazing time and went home with full and happy bellys dined here on stars because the food was so delicious the service however was substandard the waiter wasnt very friendly rushed us into ordering forgot to bring our drinks as well not sure if will dine here again as this wasnt the first maggiano location who didnt provide good service which is unfortunate the bread is always warm and fresh the balsamic on the table is just enough balsamic to make your taste buds giggle when dipped in a mixture of olive oil with the bread then transform into delicious savory hug as it cascades down your throat all the italian food from the salad my favorite to the pasta tastes authentic and flavorful the atmosphere is inviting homey yet elegant and everyone who ive have the pleasure of being served by has been polite and personable its awesome go been here twice and the food is always tasty my mushroom ravioli was delicious and my mom had their chicken fettuccine alfredo and it was mediocre one thing i did love was this fruity soda they had very fresh and tasty our server was okay she looked like she was in a rush the whole time either than that everything was fine we had a really good table next to the windows so i loved that i absolutely loved this restaurant we arrived with a group of including two small children and they were able to accommodate room for our strollers the wait was not long l considering that it was noon and the lunch rush had just started their kids menu was reasonable and delicious good atmosphere and good food all around but the stuffed mushrooms are my favorite out of any restaurant i will go just so i can order them as an appetizer we had a great experience for our reception dinner we only had a small group people but i think even if we would have had more people the experience would have been the same i was able to book everything online via email through beth beth was fabulous every step of the way she answered my emails very quickly always responded to my just one more thing and took a few moments to show me around when i arrived in town before our event when we arrived everything was set up and ready to go we were able to step outside for less than minutes review our bill and pay it so we could just enjoy our evening the flow of the evening went smoothly the food was incredible my guests are still talking about it and joe kept our glasses filled my only complaint was that i didnt get to try the chicken dish that i heard was so delicious but that was my own fault and joes for being so efficient in filling my wine glass when we were ready to leave our leftovers were boxed up and ready to go which was great for our guests and ultimately us too as our flight was cancelled and it made for a great breakfast even though there was no chicken left over if you need a place to host an event this is the place to go everything was wonderful from start to finish thanks again insist want to thank to all the staff they made my wedding reception incredibly beautiful it was only for hours but we all enjoyed the food the service and desserts everything was delicious me and my husband are very happy we made a great decision of making our wedding reception here best italian restaurant ive been to in vegas in the strip lobster carbonara was uniquely the best italian ive had as far lobster carbonara and hand twisted noodles all from a scratch kitchen this place is excellent happy hour is from pm great atmosphere and employees great strip views with perfectly prepared italian food i highly recommend the lobster carbonara and stuffed mushrooms very reasonably priced for the setting vibe and quality of food i like the lobster carbonara here rich decadent and filling as expected excellence in front and service by stephanie very similar service as in costa mesa mama ask for the today and tomorrow treat but we did not it was already included with our marcos menu special for for two appetizer lasagna tiramisu and two pasta meals for tomorrow what a great deal gracie marco arrivederci stefania best italian meal ever we ordered the famous rigatoni d lobster carbonara bruschetta salad and creamy tomato basil soup even the salad dressings were yummy great service and pretty view of the wynn and the encore hotels looking forward to trying them at home in socal we had to come to vegas to try them out i love maggianos the sausage and peppers are really good the peppers are so good plus the peppers are so colorful and sweet the food is really good plus the device is good and the waiters are nice i have sat inside and outside and i actually prefer sitting outside i booked the reservations for party of at pm on saturday we were families and one of the family was running late one family party of adults kid yrs and yrs old arrived at pm they went to the host and asked for the reservation which was under his name me the hostess was reluctant to have them seated after requesting times stating that they will make everyone seated once all the parties will arrive what kind of customer service is this finally getting impatient as yrs old was cranky i had raise my voice and asked for the manager then finally at pm they got us seated my friends family arrived mins later this in appropriate for a business like maggianos the host should have been trained on the behavior on how to interact with the customer i wouldnt recommend maggianos las vegas due to its poor customer service in dealing with people specially families with kids thereafter the service was phenomenal waitress were nice food was great too but initial experience was pathetic delicious lasagna my husband and i ordered two chopped salads and one lasagna and it was plenty of food salads bread and lasagna were delicious this place was great great food cocktails ambience and view of all the city lights at night its located on the nd floor of the fashion mall across from trump towers i had one of their specials that was basically a chicken dish of chicken kabob type pieces with chicken meatballs and chopped peppers onions and quartered potatoes the hubs had chicken parmesan that came with a side of spaghetti everything is a la carte so we also ordered dinner salads great mojitos vodka martinis the buttered cake with marscapone cream and scoop of ice cream was ah mazing we rolled out of their we were so full the place was hopping even at pm it was such an amazing meal for me and my friends they only reason i give it stars is because we where seated in such a small table our plates didnt really fit otherwise food was amazing always been a fan of maggianos but this location is my favorite so far we had a very nice strip view the service was great and the food was delicious as always the fried zucchini appetizer is a must try atmosphere and staff are great price for the quality and quantity of food is good we had a group of and did the family dinner plan a great deal especially if everyone is starving the food and drinks keep coming without asking until you beg them to stop taking into account we were eating dinner at pm and they were closing i will say that they did a great job and didnt rush us we will return again at a regular dinner hour and see if the food is any better crab cakes were out of this world perfectly cooked and presented with a small salad just the perfect amount of food for a lunch or early dinner the lemon drop cocktails were equally delicious service a when i visited vegas february th this was one of the places i wanted to dine at again i had the chicken frances it was cooked to perfection the noodles were fresh and the chicken was buttery my companion had the shrimp diavolo it was perfectly spicy and the shrimp was plentiful and plump the salad was flavorful excellent the atmosphere was a perfect mix of casual not so much formal the wait staff was impressive and our table had a lovely view of the las vegas strip i would highly recommend and i will visit there again when i come back to vegas love their hot bread and vinegar to start with lobster carbonara was the best stuffed mushrooms were to die for im actually sitting in the restaurant right now and i have to write this review asap bc just ugh im basing my review on the food our waiter was very good but the food was not up to par first off the bread they serve is par baked so its not fully crunchy or done bleh i ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and i had super high expectations bc its an italian place and theyre known for cheese they dip was thinned cream and spinach and artichoke i dont know if the chef just ran out of ingredients but i am so not paying for something so crappy view picture for my struggle the crostini was fine it could be sliced thin get but the dip was just horrible they didnt make a thick enough rox or didnt add enough cheese to make the dip thick and they didnt put enough spinach and artichoke how could the expediter allow this to happen smh im better off buying a frozen pack from trader joes we were really surprise by how busy this restaurant at the mall was we arrived hungry and ready to eat at pm thinking that we would get seated right away but it was packed minute wait which is not too bad the food was delicious the linguine frutti de mares was excellent extra large portion with extra mussels clams lobster and a kick of spices which is appetizing for a hot summer night i wanted a lighter fare so i ordered the caprese mozzarella and the cheese was so good i did order grilled scallops for my main course but i think it was sitting under the lights for too long and the scallops were overcooked to the point of being stringy and hard the manager took the order away and offered to replace the scallops for another dish on the house at that point we were full from the pasta dish so we declined i think it was just an oversight on such a busy night beside this incident we really enjoyed our meal at maggiano service was excellent food was delicious ambiance was authentic and on point if youre craving for some real authentic italian food this place is a great option came here for my husbands birthday first time here our server was real nice and explained well the menu the food was great and my husband loved the bread he kept asking for more there was also this gentleman providing entertainment and he sang happy birthday to my husband it was a lovely evening amazing i took my boyfriend here for his th birthday and omg we were blown away the food was amazing we had the bruschetta rigatoni d and chicken parmesan after we ate a wonderful man came and sang happy birthday to my boyfriend with his guitar then the restaurant manager came over and asked how our night was going then insisted that we have dessert in honor of his birthday i didnt the name of the three desserts we were given complimentary btw but it was amazing will defiantly be returning one of the best experiences ive had in vegas in a long time my husband and i were born and raised in vegas we are always looking for new delicious places to eat when we were kids we would hang out at the fashion show mall a lot but maggianos was a little bit out of our price range you definitely get what you pay for large portions great service and amazing desserts we had the most delicious creme brulee ive ever had the tiramisu was also delish the only complaint i had was the bread it is very traditional oil and balsamic dipping bread but my husband always prefers garlic bread just preference i love bread either way i would highly recommend this place first time trying out this italian restaurant they had awesome service and started off with warm bread and olive oil and balsamic they werent stingy with how many pieces of bread they gave us i had the seafood pasta and asked for no mussels or clams and they stuffed it with more shrimp and lobster they arent stingy with their portions i would give stars if i could even better raphael was one best waiters ive had in years he almost told me ingredients he was so precise top notch food thank you guys for the experience on my annerversary food was amazing of course ive always had great experiences here food is always great and very reasonably priced the two of us had dinner with a glass of wine each and the tab came out to about not bad i had the chicken marsala and absolutely loved it the mushrooms were amazing paired it with a zinfandel from cline winery and it supplemented extremely well she had the lasagna and seemed to enjoy it as well and the bread is amazing i look forward to many more dinners here vanessa was an amazing server she picked up the slack from our original server who was very busy with a large party of people so it was completely understandable she made me and my friend feel very comfortable had great suggestions and was fantastic i had their beef tenderloin and it was deeeelicious also great great tiramisu we were looking for a good but not exorbitantly priced italian dinner on the strip after the cirque du soleil show at treasure island and maggianos open until did not disappoint the food was excellent the quantities generous the atmosphere upscale but not formal and the service both courteous and efficient the three of us were uniformly pleased with our respective selections chicken spinach and ricotta stuffed manicotti for me eggplant parmesan with gluten free pasta for norm and i believe traditional home style lasagna for dennis a favorite of the philly native our meals were preceded by warm soft and delicious house baked bread accompanied with olive oil which we determined not to over indulge in in anticipation of the main dishes of reportedly large portions which again did not disappoint in either quality or quantity my manicotti rested in on a pool of delicious and thankfully not nauseatingly rich asiago cream sauce a lactaid event of potential dairy disaster especially as it was determined early on there would be no leftovers but all settled just fine and i dont regret one rich delicious bite or spooning up the remaining asiago sauce after the entree was gone my meal came in at a very reasonable especially for the strip plus spinach side salad with pine nuts a not overpowering smattering of red onion applewood smoked bacon a white balsamic vinaigrette and blue cheese i loathe bleu cheese but had mistaken it on sight for feta and the salad did not suffer for its removal regrettably there was no room for dessert service was polite efficient and more than reasonably attentive my iced tea and water glasses never stayed low for long our total for including wine beer and my tea and side salad came in at i believe under which we agreed was very reasonable given the location quality quantity service atmosphere and ambiance we were surprised to learn this restaurant is part of a modest sized chain of maggianos little italy restaurants and grateful to find out they have one comparatively near us in phoenix over in scottsdale given distances and our budgets maggianos wont be a regular dining destination for us but it will be a special one if all locations are as good as this one we collectively highly recommend this a nice spot in the shopping centre away from the casino cacophony it is a bit of an adventure getting there due to construction along the strip and around the mall despite this minor inconvenience we were welcomed by the bartender and directed to a top table waters and cocktails were ordered to battle the slight hangover from previous eves shenanigans the menu is varied but not overdone offering traditional italian meals the of us places our orders i went for the chicken parm sandwich all our food arrived at once hot and fresh my sandwich was good nicely seasoned my dining companions commented similarly regarding their meals maggianos opens on to the mall for post meal shopping and to walk off a good meal hostess was completely rude about my lace dress i understand policies but there is much nicer ways to saying my lace dress want appropriate no apologies were offered and she completely tried to embarrass me im sure someone couldve handled my situation way better than she did i love coming here but until this hostess is gone i will not be coming back ever delicious italian food in the fashion show mall on the strip nice setting and great service a word of warning the portion sizes are drastically different between entrees check with your server what size the entree you want is i ended up with a massive portion and my husbands dish was tiny linguini di mare is delicious huge and full of seafood shrimp fra diavolo is good but small the service was more than expected everyone was fantastic the food was great very filling the location was beautiful the restaurant was very nice our server paolo was so helpful and friendly we even had a guitarist serenade us it was the best experience i will make it a point to go every time im in town had a great dinner there while celebrating husbands birthday in fact we were so pleased we returned there again a day later the service was superb truly the best service we encountered anywhere in a long while loved the setting the atmosphere and the food i do have one complaint during the dinner there was a young lady walking around with the camera offering to take couples photo at first my husband declined as he felt he was underdressed but she insisted that the photo was complimentary and lingered around until we agreed she returned toward the end of our dinner with a complimentary postcard as well as two large photos she wanted us to purchase for when we declined she went down in price and seemed offended we did not want to buy them when we did not want any pictures to begin with this really should not be taking place during dinner as it is in bad taste and cheapens the whole experience i go here every single time i visited las vegas for my tiramisu craving even though ive lost my craving for sweets these days i still come here for that heaping slice i usually go get it at their to go counter in the back and they have seats sure the wait time is a little long and sometimes i have to ask around for a to go person and im not gonna lie the first time i got lost but overall i know where to go now seeing how im moving back to las vegas im going to try to abstain going here as much just so i dont get fat the slice itself in to go always seems to make me happy that i get it they put the slice on chocolate sauce and it seems to be garnished so nicely though i think im only going to order at the to go counter seeing that the last time i order it at the bar they kind of just got the slice and didnt really do much with it still tasted great but i actually do enjoy how they garnish it putting all of that aside the restaurant and its food is just as splendid altogether ive eaten there with a friend and they give a great size in portions dont remember what i ordered but then again its pasta i felt full and happy afterwards i like it here i hope it stays for a very long time despite renovations at the mall thanks guys we loved everything we got amazing drunken noodles cashew chicken and the tom ka gai artsy beautiful restaurant too family style is the way to go here great deal lots of good food and the service was great the chocolate cake is super rich and the cheesecake is lighter then most which was a nice finisher the best dish was the lagasana and for appatizer the calamari was worth ordering again i would stick to the pasta entries or the shrimp preferably impressive impressive this is rock solid italian comfort food for sure couples night out and we opted for the family style menu options for a party of four you can pick three starters four main dishes and two desserts we selected the mozzarella calamari and italian tossed salad all three items were great and plentiful the fried mozzarella was my favorite one but the salad and dressing were just as good for entrees we ordered all pasta items with the standouts being the lasagna and manicotti dishes for dessert we tried the chocolate cake and cheesecake im not a chocolate person so i didnt try it but the cheesecake was devine we actually ended up with two pieces to match the size of the chocolate cake portions are huge enough for really the bread was also really yummy with balsamic and oil i think this will be a regular stop on future vegas trips this was a great dining experience the food here is very good here however i left a prior bad review but upon my second visit and explaining what my issue was i taken cared of as if i were a princess this place doesnt even deserve the one star first we werent given menus or water until we had been seated at the hightop in the bar area for minutes the waitress was terrible she had zero customer service skills she never asked us if our food was good if we wanted refills on water or even dessert overall i found service to be very sub par throughout vegas everyone that works in the hospitality industry there gives off this air of entitlement anyways she got what she deserved there are plenty of other restaurants in vegas to get good food and bad service skip this one we made a reservation here and they had no problem seating us when we arrived hours earlier the staff was very friendly and waitress provided great service the food came out quickly and we surprised with the large portions everything tasted really great too highly recommend this place was amazing from finish to end service is great and plates are worth the price good for sharing only bad thing i can say is that the tables were really close to each other really disappointing went here with my wife for a date night out first our hostess a businesss first impression was too busy reading a book to pay attention to anything going on around her including guests waiting but she did at least put the book inside one of your wine lists to try and make it look like she had been studying that hmmm need to work on being conspicuous next we were sat and about minutes later were greeted i think his name was dave very blah attitude and so quiet when talking that we could not hear anything he was saying and very very slow service we had ordered our drinks peach ice tea and raspberry lemonade which tasted like pure syrup we ordered the tomato soup a caesar salad and the bruschetta of which he recommended which had bacon ricotta and arugula this was pretty good the bread that we got your complementary bread he had dropped off at table with olive oil we had wanted balsamic but could not find our server and couldnt get hostess attention too busy with her book tomato soup tastes out of a can and was watery with one salad crouton in really it took the server a good minutes just to come back to get our entree order we ordered the chicken and shrimp baked pasta and a carbonara for my wife the carbonara came out had good flavor but sauce was really thin and plate set up was on a inch oval very poor presentation looked like a sample amount mine had zero sauce and was bland chicken tastes like it was boiled in a pot we were never checked back on to see how things were defiantly was a strike out for this restaurant we have never dined here before but was told in the past that food was good food service and hospitality was not worth the meal we were looking for italian and this place was easy walking distance from the trump international so we gave it a shot the decor is nice they managed to make this place look older than it is the staff seemed well prepared and efficient but this place really gets packed i recommend making a reservation otherwise you may wait minutes or more the only thing that was a bit off was that they had a live guitaristsinger walking around the tables he was a nice guy but he made us a bit uncomfortable not knowing if we were supposed to tip we enjoyed our meal and the price was reasonable if this place were in hawaii id go back for sure amazing food the bacon brushetta appetizer was to die for amazing service by our waitress nicole cannot recommend this place highly enough food was yummy as always love the chopped salad then gotta get mushroom ravioli it was delicious save room for the chocolate cake because it is to die for yummy ive tried to recreate it but cant get it right our service wasnt the greatest but it was still decent thus meal was one of the better meals we had this weekend plans s it was cheaper than a few carry out type meals crazy quick tips for my yelp friends ask for the today and tomorrow special and you will receive an entree for today and one to go which is awesome ive always liked the food here big portions reasonable price youre looking for a place to take your family and have a good italian food maggianos just the place to be so i give this place stars because thats what they are in my book very disappointed went there to try to have lunch but hostess turned down a simple request to seat next to the window because the section is closed according to her sat down and no one even approach us to offer drinks or let us know that someones going to be with us when there was two women right in front of us doing nothing but chatting to each other waitress finally arrived and was having an issue about being rushed to attend to us when shes not even clocked in brought the issue to the manager and he was nice enough to give it an effort to correct the bad experience that we had he even said we can seat us at the closed station and he will send a different server to us but were already on our way out of the place hope they will not say no to their guest and try to satisfy them no matter what we are locals and generous tippers we could have been regulars if we only got treated good by the lunch staff very sad we went yesterday for my sisters birthday and we ordered from the lunch family style menu which is basically buffet style the last time we were here were a few years ago and it seems like they changed up the menu because we were able to chose more dishes before and now we are limited to items per category so you get to chose salad appetizer pastas and desserts for per person it use to be for each i believe my aunt was really disappointed they come out with the first plate and if you want more you order nd or rds according to how many people want extra they do allow for you to take things home but theyve become quite strict on finishing the first plate first they do have gluten free penne pasta so i was able to eat that we ordered the caesar salad calamari clams and linguine gluten free baked ziti tiramisu and the double fudge brownie the salad was a huge let down the lettuce was super soggy the calamari was awesome light batter and fried to perfection everyone who had the clams said the first dish was too salty and the second dish that came out was way better the baked ziti had sausage in it and i usually love sausage but i didnt care for theres the tiramisu was delicious and the brownie dish came with ice cream and strawberries my nephew and i had the strawberries while everyone else ate the super chocolatey brownie it was nice to get together with family and eat a buffet without having to get up our server was nice but could have came around just a tab bit more of us met up for a double date lunch and had a fabulous waitor named robert he was very friendly and shared our interests of traveling stories it was my first time at this location our meals were delcious and temperatures were perfect when delivered to the table portion sizes were appropriate as well i look forward to trying another maggianos soon thank for a great experience maggianos is the place that if my friends and i want to treat ourselves to some high quality italian food we make a reservation we always do family style which is where its at but you have to have a party of or more so we get a good size group pay the a person then eat until we get our moneys worth and can hardly get out of our chairs with family style the order includes a salad appetizers entrees and desserts here are the must gets salad caesar salad apps calamari fried mozzarella trey treys chicky chicky parm parm mushroom raviolis fettuccini alfredo zerts new york cheesecake creme brulee in the past my experience with the waiters and waitresses has been nice with them continuing to bring out food when asked for more with it being all you can eat family style and all i had friends in town for thanksgiving break who had never been to las vegas so i called and made a reservation for us there was of us at the table and our waitress vanessa was really stingy and cheap with the amount of food she brought out for us she took forever to bring out the food when we asked for more and would try and talk us out of being hungry i love maggianos but next time i go i will make sure vanessa is not my waitress we love coming here its one of our favorite places our waiter really knew his stuff my wife has a gluten free diet and its hard to go anywhere but our waiter assured us we were in the right place and shared the gluten free options my wife had a great meal and mine was delicious as well were very happy good food to share family style nice private room for people with a nice view better than your normal italy style chain restaurant but wouldve have given a better rating if the courses came quicker between the apps and the main course overall really good dining experience incredible flavors incredible atmosphere and incredible service await you where italian cuisine is done just right from the starter bread to your meal everything is prepared and presented at this location with tantalizing beauty my baked ziti was warm flavorful and perfectly cheesy tasted just great without sausage moms spaghetti was just as phenomenal with rich marinara and basil so even if you play it safe and stick with spaghetti youll still have an unforgettable experience our host kevin was down to earth and engaging and we went in an hour and a half before closing with a great view of the fashion show mall and the wynn to top it all off bartender was just as spectacular a little pricey plates start at about but well worth it as it tastes better than buca and olive garden combined portions are hefty too if its within your budget give this maggianos a try this is one of the best italian restaurant in las vegas i have never had bad food here i would highly recommend this place if you live italian food service was good bread good view excellent had chicken marsala and it was tough its not that hard to cook chicken kinda disappointed had been excited to go and i probably wont go back better local italian restaurants in the las vegas valley why stars i really wanted to like this place especially that it had a nice seating area with the mall though and the waiter service was really excellent though the food i wasnt expecting this from a yelp stars rated restaurant i took the lamb loin and my wife took the salmon salad both of our plates were less than average i was really disappointed by the taste and the texture of the lamb and the salmon i wondered the freshness of this fish and meat additionally along with the lamb came some mashed potatoes that had literally no taste my review in other words the chef has a lot of room for improvement the food was great and the server gave helpful advice we really enjoyed our first visit at this maggianos their moscato monitor was amazing i really liked the stuffed mushroom but didnt stand out from other places for me such as buca di beppo we ordered the lobster alforno lobster mac n cheese and frutti di mare the pastas were good but didnt quite stand out the hostesses were friendly would recommend you to check out this place for yourself i honestly hated this place the shrimp scampi was a waste of money also the lite fetachinisorry its spelt wrong sauce was really bad the only good thing about it was the bread in the beginning sat at bar they werent even busy waited mins to order they didnt even wipe the bar or remove previous customers drinks after min wait they asked what we ordered they didnt even put our order in we got up and left absolutely horrible service completely unacceptable for vegas service will never go there again this is easily the best italian restaurant on the strip they have a great happy hour and very reasonable prices by vegas standards our server stephanie was lovely and made several excellent wine and food recomemdations i had an app and entree of their specials list both of which were outstanding and overflowing with lobster the ingredient of the day sadly we were too full for dessert but we had such an amazing meal that i didnt even miss it as my so rolled me out the door nice view if you get a window seat so so service good food i like to come here once in a while for the stuffed mushrooms calamari lobster carbonara and the dessert sampler which is great we came in with a party of around pm we ordered the lamb special which was delicious gnocchi and lighter side fettuccine and lasagna was delicious the service and food was amazing even though i live in vegas this is still one of my favorite places to eat request a window view or sit outside if the weather permits they have a happy hour which is nice and the food is delicious maggianos is a solid italian restaurant but it is a little pricy it is located in the fashion mall which probably warrants the higher prices but i just did not think the quality was worth the extra the menu should have stated they have a private elevator to get up to the restaurant which is nice and dont lose your hostess when they lead you to your table this place is huge and a maze i came here for lunch and we began with complimentary bread given it was lunch there was a lunch special for half a sandwich soup or salad pick two some people tried this at my table but it did not look the most appetizing i tried the gnocchi with sausage the pasta was cooked perfectly but the sausage was not the greatest as far as flavor the sauce was quite good though overall if you are craving italian while at the fashion mall then maggianos will do but it is pricey and probably wont bring you back to little italy in terms of flavor i have been to maggianos many many times and have enjoyed their salads desserts fried calamari fried zucchini linguini with clams and shrimp pasta they were all excellent however i just tried the lobster carbonara based on all the pictures and recommendations here on yelp and i was severely disappointed my dish had hardly any lobster there were minuscule pieces here and there and that was it the dish was mostly bacon and peas the peas were good but i was looking for the lobster where was the lobster i have seen in the yelp photos was i just there on a bad day where the cook said forget it no lobster for you cumulatively i dont think there was an inch of lobster in the whole dish seriously i would never order this dish again ill be back for the other items though but this was a mistake oh yeah service is always great but minus one star for the forgettable lobster pasta dish order the clams or the shrimp its still my favorite italian restaurant in vegas though i know this is a chain but their chicken parm was excellent large chicken breasts good sauce and pasta service was okay the vegas location is located in a mall we were there on a sat night and it was not too busy but it was the day after christmas the calamari was good as well crispy not soggy very good all in all a good place to get a good plate of pasta terrible hosting staff not friendly paged us to be sat so we gave the host our pager and then she asked us to stand by a door that was crowded just for a manager to ask after we were waiting if we were sent up when i said yes he asked for our name and our party size and then walked away and didnt come back after a hostess comes up asking for our party but the name wasnt us she kept saying the last name of our party but could t confirm the size just for the party name not to even be kim the party waiting next to me that was sent to this door was also as frustrated as my party finally a third person asked us if we were paged to the front asked our name looked puzzled so she went to the ladies that sent us to the door eureka they figured out how to seat us and we passed multiple tables our size that were open to fit my size group how can hostesses and manager no figure out reservation and seating our server was delayed to greet us but friendly when she did unfortunately first impressions are everything called in for a birthday for my twins th and asked for a window and called back day of and asked again for a good view we were stuck in the bar in a loud area very noisy no view and the food was cold the chicken was over cooked and they did nothing special for my twins bday no birthday wish or surprise wont be back food menu changed and not the same quality as it was a year ago very dispointed we did a pre fix menu because that was our only option with people food was ok gnocchi w sausage was alil salty veal parm needed to pounded out it was way to thick for veal chicken marsala i was told was good but not enough chicken was given for everyone to try some pasta dish came out but still not sure what it was maybe it had some meatball or sausage in it but it wasnt a red sauce n it was very bland stuffed mushrooms were stuffed with only bread crumb which was ok i guess chef gave us a really nice bruschetta platter which was great n our apple n brownies were great as well i am disappointed in the fact that we were unable to order separate dinners we are not big fans of eating off of plates that others have their hands in and being that its cold n flu season it was just not a good idea i manage to get my husband dinner served from the kitchen but the waiter seem annoyed n recommended that i just scoop his first well i refused n insisted he get his from the kitchen anyway it all worked out we enjoyed the rest of the evening but will never do a pre fixed meal again this is a decent italian classy joint the restaurant is super roomy and does host happy hour i think that menu needs to be revisited we love the atmosphere for group dinners or even with a small group of friends the food is always fresh and the service is friendly came her for my birthday and everything was amazing food was delicious i recommended the lighter option drinks were above average the view was amazing and the wait staff was one of the best ive seen in awhile plus i received a complimentary dessert plate for my birthday thank you terrible servicio de parte de la hostess llegamos de personas de nuestro grupo y nos dijo que no nos daba la mesa hasta que llegue el quinto el restaurante estaba casi vacio dijo que nos daba una mesa de y cuando llegue el quinto lo sentaba en otra mesa nos nego hablar con el gerente came in on and the service was amazing as we walked in there was a crowd of people and there were two hostess at one computer and they had crowd control on lock there were two gentlemenmanagers maybe who assisting the lovely hostesshe had glasses dark hair handled everything calmy but quickly and sat us next to a window like we requested super friendly moved rather quickly nice seeing management help out our server was nice gave run through of menu gave suggestions weve been maggianos before and other locations and vegas takes food and host staff were great update to the below have eaten at maggianos since my last review and my husband ordered the fra diavolo again turns out last time he accidentally got the lighter fare option which is why it was so small the regular portion is a good size the linguine di mare is still twice the size though delicious italian food in the fashion show mall on the strip nice setting and great service a word of warning the portion sizes are drastically different between entrees check with your server what size the entree you want is i ended up with a massive portion and my husbands dish was tiny linguini di mare is delicious huge and full of seafood shrimp fra diavolo is good but small maggianos is always a stop for us when we are in vegas consistently great food and wine stopped in yesterday to hang out and enjoy some vino while my better half shopped and surprise did not realize they had a pour happy hour super place to eat and now also to kill time if i need to received a call from the manager he said that he was very sorry for the reservation problem and also about the food experience and offered us to come back and mention his name and they will make sure that it will be one of our favorite experience and restaurant again thank you maggianos i came here with my family before work one day everything i ate was so flavorful i think i almost cried when i ate the dessert because i had never had anything like it the waiter was very personable and the service was great i would definitely come back stellar food once again incredible ambiance and kristy made the evening absolutely magical she went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure moms and my experience was immaculate a pleasure and honor to meet her the chicken and truffle tortellaci is a must try if you enjoy creamy dishes try that one youll be in heaven i promise we come to maggianos every time we visit vegas the zucchini as an appetizer is a must the lunch specials are great as well bottle of wine billed not worth it good customer service but could find better food in vegas amazing food the bread omg the bread its warm and addictive moms lasagna is perfect the cheese ravioli melts in your mouth great price about a plate and well worth it some of the best food i have had in vegas for the price i was staying at the wynn hotel very expensive food expensive does not make it good walk across the street and have one of the best meals of italian food the ambiance was so cozy i ate pasta with chiken and my husband chose chiken with epinard it was soooo delicious yummy amazing food prices and great experience cece was an excellent server prompt polite and helpful i had then steak and ravioli and my wife had the chicken alfredo both were awesome also best long island ice tea ive ever had and the peach bellini were just as amazing we are thrilled there is a location in washington where we live so we can enjoy the awesome experience all over again thank you maggianos for a great experience i am a repeat regular at this restaurant i made reservations about days ago this is my first review of this restaurant the wine is good food is fantastic but it took our server minutes to greet my girlfriend and i i requested a table by the window of las vehas blvd since its valentines day and i get sat in the back of the restaurant and yes i did request to be sat there on my reservations service could use some work also took my server about minutes to just bring our drinks and the bread was cold other experiences were great but not this one also waited on our food for minutes and other people who got here after us were getting their food before us this one star is specifically for the tall server guy that sauntered over to our table to take the balsamic dressing that i asked for from our table sarcastically remarking well thats why i ask first is there a shortage of balsamic to cause such atrocious behavior i also saw another server type just take the balsamic vinegar from another table of four guests ill leave out the race notation herewithout saying anything to them he just walked over to their table lifted the sauce and walked away i do not appreciate this type of behavior completely overshadowed our hostess superior service kristy was exceptional and should be commended for her attitude and service maybe valentine day overwhelmed the kitchen and that it why our order was hours late and not what i ordered waiter apparently knew it was wrong order but did not want kitchen to correct it and have us wait longer waiter did offer us free dessert i wished i left it i ordered double chocolate brownie the brownie was dry and tasted bad the strawberries were still frozen only thing good about it was the ice cream we were there for three hours we had reservations and it took them minutes to seat us we placed our order fairly promptly and then waited for the wrong meal another minutes for terrible dessert and more minutes to pay the bill not the valentines dinner i had hoped for we went here for our valentines dinner last night and man was it busy this is a very popular strip restaurant for good reason the servers struggled a little because of the volume of customers but held up pretty well all things considered i had the veal marsala which was some of the best ive had and the wife had a chicken and potatoes dish that was equally tasty this was a very nice meal even as busy as it was good job guys on a challenging night for restaurants the executive chef here is a lying acehole ps they have a severe cock roach problem the health department hides this i use to work here stay away came here for lunch after shopping at the fashion show mall excellent service and great tasting food ordered the stuffed mushrooms for appetizer main entree was lasagna and mushroom stuffed ravioli arlene our server was very attentive and quick with her service my wife and i had our reception here the staff was incredible and so on top of things everyone had nothing but great things to say the food was great as well i cannot recommend having an event at maggianos absolutely amazing best meal of our trip eric was our waiter and his service was wonderful love the from scratch kitchen we got the rigatoni lasagna lobster pasta and steak special best part it was one of our less expensive dining experiences will definitely be back best italian food in vegas i had salad spaghetti lasagna fettuccine ravioli and dessert family style with of my best friends we loved it service was great too i had prom here and made a reservation for people service is pretty okay but whats my favorite part is the buffet family style deals you really do get a bang for your buck here thats saying a lot for the strip food was great i got the sausage ziti and my wife selected the salmon it has been a long time since i ate at this restaurant and ill have to come back soon decor is classy old vegas with a polished feel very clean service professionals were just that professional engaging and friendly food was very good we had the chefs special all around only draw back was the wait for our food but it was busy so really not a problem ernesto our host and kevin our waiter were both on point kevin was especially helpful and even accommodated a appetizer swap military discount eased the bill classy place good food would go back i came here with a large group and we dined family style i am not a huge italian food fan as i am allergic to dairy i wasnt really looking forward to the dinner but it definitely exceeded my expectations i shared with our waiter that i couldnt eat dairy and one of the chefs came out and personally presented me with dairy free options at each course i felt very special and understood not to mention completely satisfied and full at the end the hospitality here made what is usually an unpleasant issue something great definitely recommend this place good italian food and great service really makes this location stand out maggianos is in the fashion show mall and has a large restaurant and bar area you can eat at the bar with a full menu the food is hot and fresh and the servers are really on their game they know what to recommend they know what they like and they really help you with your food and wine selections the service is really really good they have a full italian menu plus steaks and seafood you can even order large dishes to share aka family style there is usually a chefs selection or two on the menu and last night i had the chefs shells stuffed with italian beef covered in a red sauce it was wonderful while the food is excellent the wine list was just so so there could be a few more wines by the glass on the wine list in my opinion example they had an average pinot noir by the glass on the menu and no oregon pinots by the glass the wine list might need a bit of a tune up the restaurant although very large fills up quickly there was quite a wait on a sunday night and the bar was packed so it is best to get a reputation the prices and quality of the food is very good and the service is outstanding had a wonderful time at this restaurant with several friends the service was prompt and the food was very good the restaurant has every patron in public view and is slightly noisy being in the middle of the strip the prices for the seafood dishes wine and other drinks were within the norm of expectations for this kind of restaurant we had a great time and the experience helped us to have a wonderful evening the entire experience was excellent our server liz was very welcoming attentive i had the egg plant parmigiana it was perfect the best i ever had thus far my husband had the shrimp scampi and he loved it we celebrated my birthday and liz brought over a delicious cheese cake with lemon cookies it was amazing adored the ambiance waiters and customer service when i had dinner here with family my favorite dish was their meat lasagna my least favorite dish was their cheese stuffed ravioli the service was great but the food was not so cheap food at a high price it tasted very generic and was way overpriced i tried to make a reservation for christmas eve first i got transferred to a mailbox that was full and when i called back i talked to or people and waited for several minutes until they told me that they were unable to make a reservation for at pm thats not how to win friends and influence people it was disappointing to start from the beginning we were waiting one of the waiter just was looking at us and ignoring us we didnt know where hostess was then we found out that she was in the middle of the restaurant so we sat outside view was good our waiter was kinda lost he didnt know the menu good and he was pushing the specials so we got chicken florentine specials which wasnt good chicken was dry and tasteless we also ordered pasta with meatball and fried calamari sauce on pasta was too much fried calamari was perfectly cooked food came out fast paid for two including one glass of wine and tips i dont think i will go there again if youre bad with directions then this restaurant is a little hard to find the restaurant looks pricey on the outside but all items on the menu have very reasonable prices a few days ago while me and my boyfriend were in vegas we decided to try out this restaurant i got the light take chicken alfredo and let me tell ya with a little dash of pepper it tasted amazing the customer service was nothing short of amazing either we were acknowledged by almost every employee our waitress refilled our glasses timely and was very courteous she made our experience enjoyable maggianos knows how to pick the right people for the job heather was an awesome waitress and her bubbly personality topped it off i recommend this restaurant while in vegas this was yet another visit to maggianos on our nephews birthday for a pleasing authentic italian dinner this time the repast was more colorful than usual with an entree of lobster carbonara accented by reds and greens and a green flecked chicken piccata punctuated by capers and a light lemon sauce as usual entree portions were large with ample portions of veal parmesan bathed in white alfredo sauce and my sizable medallions of veal marsala covered in sweet dark brown marsala sauce and topped by uncharacteristic but chompingly enjoyable button mushrooms but i get ahead of myself our meal began with two fine starters tender rings and tentacles of golden brown calamari fritti served with a classic marinara sauce and specially prepared lemon aioli for dipping along with large rectangles of thick and cheesy mozzarella marinara a side caesar with creamy caesar dressing and several croutons was a nice bridge to the aforementioned mains and we finished with an assortment of unexpected complimentary birthday desserts including tasty tiramisu and italian half moon cookies service was spot on this time and the view of wynn just across the street from our faux leather booth added some vegas pizzazz to the comfy red white checked tableclothed and family celebratory ambiance of this old school italian ristorante this time service was spot on the skinny for italian food is okay but are skimpy on portion sizes for the price service prompt and efficient baby friendly they do have a changing station in the family bathroom and their booth can accommodate an infant car seat strollers are parked away from the tables value for the level of cuisine it is definitely overpriced if i were to sum up what the feeling was after leaving maggianos it would be an overpriced upscale olive garden dont get me wrong the food is definitely better as is the service but the prices seemed exorbitant for what it was we ordered a plate of fried zucchini a lunch special half chicken parmesan sandwich and half caesar salad and a plate of gnocchi the fried zucchini was a bit greasy and the coating was too heavy the ranch dressing was relatively bland and lacked acidity for it was a smaller portion than i expected the lunch special with a half portion of a soup salad or sandwich for i got the chicken parm sammy with a half caesar salad the caesar salad was pretty generic and generally uninteresting there was no garlicky lemony anchovy punch at all the chicken parmesan sandwich was very skimpy on the chicken parm and could have used more marinara the gnocchi fared better the gnocchi was soft and not overly gummy however the sauce it was paired with was overly salty and needed more acidity to lighten the dish service was good and prompt our water glasses remained filled and our foodcheck came quickly for families they do have a changing station in the family bathroom which is hovering over the toilet there is no private area to breastfeed strollers are parked around the hostess station while an infant car seat can fit in one of the booths overall the joint is okay in my books the level of cuisine certainly does not merit the lofty prices they charge but then again this restaurant is on the strip starred review we were here for a wedding reception so not sure if food would be better off the menu nothing was bad just nothing great im not a big family style eating guy service was efficient but not outstanding we will be back to dine from the menu bar area was great as soon as my aunt mom and myself sat down my mom told me that something was spilled by the last guest which made her shoes all sticky that was such a turn off it took a good minutes to clean it up before my mom could sit down after that fiasco was over we ordered a few dishes to share started with the caprese salad and had the linguine clams prime delmonico steak for our main course all of the dishes were great and perfect for the of us to share id hope that the restaurant makes sure each table to clean before seating new guests because the food was good id definitely come back again and possibly change my review enjoy although this is located right off of las vegas blvd its a place missed by many people great italian food and the service that ive had there is been impeccable the place is much larger than it looks when you first come in there is an entire series of banquet halls in the back for private events i overheard what looked like one of the banquet managers talking to the team that was getting ready for a reception they seem very organized and caring about the event we made a last minute dinner reservation on a wednesday night and managed to find a table it was pretty busy for a wednesday night i ordered the mushroom ravioli and it was really good though a little too sweet for my liking so i added crushed red pepper to enhance the taste a a bit between three of us we ordered a white wine sangria and it was horrible it barely had any wine in it we could only taste sprite and the pitcher was quite small for the value however the food was great warm and quick our server was great and kept checking on us every now and then nice view from nd floor good food especially the chopped salad and simple pasta with sausage not too expensive considering vegas prices love maggianos hated everything about the service i received today jose our waiter was by far the worst he was not attentive left us waiting for long the restaurant was not busy it was in the afternoon i would visit again because the food alone is worth it food was fantastic as always as well as our server mac only bad thing was i made reservations said we would be celebrating a birthday double checked with the host when we got there that it was in the notes not once were we acknowledged for my grandmas birthday i went with maggianos solely on the reviews of fellow yelpers and brides everywhere online id never eaten here prior but im a little risk taker and figured that hundreds of honest reviews cannot be wrong i was so right we had our reception in the dicarlo room on small crowd ppl and a dance floor wa dj i honestly cannot say enough good things about this place the decor old world italian think s which went great with my wedding theme of tea length dresses and fedoras the service our waitstaff was very attentive and very friendly our server kept making sure that we were all full with food and drinks in hand the food omg this was some of the best id ever had it was family style we decided to go with the milano package which included hour open bar of premium liquor and various wine appetizers salads pasta main course and desert we had so much food that we ended up leaving with trays of to go items that we just ate for dinner last night thank god we had a dj to work off the food the nitty gritty im not sure if this goes for all the rooms but to book a room dicarlo there is a minimum of that needs to be spent if your food package is less than that amount you can always use dj svs cakes decorations etc as part of the minimum if booked through maggianos which is awesome they do charge a event fee before tax for the private room used additional gratuity is optional as your waitstaff is paid at a higher rate for your event highly recommended for someone like myself who is a total control freak these amazing coordinators maggianos took care of everything that was required to make this day memorable thank you thank you thank you the family style meal is amazing it allows you to try different menu items the ravioli rigatoni d and the chocolate banana bread pudding were favorites it was my birthday lunch and they gave me a really nice dessert plate plus the chef antipasti is worth the whole trip loved the view of the strip the staff is friendly and attentive i always have a special time ive always loved maggianos and was ecstatic to find it was still open at pm yesterday the waitress wanted to know if we wanted our dishes spicy and i said sure a little when our plates come out it was literally covered with crashed red pepper my mouth was burning and it was completely inedible i had to pour water over my food to wash some of the crushed red pepper off the waitress never stopped by to ask how things were the other dish also drowned in crushed red pepper was seafood and definitely not fresh nor was the sauce okay they were closing in an hour but if im paying full price for food i expect fresh food not drowned in pepper to mask old seafood wasted and had to pay for another meal elsewhere great scratch style italian food big portions and excellent customer service we ate outside to enjoy the wonderful weather it was amazing next time ill try eating in because the place like amazing if your looking for good homemade scratch style italian food this is your place my brother gave me a gift card for my birthday so we came here for lunch we had the fried mozzarella to start and we ordered linguini de mares and i had chicken parmigiana the linguini was excellent it was a good lunch service was good also seriously wonderful service the food was amazing and great atmosphere definitely coming back we had a great waiter eric and that made the experience even better wow what happened to this place worst service i have ever had at maggianos my party had to grab the attention of our server on several occasions such as to refill our empty glasses of water everything came out all at once so our table had no room for our appetizers cold bread and our meals oh and we had no dinner ware i guess they expected us to eat with our hands why not we were being treated like barbarians so why not eat like one so once again we had to flag someone for dinnerware since our server disappeared on us the menu had changed drastically since we were here last i think we would have had a better deal ordering italian from pizza hut and probably received better service am i being too harsh not after spending all that money on what is supposedly upscale italian granted they seemed to have two very large events going on but that is no excuse for providing us with lack luster food and service i am taking maggianos off my list of places to bring family and friends from out of town love this place started dining here two years ago and come back at least twice each trip we always ask for vanessa because shes an awesome server with a great personality the chef eric anderson even came out to see how we liked the food great food great prices great service love ya vanessa see you next year everything was perfect early evening pre show light dinner starting with sis in laws lemon drop and my peach bellini which i received as requested on the rocks instead of frozen while the lemon drop was excellent sis had a little bellini envy going on for sure we had a calamari and shrimp appetizer which was plenty big enough to share and was served on a colorful bed of greens with a light dressing sis had the caesar salad shrimp which she has had before and loves i went for the spinach salad and it was perfect no need to add anything as bacon and pine nuts were liberally applied service was excellent and happy great location great food great dining experience best food i have ever had seriously from the service to the food and the atmosphere everything was amazing it was a party of and we ordered family style which means we get two appetizers pastas different entrees and desserts it was a total of for people with amazing bread to start off our meal also the drinks were comp off of the check since we ordered family style can you say great will definitely be back here soon only regret was not going in sooner lol excellent service and the food was good the cheese ravioli was my favorite and their brownie and ice cream was delicious the view of the strip the service the drinks and the food were great its nicely decorated dont have any complains i had a terrible experience here my mother and law came here for lunch our server jose was almost never to be found nor was he ever at other tables another server was helping us out a good chunk of the time but then at the end of the meal when he dropped the check he made an inappropriate comment to my mother in law i will not be coming back to this location any time in the future came in on and the service was amazing as we walked in there was a crowd of people and there were two hostess at one computer and they had crowd control on lock there were two gentlemenmanagers maybe who assisting the lovely hostesshe had glasses dark hair handled everything calmy but quickly and sat us next to a window like we requested super friendly moved rather quickly nice seeing management help out our server was nice gave run through of menu gave suggestions weve been maggianos before and other locations and vegas takes food and host staff were great horrible i ordered to go and the portions were really sad the side of asparagus had strands in it what a rip off the flatbread wasnt fully cooked it was raw and the cheese not fully melted i would have taken it back except i stayed at encore and didnt walk to walk all the way back over will likely not go back and for sure never ever take out very good this was our th visit and the service was amazing we had a party of seven for a birthday party the food was good and the table was right in the corner over looking the strip we had the stuffed mushrooms linguine di mare caesar salad and peroni beer with red wine very yummy excellent service and food arrived with a reservation requested the outside area seated promptly received complimentary bread our server was on point we ordered calamari and mozzarella for appetites both was great main dishes was famous d rigatoni and alfredo fettuccine good the alfredo was plain though just noodle no pieces of chicken in it the gf didnt like it as much price is much cheaper then on the strip restaurants bill came out to for some reason the ice water was so good haha we got the stuffed mushrooms which were delicious and the shrimp scampi which is a huge portion and also very yummy had lots of flavor and we got one of their flatbreads i believe the chicken red pepper flat bread which was also very good i will give the maggiano five stars i loved the location so if you get hungry while you shop this is a perfect place also the food was great its all made to order so there is a little wait but its worth it because its fresh i dont remember my servers name but he was very knowledgeable friendly and funny it was my aunts birthday and they brought her a surprise cake but no loud song and i was fine with that everything was great my friends and i a group of came in around on a reservation we planned on eating really quick and leaving as closing is at but we ended up staying longer until around and the servers didnt mind at all the service was amazing out of the waiters were checking up on us and asking us how our prom was and cracking jokes and was the best part of the night they got one of my friends orders wrong but it was alright as she didnt mind and we were all too hungry to wait for them to get her original order the food was out of the serving sizes are huge and i could barely eat any of it before i asked for a take out box this prompted everyone to say that they wanted some too and the server ended up giving all of us boxes along with take out boxes for desert without prompting from us i got the cheese ravioli and although there are only about ravioli on the plate they are huge yet oh so delicious and fresh out of the oven that the plate was still burning hot desert was amazing i got the new york style cheesecake and while it was small because i was doing a prom promo it was still amazing it wasnt as dense as a normal cheesecake would be and with our stomachs full from the main dish that was perfect my daughter brought me here tonight for mothers day from start to finish everything was perfect martin was our server very attentive chef heikisp was on point tonightit was nice meeting you chef i will definitely be returning ive had decent meals here usually with a few other couples and a few adult beverages this time with the family it was a different story my advice beware if you order any beef dish i ordered the braised beef pappardelle with garlic mashed potatoes as a side waiter didnt tell me that it came over pasta and it only came with a small amount of shredded beef or did it because i never got the mashed potatoes and the description mentioned nothing about pasta it had obviously been left under a heat lamp because the plate rim was very hot the food was only warm and the sauce had started to congeal i ate maybe a third of it and the bus boy came by and started clearing the dishes what am i going to do complain to him my daughter ordered the filet with asparagus risoto a bunch of under cooked asparagus a reasonable amount of risoto and little slices ounces of well done beef filet about the size of your little finger by the way she ordered it pink which after verbally stumbling around we agreed was medium more signs it sat under a heat lamp husband and i ate here today for the first time food is amazing had lobster carbonara sausage soup and mini desert sampler all were great and no complaints we ate on the patio and it was a nice view our server was wonderful and we are going back tomorrow to try other menu selections maggianos has been a favorite of ours for some time now the food and service has always been consistently good over the last few years we have eaten here several times and never been disappointed the price is right around average for mainstream american chains such as cheesecake factory but the quality is a bit better than most in this category while this is no gourmet celebrity chef italian restaurant it doesnt really pretend to be it does what it sets out to do provide quality value and a nice atmosphere for families looking to enjoy a night out we just attended a party on the patio at maggianos over the weekend and it was amazing the service was absolutely on point with food drinks and any question u wanted to ask it was outstanding how they made the guest of honor feel special on her graduation day from unlv that was customer service at its best i loved the views from the patio of the strip the appetizers and food were delicious it was a comfortable setting and a great place to celebrate hats off the the servers that evening we placed an order for takeout and my husband went to pick it up we had the lasagna and the four cheese ravioli everything was nice warm and delicious never a disappointment with this place thank you we always have such amazing times here every time we come we always request for nestor his service at our table is phenomenal we also got a lot of food yesterday we got the four cheese ravioli which was super good my boyfriends dad loves that dish and he gets it every time boyfriend got the braised beef pasta thing which was amazing pasta was cooked perfectly and the beef literally melts in your mouth i didnt think that was possible when they say it on tv mom got some sort chicken ravioli or something like that she really like it i got the chicken alfredo was a little disappointing as always it just didnt taste right lol either way the service was so good thatss why im giving a five im sure you dont need my recommendation to go there everything is great there we had only been to the maggianos in chicago never this location on the strip the place was fantastic and our server martin was excellent it has a great atmosphere and friendly staff we will certainly be going back thank you martin may went here to celebrate my sister and nephews birthdays such a great family friendly place with so much variety our server hector was phenomenal he immediately took the order for my nephew turning who was getting anxious because he was hungry and offered appetizers for the table we decided on the family style menu and everything we ordered was awesome i have to come back to hectors service he was so attentive helpful and genuinely seemed like he wanted to be there thank you hector for an awesome family birthday dinner this place is awesome the food is to die for and one of the fairest priced restaurants in vegas located in the second floor of the fashion mall nice viewed the strip cee cee our waitress was an absolute darlin highly recommend this place i have nothing but great things to say about the staff and food here at maggianos as an event planner i have helped organize small events in their private dining areas and the service is always incredible i have to say a special thank you to beth and sabrina for their great communication and willingness to go above and beyond i have had so many things to eat here and everything is always delicious the family style meals are also perfect for larger parties you get to try a little bit of everything if you are looking to host a private party or even stop by for some great italian this is your place i had dinner at maggianos tonight n everything was stars the food the service n prices i highly recommend dining at this great establishment maggianos is a little oasis in the desert of vegas when you step inside suddenly youve left the hustle and bustle of the strip and have a place to simply enjoy the food and the service which were both wonderful our server that evening was polite and welcoming it felt like i had a favorite aunt who was there making sure i ate enough because i was too skinny which i am not lol we gave her a big tip and she jovially waved good bye to us as we left the food is great here too the dishes are generously portioned with bold flavors and a great adherence to the heart and soul of traditional italian dishes or at least their americanized version highly recommend taking a trip here if you want a solid dinner at a great restaurant we were told that for party of they will have to take us in for a groupfamily price i forgot the exact term they use about per person with courses to choose from yes its a little pricey but the food is so abundant and delicious everyone is sure to be full will come back again love love this restaurant they have romantic setting looks like a candle light feel they also have a man come around and sing to you my husband and i do love all of their pasta dishes and they do accommodate to any of your dietary needs this place has a look and feel of old italy i have never eaten in this area and there are quite a bit of restaurants surrounding each other we chose the family style service as we had about in our party and it was well worth the we had the salmon with balsamic glaze chicken franchese my personal favorite shrimp scampi tossed salad tiramisu creme brulee i am missing a few items but those are the ones i enjoyed the food was cooked perfectly and the taste maron yummy it helps to have good company our server was knowledgeable and very welcoming definitely will come here again its a bit pricier but the good ones are go you wont be disappointed birthday dinner on the strip cool this place was so good we did the family style dining from the back of the menu highly recommend that because you can try so many different entrees we did calamari yum caesar salad way yum gnocchi omg chicken marsala wow fettuccini didnt try oops chicken parm yummmmm tiramisu amazing oh and dont forget my peach sangria so refreshing and dee lish i really liked this place only negative is that it is so crowded tables are smooshed together and fairly small other than that so good i hope to go back someday the food was excellent this review is for the service our waiter was slow and served other tables promptly that were seated after us apparently having a reservation means absolutely nothing at this place probably wont return to this location if you ever come across a maggianos youve got to stop and have the regatta i d its so amazing great the chicken and carmelo zed onions mmmmmmm also if you like sangria youve got to try it its so refreshing after youve been in the heat i love maggionos i always try to find a reason to dine here chicken parm is good meatball and spaghetti is great and their red sauce just makes it that much better calamari is really yummy not overly breaded or chewy lunch menu has a good chicken parm sandwich salads are good fresh and deliccious dressings now the hot bread they serve i could eat this bread all night with their cheese and balsamic its good they bring it out in small rolls because i would have rolls for days on my thighs i do wish there was a location off the strip in summerlin somewhere weekend wait times are terrible so get a reservation the fried zucchini is one of the best ive ever had with ranch but its just too big to share between two people eat here just do it oh and they usually have a musician walking around asking if you want them to play something if your into that sort of stuff we went here for my son in laws birthday as this is a place we wanted to come to this place is classic vegas and the service is actually pretty good this place does get crowded so a reservation is suggested the food is ok i have never had anything here that i would say was off the charts the prices are a little higher then you will find in other italian places but its a chain and its on the strip the food is cooked good but there are a lot of items that are bland and under seasoned what makes up for the food is the ambiance and i am going to steal this part from my friend and fellow yelper gregg w who said this part best classy rat pack music meticulously clean upscale men wear a suittie or dress it down nicely casual but certainly no flip flips and gym shorts here the dark wood interior walls have some nice old las vegas framed black n white photos tables are white cloth nicely dressed wait staff bathrooms even have cloth towels just a very classy italian restaurant full bar w dining option happy hour specials reservations recommended for seating by floor to ceiling windows or prepare to go shopping and come back and wait some more etc so i say you should visit this place try a few different dishes and share your opinion here on yelp this is not my first choice of a place to get italian food here in vegas but if you like a chain and are familiar with the food and you like it go go go and enjoy its not a bad place by any means just not up to my liking to say it is a favorite of mine this is one of our favorite italian restaurants in vegas great food drinks and deserts and great customer service great food rude disinterested employees we made a reservation via open table but the restaurant was absolutely packed and obviously overbooked person seating us was unable to assist so we just waited around and found a table for ourselves on the outside mall patio waiter was awesome but too busy to pay any attention to us free photographer was seriously annoying and not free incredible for something that should be ordinary as it is a chain restaurant chain restaurants are notorious for food that puts the soul to sleep but maggianos serves toasty hearty delights that nourish service can be a hit or miss most of the time a hit but getting servers on their off days is a possibility especially on a busy night but maggianos stands out above other chain restaurants very nice atmosphere and excellent service drinks never ran out i had the chicken alfredo and my boyfriend had the eggplant parmesan the marinara in the eggplant parm was phenomenal loved the chicken in my alfredo i just really love this place had been waiting and two girls walk in and because they are dressed sluty the manager goes behind us and tells the hostess to sit them fisrt kind of crappy in my book decided to leave waste of my time the restaurant has nice design but its too overpriced the food is not worse the price service was good but our waiter did not follow up his suggestion i will never go there again i got the ravioli and it was amazing my husband got the spaghetti and meatballs which was also amazing seriously everything everyone in my group got was amazing they also had a special menu of items that if purchased would donate funds to make a wish our waiter jose was great funny quick to refill drinks and just overall nice absolutely loved this place best italian food in vegas and the service was excellent fred looked after us from the moment we walked in and he was brilliant always enjoy this place the spaghetti and meat sauce was done perfectly they have perfected the art of cooking pasta where its not over cooked and soggy or too crunchy or hard its fine the way it should be bread is amazing the linguini and clams was also excellent the ambiance is a bit strange because the tables were very close and we sat by bar with various televisions but focusing on food only it was excellent we came here for fathers day and we were very disappointed the restaurant was not busy there were quite a few open tables our server was nice but his service was off i asked for a drink menu and he told me the only thing special they had was a sangria he brought us the wrong salad and took forever to refill our drinks he didnt bring us bread until we were almost finished with our appetizers two of our entrees looked great the chicken fettuccine alfredo looked disgusting the plate wasnt wiped down around the edges and the sauce what little there was looked like it had been sitting for a while there also was no garnish and the whole dish looked messy sad because ive dined here before and have never had a bad experience awesome food only bad was that they sat us down somewhere then moved us around before we got a nice table it was just inconvenient because we were celebrating a birthday other than that everything was good serve was nice food was good as well we are locals and weve been here before with the kids it was very good at that time this time was excellent i had the shrimp and chicken dish with prosciutto with a red pepper sauce highly recommend this dish overall exceptional especially our server mark awesome experience brought staff for dinner while at conference from beginning to end we were extremely happy with our service ambiance and food our server paulo was fantastic he was attentive personal professional and thorough while fun we went family style and everything was delicious antipasti stuffed mushrooms and calamari fritte were all delicious large mushrooms with great filling perfectly fried calamari with delicious marinara sauce so good caesar salad was excellent our entrees fettuccini alfredo and shrimp scampi were delicious nice cream sauce on fettuccini and plenty of perfectly cooked shrimp with lemon and garlic for dessert the creme brulee was creamy smooth and full of flavor under the crackly sugar top we also had the cheesecake which was very good with strawberries check it out when youre in las vegas youll be happy you did gave it a try based on yelp reviews we had a vegi pasta dish and a salmon dish both were very good and the price was very reasonable for such a nice restaurant on the strip good service as well underground parking is just around the corner i should probably just cut and paste a review i have for maggianos in the bay area but that would not be fair to be honest all the maggianos are about the same which is a good thing because i really like their food we had their banquet style menu and the appetizers were great fried calamari salad and stuffed mushrooms the best to kick it off all the entrees were spot on including the salmon cooked perfectly which is hard to do w fish in the large quantities they gave us and the chicken marsala the desserts were heaven the giant chocolate mountain cake at least thats what i call it cause it looks like half dome at yosemite was sweet enough to make you instantly diabetic and the tiramisu was the perfect texture of well tiramisu throw in sangria to add a kick to the night and we are talking one very good meal with great friends happy eating i went to this place on july st for my friends birthday and i loved the environment the service was completely amazing super polite and they were great when it came towards recommending specials and desserts my friend ordered the new york steak and it was delicious the meat was nice and tender and super flavorful i got the chicken parmesan which was nice and crispy they let us know that all the food is made from scratch which i thought was good i did call ahead and made a reservation which came in handy because it looked like they got busy i also let them know in advance it was my friends birthday and at the end of the meal they brought him a little desert with a candle which i thought was really nice i defiantly recommend this place and the environment was very intimate the view was nice we were in the mall and wanted to eat a leisurely lunch this was a great choice our table had a fantastic view of the strip even if you dont want pasta this place still works the bruschetta appetizer had grilled shrimp on top never had seen that but it worked the chopped salad was light and refreshing the environment is good but my lobster carbonara doesnt have lobster at all instead of lobster they put crawfish the server said that they are cutted lobster but i definitely know that they were crawfish i am so disappointed that this big chain restaurant did this kind of thing i will never go back not certain why all the stars i had dinner there last night because it was convenient the food was fair and that is being generous the noodles were way over cooked and the oil used to cook the chicken had no appealing taste i had the chicken francaise that was soaked in a butter sauce no dish should be drowning in a butter sauce the salad had wilted lettuce and over dressed the service i will say was excellent but this in itself is not why i go out for dinner they say this is italian food but cant imagine that any italian would say this is good sauce too many good italian restaurants in the las vegas area to ever go back}
{1599, Juliana Pizza Family Restaurant, 9858 Monroe Rd Arboretum Charlotte NC 28270, julianas is not the most glamorous place in the area but theyve got good food i met some friends here last monday night for a late dinner and it wasnt crowded the staff was accommodating even though i arrived about minutes before they closed the place down im a fan of their veggie sandwich its awfully cheesy and melty other folks with me had pasta dishes which looked and smelled divine the best thing about julianas is that the price is right most menu items were cheaper than so if youre near the sardis crossing shopping center and feeling like getting something to eat thats not from a soul less chain store as they abound in this area check out julianas wouldve liked to have gone three and a half stars here but of course cant cause its just not allowed good food family run good service not crowded inexpensive this is a fine place for lunch or dinner good food great service relaxed laid back atmosphere theyve been around for years and years and the consistency is evident i really like their pizza and their greek salads the greek chicken salad is my favorite here friends have been happy with their burgers my kids devour the pizza stars would be about right ill give them the half star for trying hard to please okay first off the address is monroe rd now that we all can meet up at the right place lets dig in ive eaten twice here now shame on me for not reviewing sooner and what i like most is the atmosphere theyre not too busy but they can accommodate any size group its a family run restaurant and the owners are usually there working hard i love the food italiangreek cuisine with some american on the side the desserts the desserts oh man the chef usually has a special dessert of the day and then you have your typical italian tiramisu cannoli and carrot cake the last time i was there they had this chocolate decadence cake and it was insanely rich and moist i say give them a try because you can bring your friends family etc and have a great meal at a reasonable price ive been there a few times and the hubby and i love the place its inexpensive never busy and the staff is always personable our bill is usually less than for both of us the menu has something for everyone subs pizza wings italian and some greek picks like the chicken pita are listed the hubby likes the chicken parm and i like the chicken pita its worth a visit if you want a quaint non frou frou local place to have a quiet meal juliana pizza is family owned operated and cherished but a wonderful family i live nearby and am now holding my charlotte crocheters club meeting at juliana pizza ursula is the owner i have been working with and she is a shining jewel she greeted us enthusiastically serves the best food ever and offers great cuisine i love the lasagna stuffed rigatoni and the gourmet pizza the desserts are just heavenly if you are into giving your mouth a treat prices are very

and they are very friendly a nice family oriented restaurant this is a hidden gem you must try their old world style spaghetti and meatballs the most wonderful spice hints of cinnamon compliments the most delicious and tender meatballs and theyre fantastically large they also have delicious hot wings not much variety just hot which are really a medium mild but they are flash fried and shaken in sauce not breaded great taste perfect heat for anyone to enjoy including children and good value the pizza is also wonderful get the dressed pizza for great flavor with several kinds of meat peppers olives and onions inexpensive friendly and attentive staff and not crowded yet a must try for this area pizza has a great flavor and the spaghetti with meat sauce has great flavor only too little sauce if you see my photos you may say it looks like a lot the service here is always very good i have to say im a fan because i eat here more than any italian place three and a half stars pizza what pizza it doesnt look smell or taste like pizza but its very good id describe it as a mediterranean puffy pie with your choice of ingredients the standard offerings are of the kitchen sink variety but thats not my style i ordered an individual with cheese mushroom onion and sausage and it was yummy when the waitress brought it to the table i was like what the hell is that i though it was a failed attempt at dip dish pizza but as i ate into it i shed my preconceptions and enjoyed it for what it is very little tomato sauce btw but thats a plus i spoke a little with the owner when i paid shes a real nice person she even said tell me what dish you want and ill make it for you i was having lunch at this location during the holidays and i saw they were delivering dozens of large pizza pies i figured people must like them last week i brought a couple of large pies to feed the men working at my house not only the guys loved it but two of them asked permission to take the leftovers home ive fed employees countless times over the years and this never happened to me before as i mentioned it doesnt look or taste quite like a traditional pizza the dough is some sort of deep dish but nicely crispy i think they use a fair amount of yest to make it rise and stay light its not chi style nor any of the pizza hut concoctions also the tomato sauce is used sparingly which i like i asked the owner about it he told me hes been making pizza for years and everything was prepared in house including the dough sauces etc my favorite still is the individual pie with mushrooms well cooked onions i cant stand undercooked onions a mild sausage more knockwurst than italian and my twist a fried egg on top sunny side up no its not pizza a tuscan style pie maybe btw the lunches are cheap for lasagna ravioli etc more to charlottes taste than to mine but good in spite of being mild warning this place is horrible why here it is my family and i went to this place saturday evening based on the reviews here on yelp and other sites such as urbanspoon of us ordered chicken parmesan a pretty good yardstick for determining how the food is in any italian restaurant after each of us took our first bite we all lookedvat each other with the sort of face you make when you are wondering what was that the look was followed by universal disdain for this so called meal the chicken was inedible the sauce was nothing resembling tomato sauce found on of all italian meals we should have been tipped off when the chicken was grilled not breaded as is the case with this dish bland gross terrible now comes the part that totally caused me to write this we sent it all back we were asked would you like something else not a chance if this was the indicator for the so called cuisine we wanted nothing to do with it the manager came to our table you have to pay for the entire meal seriously seriously now again in of the time when food is returned the normal proper way of doing business is to say sorry you didnt like your food we will deduct the cost from your bill ladies and gentlemen in the face of protecting my family from the embarassment of the police being called i paid for this crap as i left i suggested the manager change this policy it was met with a smirk and defiance in the face of my saying the social media world will hear about this she couldnt care less so here it is for those of you who gave this place a positive review i have to ask seriously for those of you looking for something new in italian food in charlotte you have been warned by someone who rarely sends food back and by someone who understands the customer is always right just moved in the area and discovered on of the best pizzas in charlotte great service and the food is always consistent i also recommend trying the fragolaki sp seasoned grilled steak in a hoagie with feta cheese wow this place has good pizza hidden at the end of a strip plaza it doesnt look like anything special from the outside and its easy to miss once inside the food is good and the service is even better ordered the large pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms they are fresh not from a can and it was excellent one of the best pizzas ive had in charlotte our server was very good always filled our drinks before they went dry came back often to see if we needed anything and was fast with the bill when we were finished dont let the outside appearance stop you from giving this place a try i know ill be back best pizza and wings in the queen city nice place for a date or hang with friends service is awesome i will be back for sure i am confused i am baffled i am in shock i am disappointed when i read the reviews i was a little surprised but i figured somehow i must have looked over this place after all these years and i was actually regretting it now not so much i quickly realized there was a reason i grew up right around the corner yet never visited this place i realized there was a reason i never even stepped foot in this place on a lunch break while working at the neighboring food lion as a squeaky teenager with braces back then i thought ragu was gourmet so i wasnt even picky but still knew to stay away from julianas there is a reason why our italian family of never bothered ordering from here even though it was cheap and close by you have to realize this was before the restaurant scene really even popped off in charlotte there were no options uptown was downtown the arboretum was for the wealthy and ballantyne didnt exist but still julianas was never an option now i see why we opened the door and immediately fell back into the diner feel of this place gave me the creeps and the whole restaurant turned to stare as we entered it was awkwardly quiet and just didnt have a comfortable feel at all i wanted to leave from the moment i stepped in but i figured i needed to get over myself and give it a try sometimes the best food comes out of little hole in the wall restaurants i wasnt expecting much but i realize decor is not the only thing that matters we decided to stick with the absolute basic i ordered spaghetti and meatballs and my husband ordered the chicken parm inch sub my husband isnt as picky as i am so i was counting on him to enjoy this sub it is pretty hard to mess up a chicken parm sub my pasta came out and all i can tell you is that the sauce was brown it looked like gravy when i mixed it in with the spaghetti it somehow just vanished so it was basically like eating noodles with a hint of brown gravy it was the most disgusting thing i have ever tasted i took one bite of the meatball and thought i was going to throw up it was atrocious it was spongey and tasted like deer meat it was so gross my husbands chicken parm sub had the same doo doo brown gravy on it and the chicken was like rubber literally he could hardly bite through it when he said he couldnt eat this sub i knew it was bad he eats anything i for darn sure wasnt eating my dish so we just sat their staring at each other i forgot to mention the salad and texas toast that was served with the meal the salad was frozen iceburg with nothing else and the toast was a piece of lilly white bread with some butter and garlic slapped on it blllleh eventually the waitress made her way over to us and we werent sure what to say but i can tell you i have only not been able to eat a meal due to complete dissatisfaction twice in my whole life the waitress noticed that we didnt eat our meals and asked if we wanted a box to go um wow no we want to just get out of here we asked for our check and told her we werent really satisfied but that we didnt want to make a big deal no need for managers etc well one of the managers son to the woman who owns and cooks came over he offered us anything else off the menu to replace our meals we didnt want anything else from this dump we wanted to just leave and go eat we were starving and on a time crunch long story short they made us pay for the meal that we didnt even touch the owner came out and was extremely nasty she said she posted that they do not refund for food she then pointed to this itty bitty note on her cash register she said she cant please everyones taste buds so she is not going to refund anyone what so does this happen often enough that you have to have a disclaimer on your food that is terrible servie for a small mom and pop or just mom shop it was like they were used to people not liking their food so they were prepared to argue their point it was bizarre i dont understand that concept they said you can order a pizza or something else so they are still losing money by having to make a whole other meal either way it was their approach and the fact that the food was absolutely disgusting i would never want to support this place local or not i asked them where they were from because no one that was born and raised in italy would have created the mess that they did they were actually greek i suppose they just have a different way of preparing italian food because it was not authentic i looked back at those who offered such stellar reviews and realized that most of the people were from random townsareas maybe they havent been exposed to the real deal in terms of italian food so somehow this place was okay to them not me im telling you if you love italian food and have had real authentic italian food do not go here end of story our favorite pizza and a great family ownership and atmosphere we have a tradition on friday night we go and pick julianas pizza up and the kids as well as mom and dad eat it all also they have homemade coconut cream pie and brownies that are second to none hey looks like skyline chili from cincinnati maybe thats what it is pizza is awesome i tried really hard to like this place especially since upon walking in to the restaurant for a take out order i was met by what had seemed to be friends of the business who had given rave reviews my first try was with the meatballs and pasta good meatballs but i ran out of sauce half way through my meal strike then a last week i tried a bacon cheeseburger with fries and a side of mozzarella sticks ughhh where do i begin first off the burger was made from a patty second the mozzarella sticks had no crunch and were dry and seemed like they just threw them in the microwave strike needless to say i have since thrown away their menu this has been my favorite place to eat for years for lunch or dinner they have delicious sandwiches which you can get either fries or pasta salad i love both but i go for the pasta salad since i need to watch my weight their daily specials are great with my favorite being the fried baby flounder on fridays the tartar sauce is homemade and needs to be bottled and sold its so good i get extra to dip the fries that come with fish this is the one time i do get the fries you can also get the twice baked potato instead which are the best too the fried shrimp with the flounder is also great i think the batter they use on the fish and shrimp for frying is so light and makes all the difference their wings are excellent my favorite is the greek style wings their pizza reminds me of the old godfathers style pizza very thick and gooey with lots if cheese this place is not for you if youre watching your weight even though they do have great salads with fresh made dressing too yum always great food and good service best find ever the food is fresh and have all the favorites on the menu the even decorated it for christmas meh nothing special for me though im sure many people may like this type of italian standard italian food nothing i could buy at the grocery store my spaghetti was watery and had barely enough sauce to coat the watery noodles i work close by to this place and happened to be in the food lion shopping center when i stumbled upon this place none of my coworkers had ever mentioned the place to me before so already i was taking a risk but i decided to go for it pretty typical old fashioned family restaurant atmosphere no frills i have no issues with that the waitress was very nice and attentive too so no issues there either issue i ordered the chicken parm sub with fries the sandwich itself was mediocre grilled chicken with cheese and a trace of brownish red sauce not my ideal chicken parm it was fine to eat i guess just not a chicken parm issue the menu stated that the sandwich w a side is when i got my bill a diner style check you bring to the front for them to ring up it said no problem they included tax when i went to the front the total was umm why the double tax i decided not to say anything just vow to write about it and not return the unfortunately reminded me of a pizza place i used to work for that would pull shenanigans like this and that place is out of business its just very short sighted to overcharge and lose a customer even if they didnt overcharge me maybe it was a mistake laughing in my head i still wouldnt go back based on the food alone if not for the nice waitress would have been star the food this is one of my favorite restaurants ive been eating here since my favorite is an pepperoni with homemade sauce the mushroom and onion steak sandwich is so good when i go with someone we order one of each then split because we can never decide we also love the salt and pepper wings they are so crispy the deserts are homemade they are all so yummy the family this family is the greatest they are such nice people and very caring i stumbled upon this place when moving in the area on a snowy night they were the only place open the owner just smiled and invited us in from the cold like family its been years still so great ive since moved away and this is

{67714, Unlocked Global Phones, 1819 E Carson St South Side Pittsburgh PA 15203, this place doesnt even deserve one star they have a terrible customer service and all they care about it taking your money they treat you really nicely till they get your payment my mother was visiting me from abroad and needed a temporary sim card with no commitment so i went to this place unlocked global phones the girl that was working was new and wasnt trained well she screw up the sim card when she was activating it and we didnt find out till after we left the store the store was closed by the time we realized her mistake and we really needed a working phone that night so we ended up buying another sim card from another store that opens late i went the next day to return the sim card we purchased from them and explained what happened they didnt even apologize and they said that they could fix it now i refused and told them that its no longer needed and that i want a refund they strongly refused to issue me a refund and insisted that once the sim card is processed through the system they cant return it well thats not my problem they made a mistake and i dont have to pay for it after arguing with them for so long i ended up convincing them to give me a gift card and all they gave me was gift card while i paid almost for that sim card and i couldnt even use the gift card because everything is overpriced there theyre also notorious for having hidden fees and are completely not honest about the real cost upfront when you ask them make yourself a favor and avoid this scam store in a nutshell buyer beware the service was friendly the price was right the phone was probably stolen annnnd did not function as claimed i hastily bought an unlocked phone from these guys hours before my flight left we were leaving to travel in central america for a year and my phone had just died hence the haste and the need for a global unlocked phone though i realize that buying a used phone means some features are broken they said the phone checked out so i was very disappointed to discover that the gps of the reason i needed the phone didnt work the headphone jack didnt work the back camera was missing a lens and the front camera didnt work at all and some other little things so this is a phone that checked out for being fully functional now that i am back in the us i bought a us sim i cant activate the sim because theres a loststolen alert on my phone interesting that wasnt a problem in cen am so now i have a phone that i bought as a legitimate phone for that i cant use there are websites where you can check the phone to see if it is stolen youd think a store that deals in used phones would do that nope i trusted them i was burned and now that im trying to contact them again their phone number doesnt work and theyre not responding facebook messages thanks clarence of unlocked global phones youve really done me a solid buddy wow my experience with these folks couldnt have been more positive when my verizon contract finally expired i shopped around for a low cost plan sick of paying month a friend turned me on to global unlocked so i took my iphone s there they werent sure theyd be able to unlock it but they succeeded and set me up with a plan called pageplus i cant remember exactly what i paid cuz its been a couple of years now but it must have been reasonable otherwise i would have been upset lol i pay month for pageplus they use verizons network i only had to go back to global once looking for help with my voicemail i think i had guys huddling over the phone trying different things until they finally determined that it wasnt the phone but rather something with the new plan i needed a code or something they didnt charge me for that visit and i know that the friend who referred me has been satisfied he began to use global about years ago}

{77761, Green Leaf Promontory Pointe, 888 E Clinton St Phoenix AZ 85020, for the most part its quiet and very well maintained lovely surrounding neighborhood however now we are being forced to switch to all fluorescent light bulbs when we pay our own electric bills with a a threat of breach of your lease to refuse admittance from maintenance for the installation i came home to the dining room chandelier looking like a blaring ufo with the dimmer switch no longer having an effect to control the lighting needless to say i bought my own energy efficient soft white bulbs that i will be using from now on i have my own favorite shower head also energy efficient that i had to switch out when the mandatory aerators also were installed i am all for being green in fact i would like to see another recycle dumpster on the premises along with a recycle can around the mailboxes as far as saving energy the refrigerator in my unit is constantly running makes a loud noise when it finally shuts off twice in one year maintenance cant seem to find a problem with it i bet its wasting way more energy than a few new light bulbs can save started off great and ended very poorly my wife and i lived at this apartment community for months we were very excited about the price proximity to the mountain and surrounding neighborhood our experience quickly was spoiled by the apartment quality and management staff upon first moving in we noticed our air conditioning system was obviously broken and operating at an extremely loud volume after requesting maintenance twice to fix the ac they left the system pumping cold air but even louder than before we had the same sort of issue with living with a broken microwave after maintenance said nothing was wrong with it as my work begins very early in the morning i would leave before sunrise within the first months i would frequently see a large rat running around our apartment common area thankfully after some time i noticed large cages setup around the complex and never saw the rat again lastly and most disappointing is the staff is either dishonest with money or very lazy and not sure how to properly do their job either way their actions are inexcusable knowing our lease was soon up i took it upon myself to talk with the office about how to officially leave the complex without the complex communicating anything i was told i did not provide sufficient notice of my departure and then slapped with a fine after further discussing why i was being fined i then learned that their leasing systems had overcharged my wife and i over the course of the past months i was told this error would be resolved within a day or two after some days i did not hear a word i went back into the office and was immediately told i was about to call you i asked about the situation of being overcharged and was told it still was not resolved out of suspicion and curiosity i then asked if i had ever received the refer bonus from referring my friend to the complex it was never added to my account and i was told that there was no proof that they could see of me referring another tenant this forced my friend to come into the office and explain how he was referred and how he asked three separate employees to write down that i was referred prior to moving in then i had to go into the office two more times each time being told i was about to call you and was finally told i needed to print out a written notice to solve the issue i had to then go back to the office two more separate times before all issues were completely resolved i was given back money from being overcharged and from my referral but only after about total trips to the office and re explaining the situation to the same employee i would like to recommend this apartment complex to other future residents but after poor communication and having my money being played with i simply cannot have to agree what started off as really great turned into a nightmare and glad we no longer live in this shit hole first off the staff chris and nolen were great and really got things done the new people are lazy and incompetent charlene the short mexican is lazy rude and doesnt understand the simplicity of a smile to say this for is downright unpleasant is giving her too much credit the grounds are decent enough thanks to the actual hard working maintenance crew the noise level started off good until they allowed people noisey college kids who do not know what quiet hours mean partying until am on a weekday when explaining to office staff who already doesnt do any work they dont do anything about it literally said there is nothing we can do how about your job nope nothing is down getting in your rent in just one day late because you work for a living and couldnt make it in you have to pay an additional late fee again one day late to say i would recommend this place would say i recommend having all your wisdom teeth pulled while having a lobotomy done stay away from this apt eric is awesome i had to call the front office today because i had little boys throwing rocks at my window repeatedly who would not stop i called eric and told him what was happening and he said he would take care of it within minutes eric was out front of my place he talked to the kids and i havent seen them since eric got here fast was affective at getting them to stop and said he knew their parents and i shouldnt have to worry about it happening again old reviews might say some bad things from the past as far as how long it takes for staff to get things done it is no longer accurate ive been here since june and any and every call i make something gets done and in a timely manner i dont live here and probably will not after the experience with the office staff i had lived at this location many years ago and had a great experience however when i came back recently to look into renting from here again the management team made me think twice i walked in toward the end of the day and nobody looked up from their phones or conversations until i asked are you guys open i even had time to double check the hours sign before someone answers with that depends i explained i was looking for a bedroom the office staff just looked at each other like who is will to actually get up and do their job finally one of the ladies said to one of the gentleman there hey its your turn he took my id from me and proceeded to take me to a bdrm that was available now and took me right back to the office didnt show me any amenities or even mention them when i got back to the office with him he just unenthusiastically said so are you interested i said i will have to think about it he simply said well have a nice day then the office staff was so unprofessional unhelpful and rude lord forbid they actually do their job with a smile on their faces i could only imagine that if they were like this to a potential tenant that they must be much worse to people actually living there do not move here the apts are old and full of bugs i guess i was blinded by the mountains and surrounding neighborhood the parking is a mess after just two months my car was hit by the vehicle across from my space and mgt refused to get involved there is poor lighting and trying to get a straight answer out of the office is a joke they seem to have a high turnover with no one giving you straight answers they charge you a ridiculous late fee if youre one day late but they refuse to add your rent payment to the online system before the first so you can pay early}

{26588, McDonald's, 310 N Boulder Hwy Henderson NV 89015, we love to come here daily for a large diet coke and a fruit parfait the drive thru can be a bit slow at times but they always cook their hash browns to the perfect crisp i walked in for a coffee today i was looking a little more scrubby than normal and figured that the normal patrons and staff of mcdonalds might be a little more understanding than a coffee house i ordered a single iced coffee paid and waited at a table opposite the registers at the time i was the only one there but shortly after about people got in line i waited and waited and waited no coffee i thought that maybe theyd just needed to get their drive customers out of the way before moving on to my ticket but people after me started receiving their food minuted after ordering a single coffee i waited through line and handed my receipt to the cashier she said they must have skipped me and went to give the ladies my ticket by hand another minutes later i had my coffee and was on my way sorry mcdonalds i am not interested in waiting minutes for a coffee as far as mcdonalds go this one is one of the better ones i come here a lot check ins so far ive never had bad service here that i can recall the management must be doing something right kudos to you guys plus the kids love the indoor play area here its big accessible and closed off so my kids arent as tempted to run off and it has its own bathroom with a changing table hard to find in vegas they also occasionally have special events like ronald mcdonald visiting stars i pretty much only come here to treat my son so i took my son here because he loves to play in the kids playground area which is pretty neat for youngsters the food just isnt what i used to think when i was younger the fries are generally pretty good unless you get served some cold fries which is disgusting i had the double quarter wcheese bacon it was pretty good but the burgers are not served hot like many other fast food places i would like to see the cheese melted to my bun from the heat service was pretty much exactly what i would expect nothing too great but nothing to complain about either came here for breakfast since we missed our breakfast meal period at our conference i ordered a sausage egg mcmuffin meal it tasted delicious and not dry they got our order correct the first time not a lot of seating though but we were lucky to get one wow i cant believe that i havent written a review for this place its almost always busy morning afternoon night theres cars in the drive thru the staff is always kind most fast food places looks like everyone who works there hates their lives sometimes the guys on the late shift dance around for you real positive energy my order has never been wrong or incomplete here either if the food isnt classy or healthy enough for you dont eat here i like shopping organic and what not but anything in little doses will not hurt you it was the longest wait on drive through it was more than min i dont know what was happened but they could find some kind of solution we just got to stuck if i could post zero stars i would sat in the drive thru for minutes waiting for someone to take my order and acknowledge someone was waiting i honked my horn only for the female walking by to ignore finally the gentleman from the cash register came over to the window and asked whats wrong i explained no one was taking orders at the previous two windows and i watched the young girl walk past the window at least times his reply was she saw you but she said shes not working the window today are you serious its called customer service and team work evidently no one was working the window they had a line of cars behind me waiting at the previous window i didnt even want to eat there after this episode so i politely called mcdonalds hotline and drove to carls jr the worse service ive ever experienced at a mcdonalds probably a sign that i need to stop eating there there was no one line around am and bought hotcakes sausage mcmuffin with egg hashbrown mcnuggets and a mcdouble everything was stale my mcmuffin wasnt even warm the cheese was hard and cold the hotcakes were overcooked and rubbery mcnuggets hard and rubbery only thing edible was the hasbrown and fries also the lady taking the orders and making the food went out of her way to say that they were making it fresh yeah right what a waste of time and money i have never ever been this upset about the non service i have ever received from mcdonalds i am visiting from out of town and my son and i decided to go through this particular mcdonalds for a sundae on the way back to the hotel we waited in the drive thru line for well over mins what a complete cluster f the non service is the exact reason why we absolutely cannot think to give fast food workers an hour what a joke i wish i would have taken a picture to post the image of the so called manager that came to the window to assist me ha your so called management skills are lacking she slammed the drive thru window on me when i questioned her on what was going on in the drive thru line where you have a van spending over mins ordering and the employees fist bumping the customer and using profanity while there are over cars backed up just wanting to actually give mcdonalds our money well mcdonalds you have ruined it for me i am done and i will be calling corporate to discuss the much larger issue you have with this particular store frightening that this is how customers are treated hard to even give it star it doesnt deserve that keep driving and find a carls jr or in and out i am sure they will value you as a customer more than these rude people this location is outdated and slow quality of food is sad todays visit is probably my last to this location you can only burn me so many times before i give up i have gotten nasty salads a joke of a chicken sandwich and very slow service for the last time im done i noticed another review said how busy they always are its because they are so slow that location could do so much more they apparently have already alienated most of the locals what can i say its mcdonalds so its not gourmet or fancy just simply fast food i went through the drive thru and they had no intercomspeaker u had to order at the window with no menu in front of you lol my fries were old and my fish filet had very little tarter sauce on it so i am very disappointed in the service i received first i ordered my food and had to wait a long time i forgot to order a drink so as i was waiting i walked up to order it the manager i believe as he was collar button up shirt gave me the price of the drink but did not ring me up as i was waiting for him to ring me up and take the cash from my hand another lady employee came over and the man blurted out to her you know i have to write you up right they then proceeded to have an argument in front of me and forgot i was standing there to order after a few minutes he realized i was still waiting and had a different employee ring me up i then proceeded to wait for a while longer while you could distinctly hear them arguing in the back i have never had this happen before and i am very disappointed the worst part is i got home and there is no sauces for the chicken nuggets the happy meals didnt come with drinks and the toys were missing my kids were completely crushed i will be very reluctant to go to this mcdonalds ever again the lobby is kind of dirty and frequently you will see line workers out back smoking with gloves on my concern is excatly what are the odds they change those gloves between the dumpster and where the big mac is made hmm well my ice coffee came out with the correct flavor and my food was hot and served in a some what timely mannor the cashier was polite and didnt need me to repeat the order back to him xs so i count that as a win as well not a bad choice if yah wana get a mucky ds fix came here around am and had the best service chris was amazing give him a raise please food and service was excellent way beyond expectation i will definitely come back here again no toys with the kids meal and i ordered a crispy chicken sandwich and it looked like they let the chicken sit all day before serving it customer service was horrible no apology or anything not recommended stupid stupid stupid you idiots cant tell the difference between a filet and a big mac and yet you want an hour not a chance you arent worth minimum wage stupid stupid stupid people never again with mcdonalds never}

{28281, TGI Fridays, The Orleans Hotel & Casino 4500 W Tropicana Ave Las Vegas NV 89103, this tgi fridays is located inside the orleans hotel it is a smaller size tgi fridays ive been here on occassion to get a drink either after a movie or after some bowling so far ive always gotten very friendly service at this location the hostesses are okay but ive gotten nothing but friendly faces from servers one of the things i love about this tgi fridays is that they have the different ultimate sangrias im sure its not the only tgi that has it but for some reason the tgi fridays in the bay area do not have the ultimate sangrias and let me tell you the ultimate sangrias are sooooo good here great flavorful blend of wine alcohol juice and sliced up fresh fruit in the drink as far as the food theres not much to say about it its just greasy fattening american food i wouldnt come here for a meal but i have to admit a late night drink one of their appetizers is yummy why would a local go to a tgi fridays inside the orleans good question that was definitely a lapse of judement fiance and i were looking for somewhere generic to eat lunch that was inbetween our offices i expected reliable pretty good food i ordered the turkey burger with cheese burger came out without cheese and then the guy proceeded to bring me a cold slice of cheese on a plate when i noticed it had no cheese the burger was so cold the cheese wouldnt melt eww seriously throw it on the grill for a minute how lazy are you oh and the bun was stale and kept breaking off as i ate it and the burger sucked nothing good about it service was obviously bad too for where i was at and for the deal that tgif usually has this place wasnt half bad i could have spent a person and went to the bellagio but what would i do after i ate gamble nay here at the orleans they have a lane bowling alley but thats for another review the servers are nice but they had a lot of tables that were full so they were spread pretty thin so ill grant them some leniency so tgif has a special going on here where its buy one of the jack daniels specials get another one free now that saves at least off the bill and with a group of with an overall bill of we thought was pretty decent that includes the drinks so id go back here for a quick bite but remember youre not going to leave here thinking that this is the best of las vegas but youll leave content that you filled yourself without going over budget i wonder if rachel rays still doing her a day show well enjoy this tgi fridays is similar to the one at gold coast with the same hour happy hour specials this place is not as good as the one at gold coast the portions were a bit smaller yet the food was still good the service was way better than the food until a large party came in then the waiter couldnt handle the tables he had the drinks which was a washington apple was served in a extra large shot glass instead of a martini glass worst of all it tasted like cranberry with a squirt of crown last fridays for me the food is decent and its open very late am weekdays am on weekends since many of the restaurants in vegas arent open late at night its a very reliable standby to get some decent food late at night the southwestern mahi mahi or shrimp key west is great if you want something light as many of the dishes tend to be on the heavy side with alfredo type sauces or cheese ive also had their california club has avocado in it very good and one of the steaks cant remember which one but it was good they have a ton of different drinks but if you dont drink alcohol try the cherry limeade slush very yummy refreshing yeesh the server was friendly and the place was open at pm but it looks tired and dirty from overuse not neglect you have families with babies who drop fries all over the floor spilled drinks you name it as for the food must you ask its all the same chilis tgif applebees they get all their stuff from the same supplier if youre a tourist its edible i was really disappointed with the service here i went for a quick lunch on the tuesday before christmas and ordered a draft beer and a burger it took forever for the beer to come even after i managed to intercept the server to ask about it when it finally showed up it was flat and i went through the process again to get a bottle instead thinking they couldnt screw that up meanwhile i could see the bartender practicing his bottle flipping moves and he wasnt very good at that either the place was nearly empty but the server was usually nowhere to be seen when the burger finally came it was fine i guess but i was too pissed off to enjoy it i had to flag down caught the manager to get my check then i had to get her again to charge the meal to my room they needed to use a different check for that and no one asked me how i wanted to pay the place was not very well run and seemed indifferent to the customers i wont go back the clam chowder was kinda gross but the lobster ravioli was delicious the shrimp cocktail was pretty good but its half price if u sit in the bar the honey mustard chicken sandwich was gross i couldnt even finish it i had to leave and order something else in the food court waste of but i do have to say the angel hair pasta w grilled chicken and tomato fresh basil was good that i would order again just be careful what you order dont order something out of the ordinary who knows how it might turn out ps the margaritas were way too sweet tgi always good menu the service was good and they have buckets of beer for and margaritas that is an awesome deal for any casino ok this has to be the worst tgis i have ever been too the sliders were cold and flavorless my daughters pizza looked like cold pizza hut pizza my husband asked for his steak to be med rare it came well done when he mentioned it to the server he had them make another one this time it seemed like the cook said you want it rare mutha fr here you go it was browned on both sides and blue and cold in the center i believe that is rare not med rate so the manager came agreed and took the steak off our bill the server seemed to busy to even bring us refills i asked for waters to make sure that we has plenty to drink incase we ran out all around horrible go to fudruckers if your gonna eat here at the orleans my recent visit to fridays was great i ordered a oz glass of bud light and my boyfriend ordered a bottle of land shark both of which were only thanks to the happy hour special they have great prices on alcohol and appetizers during happy hour which just so happens to be all day everyday i ordered the gourmet mac cheese it was delicious the boyfriend ordered the jack daniels burger and his was just as good we had an amazing server named margarita who was fast very attentive and provided awesome customer service after both of our entrees and beers our total came to and some change i like that the only thing i didnt like is they didnt cater to the current promotion of all sandwiches and salads are due to the fact that they are in a casino im still wondering why this server was asking my id in order to get a drink i mean yes it supposed to be an alcoholic drink tropicolada or something like that but he was the server not the sheriff of las vegas not even the bartender and despite i showed my id i got a ridiculous strawberry juice lol it was the second time i visited this place but the first time this guy was my server i dont remember his name he was a caucasian young guy i just tried dont let this issue to piss me off because i wanted to have a little relax with my girl we ate some shrimps and asked an amstel light and everything started to get a little bit better but the ids situation was weird and annoying so if you go to this place and you look a little younger than trust me you should bring your id with you unbelievable lol my husband and i ordered the jack daniels steak shrimp and the potstickers as an appetizer as we were at our table i saw the bartender water down a couple of drinks belonging to someone else when they didnt quite make it to the rim immediately turned around and saw in big letters on the wall ultimate cocktails i couldnt help but laugh im so not a drinker so i dont even know if this is normal maybe a fellow yelper can clue me in anyway potstickers were great as was the ultimate strawberry shortcake we ordered for dessert the steak was quite dry the shrimp way too crunchy and the squashzucchini was soggy the jack daniels sauce mashed potatoes and broccoli were good though i went to this tgif yesterday and i order the babyback ribs i feel as though they have left it out for a while or it was overcook and it was also really dry and maybe they just put bbq sauce on the ribs but i do enjoy their buffalo wings it was spicy just the way i like it i think t g i fridays is a fine establishment especially for chain restaurants but this spot is terrible ive been here twice and have been thoroughly disappointed the first time my problem was with the service it took forever to be seated and to be served the second time it was with the food my wings were undercooked and my well done cheeseburger was pink then my dates well done burger was pink also by that point she didnt even want to send it back because we already sent two things back and on top of that the waitress took forever to return with the bill i know some casino restaurants are crappy because they dont rely on repeat business and make it up with volume but this one is pathetic i will not be back to this one this place sucks the food is so expensive and tastes like shit the gm is a nazi psycho who treats all employees like garbage so obviously theyre not in the best mood when they serve you i hate them fridays at home rules way harder than this stupid place the yards here are cheaper compared to that of the strips but getting the yard to the strip can be rather tricky specialty american recommendations for first timers jack service variety parking marc out dined pm ordered long island ice tea mango mai tai nachos this t g i fridays is located inside the orleans i came with my girlfriend and her brother upon arrival there was no one in line i approached the hostess and she told me there would be a minute wait if we wanted to have happy hour at the bar i gave her a confused looked as i glanced over to my right and saw tabletops in the bar that were empty and prepped for the next guest i told her okay and sat on the bench that they had for those who were waiting to be seated while waiting a couple came and was sat immediately in the regular dining area minutes after the couples arrival another group of was sat immediately at this point i was getting a little frustrated and just kept staring at the hostess she stood there with two other hostess just talking amongst themselves she finally decided to seat us after nearly useless minutes of wasting within those minutes not one person left or entered the bar so i have no clue what the wait was all about we mainly came here for a late night snack and enjoy some happy hour drinks luckily our waitress was really nice and serviced us immediately she was very bubbly and had lots of energy if it wasnt for her i would have definitely rated this place a star the food was good and the happy hour prices were phenomenal pros conveniently located inside orleans movies bowling dining food under one roof open late and tvs throughout the bar quick service at the bar cons horrible service at the hostess stand unprofessional demeanor at the hostess stand difficult parking tips ask to just sit at the bar itself not a table in the bar area for faster seating sign up for their email list to receive points for future discounts and also receive a free appetizer via email confirmation message i wouldnt go out of my way to come here again but since the location is pretty convenient ill be fair and recommend this place to those who are not in favor or driving around kill the night this is a one stop shop and has numerous entertaining amenities to keep you busy and complete the night with cheap drinks cheap eats we were about to eat at oyster bar but there wasnt a table to seat people so we went to tgi fridays wow the food was actually pretty good food from the kids menu is just as big as the normal entrees if you have kids order the ribs for and youll get more than a half rack of ribs for half the price i ordered ribs and lobster the ribs were slightly overcooked i completely forgot that i was supposed to dip the lobster in the melted butter until we left i also tried the lobster carbonara pasta which was the best out of all dishes the grilled shrimps from other entrees were nicely seasoned and grilled overall i enjoyed dinner we came by for lunch after checking out i wanted nachos and mama wanted a salad i figured this would be an ideal spot to facilitate those needs the hostess who sat us was not very pleasant she tried to seat us at the bar section on a bar table mind you we have our luggage with us and didnt ask to be seated at the bar when i asked her for a dining room booth she looked less than thrilled to be burdened with this task she may have even rolled her eyes behind her glasses our server was a nicer individual we ordered nachos and mama had a cobb salad mama gets picky with her orders sometimes this time she didnt get too picky she did ask for no bleu cheese though we thought it was simple enough i also asked for a lemon for my water needless to say i point those items out because they were not accomplished the nachos were good and mama tolerated her salad we ordered dessert the brownie with ice cream that was real good wouldve gone with stars cause the server was nice but the hostess and the missed items make me have to drop one call it before you ask what i was smoking when i gave this fridays stars hear me out i came in here for a late dinner during the week probably around pm it wasnt too crowded and we got to sit down right away the service was slow i think they were probably spread thin but our waiter was very friendly and other servers seem to help each other out the food was pretty tasty i may have been hungry but never the less i thoroughly enjoyed my jack daniels steak and shrimp dinner it did take a while for our food to come out which was surprising since there were not a lot of people in the restaurant but i have no idea what the kitchen sizesituation is for that place happy hour makes this a good find they have a big margarita for six bucks not bad good flavor definitely not watered down i gravitate towards the jack daniels menu items the ribs are out stars and they salads are definitely worth a look this fridays was cool we went on a not so busy day so that was a plus idk about my friends but i enjoyed it it was no different then the fridays in california my artichoke dip was on point and my pasta was delish id recommend fridays over the buffet that the hotel offered i was here on the th of july because it was the only place open i could find at pm everything started off great the hostess was nice and friendly she gave us our menus and told us our server would be with us shortly it took him minutes to finally show up it wasnt busy at all dont know why it took him that long he too our order for drinks and came back minutes later at this point im starting to get annoyed we finally ordered and he took our order and seemed confused we had to tell him times exactly what we wanted minutes later our hostess was bringing our food not the server wtf she apologized for the delay i looked across the room and saw our server handing drinks to another table really we were waiting a long time we were all pissed at this time and to make matters worse he got one of the orders wrong nothing remotely to what we wanted we didnt say anything because we wanted to eat and get the hell out i finished my drink and waited for the server to come by and offer a refill i waited and waited and waited he walked by our table at least x and not once bothered to check on how we were after minutes i finally got up and spoke to the manager i explained to him what was happening and he asked me to described the server i gave a brief description and he stopped me by saying oh thats ryan with a bit of bite in his tone i guess ryan has had complaints before the hostess brought our drinks and apologized again when it came time for the check he actually brought it to our table the nerve of that guy he came back to pick up the check and to clear the table the server dropped silverware on me as he was taking a plate off the table good thing i ate everything or else food would have landed on me that was the last straw i signed the slip and where it says tip i wrote none doesnt deserve one i have always left a tip behind and am always generous with but not this time the food was good but the service was horrible only good thing was the hostess i should have tipped her since she was doing his job tgi fridays one of my favorite places for a casual meal in a bar atmosphere mostly a fun place with mostly bar food theyre always busy so i give waiters a break if they take extra minutes for this or that the food is always good i have tried almost everything on the menu and enjoyed every bite of it this time i had the sirloin and baby back ribs and it was delicious the desserts are out of this world and prices are down to earth this is not a fast food restaurant slow down and enjoy life try this place youll enjoy it thank god i did this tgif is horrendous if you sit anywhere but the bar slow service or no service every time i go eat there then why do i go back because my family put a gun to my head tied me up and dragged me there so they can use their comps ugh i noticed it doesnt matter which server i get they will seat you and sometimes it takes mins before anyone notices you didnt even get drinks or place settings then it takes another mins before the server asks for your order once you get your food you better make sure you have everything you need when the server asks if you needed anything else otherwise you will not see her till shehe brings you the check its like they go in the kitchen to chat or something the place isnt even busy during the times ive gone this franchise ruins tgifs brand i usually eat at the fridays on sahara but tried this one out last night because i was seeing a movie at the orleans i have been here before and usually have a bad experience but this time was different i actually had a good time we were sat immediately which is rare on a saturday night at dinner time our server immediately greeted us and brought our drinks out right away we ordered the fried green beans which came out hella fast and were delicious as always i ordered the jack daniels pulled pork sandwich which was tasty as always and my son had the kids pizza with fries and he scarfed that down overall this time i had a great experience service was good and food was delicious what can be said about tgi fridays that hasnt already been said nothing the correct answer is nothing if youve been to one youve been to all of them no one is high fiving about going there no one is dropping to their knees in the rain crying nooooo with outstretched arms either the atmosphere is kitschy the food is good but not great the noise level is fairly high the specials are decent if youve never been to a tgi fridays before and if you have i dont know why youre reading this dont expect amazing things expect a meal youll neither regret nor remember three days later they do average better than anyone my co workers and i have made our rounds to quite a few t g i fridays the tgif at the orleans hotel and casino on tropicana avenue is our favorite we usually sit at the bar for happy hour the food and drinks are inexpensive and the bartenders are quite conversational and very friendly tgif is generally a relaxed fun atmosphere the restaurant is clean and tidy the service is great we always have a good time if you are in the mood to kick back with a few friends and grab some delicious snacks then i would recommend the tgif at the orleans ive never reviewed a flat out franchise before but i feel compelled to because ive never been to a tgi fridays before and more importantly i have too much time on my hands no i didnt go to vegas to eat at tgi fridays we really werent feeling that long buffet line though we were seated quickly and a server came out of nowhere and yelled hey hey hey scared the hell out of me i look at the menu and unsurprisingly most of that shit has meat in it even the salad they chop up chicken and bacon in that shit mannn i end up ordering this big ass potato with sauteed veggies in it the heaviest vegetarian meal ive ever eaten pretty salty and really oily not really a complain just something i noticed server was fine food was adequate i guess ill probably never come back theres gotta be better restaurants in las vegas that arent in smoke filled casinos not amazing not terrible the green bean fries are pretty good but the rest of the menu is blah love the happy hour this t g l fridays is located in the orleans casino which is the closes one to me because i live in the far south west of las vegas first impressions cute place my boyfriend and i were seated by the bar area in these cute little booths perfect for people i didnt know it but i went during happy which was awesome they had a small but nice selection of half off drinks and appetizers the customer service here was awesome our waiter wow i even think he was a trainee maybe thats why he was so nice usually i dont fall for up sales but this guy could talk so he up sold me into ordering some onion soup which was delicious i love onion soup but t g i fridays recipe was a lot different then the onion soups ive been eating idk it was delish i order a tomato basil pasta that my friend suggested me the portions were huge which is totally okay with me i love taking home left overs in total two entrees a few shrimp cocktails drinks and onion soup came out to about for two decent price for a great date night we ordered the jack daniels burger along with the combo fries the burger was good but the jack daniels flavoring was a little too sweet and thankfully they put it in a separate container im not a seet potatoe fries kinda guy but they were ok as well the service was good and the refills on our soft drinks were constant they even offered to make us a drink to go if we wanted to which is kinda cool they do not have any of the special or course menus not worth the drive to this location i would go to sahara and decatur or inside the suncoast def will not be coming back to this location dont want anyone else to waste there time coming here hope this helps good big box food joint with lots of different options nothing crazy good or crazy bad chilis fraternal twin i know what to expect coming in to a place like this food wise but i wasnt prepared for how filthy it was the booth we sat in right in front by the hostess stand was just caked with crud on the walls just sitting there made me feel dirty but we were hungry it was late so we stayed the service was absolutely the worst i have ever experienced anywhere our frumpy waitress never refilled our drinks i had to chase down the hostess to get another round we waited about minutes for our food to come out and it was typical fridays salty nosh the chicken with cheese was ok although my ankles were swollen in the morning as usual when i eat at fridays the night before due to the saltiness of their food after having to watch the degenerate gamblers and obnoxious loud fat people stroll in and out of there all night we wanted to leave the waitress gave us our bill then disappeared i tried to flag her down but we waited at least more minutes we got fed up counted out enough money to leave for the bill and were even generous enough to leave her a cent tip i normally leave at least a tip even for crappy service but crappy sevice is better than no service this place needs better management i was waiting for my room to be ready and noticed happy hour was just starting havent been in a tgis in about years plenty of seating at the bar that early and i ordered a bass and the potato skins app the potato skins would have been enough for people and i pushed down all but one they were ok and an excellent value at service was all right tgi fridays was on my radar as soon as the las vegas wranglers kicked colorados a the cmye hockey party go wranglers woo hoo just having stadium nachos and three beers during a hour game was definitely not the end of my dinner plans for the night my wife and i rushed over as soon as the game ended and sat in the bar our server was ricky hes a low talker for sure but very nice and knew what to say and when to say it fridays is just like every other commercialized restaurant around the universe old records pictures random rowing oars hanging on the walls and constant striped patterns everywhere you look probably even on the toilet seat covers but they do have one thing that i was super stoked to see they have a bell that you are supposed to ring if you received excellent service now when i see a bell all i want to do is ring it hard i was hoping ricky would be killer in the service game so i could ring that bell fingers were crossed to start out my wife really wanted the loaded potato skinsrefer to pic which i have never had before anywhere so i figured alright im down they werent exactly loaded or very good bacon yes is always good on everything but the thing they go on still has to have flavor it cant just be some semi soggy piece of cardboard anyways no bueno on the skins for our entrees we both ordered the jack daniels chicken sandwichrefer to pic the sandwich looked good and came with overseasoned fries the sandwich alone was pretty bad but when you drizzle the delicious jack daniels bbq sauce all over it becomes pretty tasty not amazing by any means but good the fries that came with were just way over seasoned they were so salty i found myself shaking each one trying to knock off all the seasoning before attempting to eat them during this ongoing battle with my food ricky brought both of us refills made some small chat and ended with a smile im not big on complaining about food and figured it wasnt that big of a deal at the time for dessert we had the chocolate caramel and pecan explosion forgot the name but thought this sounded awesomerefer to pic this dessert was actually very good it put a nice big smile on our faces the chocolate brownie was topped with vanilla ice cream and chopped pecans very moist brownie covered in rich flowing chocolate sauce nomnom before we left i had to ring that bell ricky was a good server and i went for the bell let me tell you it felt so good to ring that bell i would go back just for that feeling again all in all bell ringing is amazing and everyone should have a good bell ring daily head to fridays for your bell fix today terrible service went on super bowl night and after being seated we waited for minutes without even one server coming to our table to greet us much less take our order we saw servers watching the game instead of doing their job so we left on the way out we spoke to the hostess about the problem she apologized but they need to do a better job just terrible sat down and didnt see a server for minutes took our orders and had to track her down afterwards the salad was horrible and was so limp i couldnt pierce it with my fork after asking and being informed that they had one large hopper of lettuce she even asked if i wanted another salad hello its the same lettuce just bad bad bad all around this is usually my go to place at the orleans for drinks and having a good dinner i love the jack d ribs and shrimp combo service is pretty good only waited a couple of minutes before a waiter showed up food is always hit the spot absolutely terrible food paying a dinner price for lunch leftovers is anathema to my wife and me the wait staff are superb and very nice the orleans has other places to eat on site so avoid this one at all cost decided to try here with a friend for happy hour as it was the closest one to us this tgif is located inside the orleans casino the wait wasnt too long even though it seemed fairly busy it was sad to hear they didnt participate in the thursday appetizer drinks or for app n entree they did have a happy hour that had different specials appetizers cept for seafood and samplers beers and well drinks sangrias and ultimate drinks we caught them near the end of their midday happy hour no specials between pm by the time my friend wanted to order a nd drink our server informs us that happy hour had ended not that it was required but most places i go for happy hour usually my server will be courteous enough to give a heads up when happy hours about to end so we can get our orders in maybe im spoiled haha food was ok nothing amazing nothing horrible for the most part my friends cheesecake apparently had been sitting out too long as the outside of it was pretty hard and dried next time i want happy hour at tgifridays i might have to try another location and hope they participate in the good specials we dont have a tgi fridays in my hometown so my boyfriend and i specifically planned to visit this location on our recent trip to vegas we were seated right away which is always nice we then waited at our table for mins for anyone to even greet us or smile our direction when our server finally arrived the first words out of her mouth were im exhausted she then proceeded to complain to us about her last table as an excuse as to why we had to wait so long just to get waters we had enough time to decide what to order as we waited so long i decided to try the special the hostess told me about steak and lobster for what i didnt know is that it was on a time limit the server had the nerve to look at her watch after making us wait minutes and tell me i barely made it in time to order that i also order a cocktail at this time after waiting another minutes she finally brought my sangria followed by another minute wait for our entrees let me tell you this was the most unappetizing meal ive ever had to eat i am not usually a complainer even when im starving i eat some pretty crazy foods the lobster was not de turded for lack of a better word and my medium rare steak was too tough to chew we did speak to the store manager who willingly comped us some items but i left underwhelmed and still hungry after not being able to bring myself to finish my meal go for the steak and lobster special stay for the well dont stay just eat and leave cause this is tgi fridays and the rest of las vegas is just outside your door servers were friendly food was average decor was as expected everything was just as expected if youve made the mistake of staying in vegas too long and you want to feel like youre back at tgis wherever youre from well this one is here for you everything was wonderful from the food to the waitstaff everyones food was fresh and delicious id certainly eat here again good god parmesan meatballs take a meatball bread it deep fry it and serve it with marinara and mozzarella just wish the service was more consistent we ate here more than once on the trip lunch was great greetings at the door promptfriendly service and good food the late night dining not so much no greeter no water when we ordered no silverware with the food no one to bring the check hmmmm need a little work i understand its late but if the restaurant is going to offer late night hours they need to be sure the guest experience is up to standards all i want to eat at tgi fridays is the baby back ribs but my husband talked me out of it and we did the appetizer grazing thing i was pleasantly surprised we had the thai pork tacos parmesan meatballs bacon mac and cheese bites and the loaded potato skins it was awesome our waiter was very attentive and offered to re fill my soda several times he was right there when my husband finished his beer and quickly offered to get him another i soooo miss tgi fridays in hawaii pretty good service the appetizers were amazing and love the happy hour bartender and hostess were nice we like coming here for one reason excellent service we are regulars at this place and we really appreciate the customer service from all the managers in the past they have helped us so many times kristen was our waitress today shes nice she knows what we drink by heart and will always take care of us she really knows the meaning of customer satification while we were here watching the nfl jets vs pats game a tall bartender that saw a customer left his suitcase and he tried to get it back to him how nice was that hopefully that man remembered where he left it im sure well be back for more half priced apps i even signed up for a stripes card in the bar area mon sat from pm pm pm am is half priced apps on sunday are half priced apps all day sign up for their give me more stripes account opt for the emails text messages if you can i get amazing email offers every so often i also fill out the surveys on the receipt for an app how this place gets a two star and others get a rating mystifies me the food is predictably good it isnt a top line steakhouse but you dont pay those prices not to mention that it is designed to accommodate sports fans with the numerous televisions the staff is courteous and they have great specials we had steak and lobster for we took advantage of the special a couple of times while there i like tgifs in general and this being in a great casino orleans is just an added benefit i will definitely go back the next time we visit in a few months i love tgif ever since but i never wrote a review the food is good the dessert is not to miss and their happy hour on drinks is cherry on top this one inside the orleans is great place to dine after or before going to the movies or bowling or to gamble for the gamblers we are locals in las vegas we get tickets to concerts at the orleans so tgis is the logical place to eat not the best service there is not very good it is hit and miss sometimes we get great service sometimes horrible service we went there on nov th for the kenny wayne shepherd concert the hostess sat us and took our drink orders and only brought water not the beer my hubby order we had to order from a waitress did that got our drinks and appitizer but hubby ordered the garlic shrimp that was supposed to be served on risotta style rice uh what is that we thought risotta not so just burnt rice in fact it was all burnt we had no time to re order as we had a concert to get to just be sure when you go order a burger or basic food get there with plenty of time in case you bad service dont expect too much once again i stopped going to the other location on w sahara because twice the baby back ribs were dry and hardly any meat this was just so so and not much better then the one on sahara i used to order the ribs a lot at the sahara location and it used to be good they must be buying real cheap and not meaty ribs done with them i have had annoying visits with the fridays in the past but i decided to give it another try i am pleased i did i came in with my boyfriend for apps and drinks before a tuesday movie the service very fast and the server was very friendly the drinks exactly what i expected the food yum we shared their new tapas menu i loved the mac bites my boyfriend cant wait to try their meatballs again the price not great but not bad either the only downfall i was too full for a whiskey cake for dessert pretty good experiences all the times weve been here we love the jack daniels grilled items and sauce parmesan steak fries are amazing by the way this time our server christina with red tinted hair was pretty awesome our drinks was always refilled and we had everything we needed from the get go she did an awesome job and i would recommend to ask for her especially since past reviewers are unhappy with the other waitresses service food is pretty decent for a chain restaurant nothing too spectacular however nothing extremely horrible for thai tacos two steaks and shrimp two sides and sodas the bill was not bad had dinner here before a wranglers game on a friday night i was cautiously optimistic about eating here because i know these kinds of places can be hit or miss but we had a nice time there was a pretty long line outside waiting for tables both dining room and bar but it went by fast we sat in the bar area to have the happy hour specials apps sangrias bottled beer the food we got the pretzel sticks pretty yummy i think they were fried which is different than i am used to but i still liked them potato skins were yummy good sized and there were a ton of them loaded skillet chip nachos were delicious loved the cheese the drinks raspberry sangria pretty sweet definitely needed food to help balance it out but i enjoyed it the service everyone from the hostess to the waitress was very nice waitress was very attentive and checked up on us several times overall a good dinner experience and a place i would certainly choose over a chilis or applebees ive never eaten a a tgifridays before so when we got a two for one coupon in the mail i decided to give the place a try i ordered the stacked blue cheese burger and what a mistake that was the burger was so salty it was almost uneatable i made through about half of it before giving up if i do eat there ever again i plan to eat only salad because now i dont trust the meat seasoning worse experience ever with a restaurant meal american restaurant bar dim lighting and dont forget a big screen tv at the bar area unfortunately its not all around the restaurant the service we had was okay nothing spectacular stood out i ordered the shrimp chicken pasta and it was served with a spoon they gave me a spoon so i had to wait about minutes for the server to come by again to get a fork and the top layer was already cold i would come here once in a while not often though i am grading the food to me the basics have to be right before i can judge the whole meal i like soup and salad along with my meal and i really wanted salad with blue cheese dressing turns out they are serving a new white cheddar broccoli soup which is one of my favorites soup should not plop should not be goopy and shouldnt look like someone just opened campbells cream of mushroom and dumped it cold into your bowl yes it was hot but still that is how it looked and it tasted like overly salted canned soup i guess you cant mess up lettuce but the blue cheese dressing pretty sure that was straight mayo for these two items which tonight were all i ordered they were terrible i paid my tab and left after two bites one of each i have had other meals here that were okay not superb or even great but mediocre i just think that the basics should be considered the prime rib loft should take a lesson frim these guys busy monday night these guys rocked got me seated n the bar server was very busy food was hot beer cold not rushed and felt like i was at hone it kinda stunks eatung alone but my server took great care of me comort food and a couple of beers horrible ribs horrible service i will never come back here again i am speaking this as a person who used to work as a waiter back in my college days at first we ordered bbq baby back ribs and food was overcooked and dry waiters name was dean and he was clumsy nearly dropped the food at my friend well s happens i used to be a waiter for a sushi restaurant and ive had my bad days so we were compensated by getting different entree by the time we got our food we lost our appetite but still finished the shrimp pasta we asked for our check to pay the bill it took him minutes to close our tab because he couldnt get his priorities straight i recall having bad clumsy days such as putting entrees one over the other and end up squashing the bottom entree spilling drinks but ive never kept my patrons waiting i would close out the tabs and let the patrons go so that new customers can come and take the seats i would never come here again rather go to oyster bar next door or drive outside since there are so many restaurants ive had enough patience and tolerance with this place since i used to be a waiter myself yelps review challenge it was my last night at the orleans and i wanted to have some cheap before going back to the room walking around the casino i saw tgif figured its just like any other fridays there was no wait so i just quickly walked in and sat in the bar area service was quick and i ordered a glass of beer and some chicken wings food was on par like with any other fridays franchise and the wings were tasty with mild wings sauce lucky for me i was able to charge it to my room so i cab earn some points for my stay convenient location in the casino slow service though and sirloin was not that good tonight lined with a layer if tough fat used my entertainment book coupon so that helped and nice that you can charge to your room we ll be back but ill order something different decided to go out for a late night dinner and ended up at tgi fridays in the orleans our servers name was julie i think gave us the worst service ever looked like she was in hurry because she dropped off our and check at the same time like expected us to just eat and leave so we tipped her the minimum of because of her lack of service dinner after our movie date night it was a clean setup and friendly service we got seats in a timely manner our waitress was funny and gave great dessert suggestions so i truly appreciated that i wasnt too happy at the end of the meal when i saw the bill not because i was charged for something i didnt get but because for the amount we paid we couldve gotten the french market buffet next door all day pass i got ribs and lobster so the prices seemed appropriate however after it was time to pay one tends to correlate the price you pay to the satisfaction one feels and i didnt feel fully satisfied the food was good but not good the only thing i really enjoyed was the oreo ice cream pie dessert if it hadnt been for that i wouldve probably given a star review also like i said my server was nice so luckily for tgif it was fine there too but from now on i will probably go there just for that dessert nothing else there is worth that kind of money last visit to vegas went to the one at the aliante which i would say is better overall esp in service and atmosphere got the unlmtd app potato skin buffalo wings potato skins couldve had more on them and when i bit into a rotten skinned one and asked to get something else since theyre all i was told no but could get a new order dissapointing waitress was pretty good but the atmosphere of an older group staring me my husband was akward is it cuz we r interracial got more food than u idk but made me u comfortable went at am btw and all potato skin orders had least rotten skinned spot on a potato not too good wont suggest that to anyone beach bum drink alcoholic sucked mostly pineapple juice no garnishes wings were good and so were the ultimate grand margaritas prob wont come again though i went from saying thank god its friday to saying this is the worst diarrhea ive ever had on saturday as a chain i like tgif due to their jack daniels ribs which are outstanding but i came to the tgif in the orleans because a buddy wanted to hit up some all you can eat appetizers we chose mozzarella sticks and boneless wings mozzarella sticks were fresh and tasty with hot melted cheese right out of the fryer but they dont give you enough marinara so we had to keep asking they sprinkle some parmesan on top which is nice boneless wings never tasted like they were hot and fresh but not bad considering we got orders of each thats appetizers for service was extremely friendly but the servers minds were on another planet ordered boneless wings were brought potato skins the first time ordered dr pepper got diet coke ordered blue cheese for wings got ranch told them again we wanted blue cheese not ranch still brought us ranch the atmosphere in the new orleans is horrible we were sitting at the tables outside near the casino and for minutes the alarms were going off inside the casino as though there was a fire and the alarm kept going and going and going no one turned it off for a crazy amount of time considering it was a false alarm didnt enjoy eating through that also parking there is ridiculous i was here about two weeks ago but forgot to write a review food was good loved the peach sangria but our server was horrible my friend left our table to go to the bathroom she passed by our server who was talking sht about us to the other servers rude never coming back we still tipped her since we all work in the restaurant industry i regret doing that what were we thinking this place always has great food very impressed that our server lance and his co workers handled our huge party of some seemed a little overwhelmed at first but it was pretty smooth rolling its always good to have a server that is laid back with a good sense of humor loved the beer combinations i had the snakebite great combo cant beat the jack daniels burger yum kudos to the staff this is the worst fridays i have given them chance after chance and they always get my orders wrong and the quality is severely lacking dont eat here waited for a table for minutes the restaurant wasnt busy at all waited minutes for our server to greet us take our drink order again there was tables occupied server was the slowest ive ever had waited about minutes to order our food had to wait another minutes for our server to bring eating utensils then said im sorry i made you eat with your hands good thing we ordered appetizers tried to speak with a manager was told they were really busy last but not least emailed guest relations was promised a phone call back never received any contact back from any tgif members will never go to a tgif we love coming here to eat before we get seated at a table we always ask for brooke shes amazing fun to talk with in general shes our go to server when available food is always great you cant miss out on their dessert either i love that its at a casino we always play a little after lunch or watch a movie upstairs at their theatre our waiter was from detroit and way cool dude bottomless boneless wings were very good and able to take a bunch home the bar area was loud and didnt like that wish i could give less than one star as this was the worst dining experience ive ever had food and service were beyond terrible we had salmon with lobster and steak with lobster no amount of steak sauce or ketchup could improve the taste of the rubbery food these miserable entrees took over minutes to arrive and were both cold the waitress autum had no explanation for the delay and did not return to our table to refill our almost drinks she further dragged her feet with with the bill took almost ten minuets to bring the bill and another to charge us the manager offered free desserts as compensation but i did not want to waste any more of my time or taste any other awful dishes from this establishment which i will never return to we used to love to go to this tgi fridays but about a year ago the service quality of food was degraded yesterday we decided to give them another try using take out because i was having a meeting for lunch when i walked in there was no one waiting for a table and staff members standing around chatting i said i wanted to place a take out order the young man pointed me in the direction of the bar and said at the end is where they take the orders from the bartender ok st of all its a sunday in a casino in las vegas the bar was packed no seats at the bar or any of the tables i hipped my way though the crowd and stood at the end of the bar minutes bartender who puts bartender in a bar on a sunday in football season in vegas i waited and waited and waited she talked to the service station people she chatted up the people at the bar she flirted with the guy who was sitting seats down from where i was standing she chatted with girls who were standing next to me having a convo but never once said can i help you for minutes i had all my order prewritten on a green post it so if anyone from this fridays is reading youll know who i was finally a woman in street clothing came behind the bar and have a few minutes of chit chat she the bartender pointed in my direction she came over not that she could hear me so i gave her my list and asked if she could understand it then the bartender decided to come peek over her shoulder i said do you know how long it will take thinking id sit in the lobby she said at least minutes i said well ive been standing here the bartender rolled her eyes and said were really busy really i didnt notice at which point i snatched my list back and left but not before making a sweep though the dining room to count tables and the staff members were back in the lobby chatting now my biggest issue is that who in the tgi fridays corporate hq thought it would be a great idea for go orders being placed in a bar to go unless you are in nyc or sfo usually means you are going to get into your car and drive i actually ended up at a stand alone tgi fridays about miles away again sent to the bar to order and this time very prompt service but the bartender kept coming over and saying are you sure you dont want a drink finally i said drinking and driving dont mix wtg fridays you win the day thats sarcasm btw long wait for a drink no silverware and the most disgusting bowl of what they call clam chowder booooo we always enjoy at least one meal at this tgif each time we stay at the orleans which is times a year weve never had bad service we have had times where servers didnt check on us because they were busy with too many tables at once which usually means theyre understaffed but this one always has a lot of employees working at the same time mainly chitchatting at the hostess section up front so im not sure what the issue is the food is generally good the steak and lobster bargain isnt really you get about bites of overcooked lobster tail my biggest complaint is the dinner side salads i always have a caesar salad when i eat at any tgifs dont think ill be doing that with this location anymore their dressing tastes like a lime vinaigrette not disgusting but not caesar either and i always seem to get lots of the nasty bits of lettuce which i leave in the bowl its just a waste to order a salad here other than a few issues this location is decent not a fave but its better than the trouble of leaving the hotel and dine elsewhere plus we always get a bogo dessert coupon when we check in so that helps worst fckn experience ever we went here last week after watching hunger games and this rude ass host young girl w glasses just literally looked at us for a few seconds and looked away after we asked to seat a group of people like are you fckn kidding me we asked again and mind you we asked politely she never acknowledge us after that she looked miserable w her job ive never been so fckn pissed in my life that this stupid rude bitch had to ruin fridays my friends and i were so appalled that we decided to go somewhere else really like happy hour here the price is right my only complaint which is not unique to fridays its a lot of bars is the seating that is high tables i use a wheelchair and there is only one table in the bar at my height otherwise the table is at my eye level i was accommodated by the staff and the understanding people at the one low table but i would hope i wouldnt be forced to eatdrink at a high table to enjoy the happy hour prices only available in the at area lets just say right on time sunday night with my lady happy hour almost everything the staff on top of there game for a sunday funday relax drink eat an appetizer and caught up on espn with friends or whom ever this tgif was prefect for being on this inside of a casino this is a great place to chill out my girlfriend i came at pm on a sunday it was still happy hour until midnight we ordered jack daniels sauce chicken wings shrimp margaritas i was full a little tipsy when i left our server was great very friendly and attentive so we were here on a trip from san diego we usually stop by or stay at the orleans and we always stop in at fridays for a bite to eat either a meal or just snacks we have always liked this spot very convenient and friendly however there certainly seems to be a change and its not for the better we were in a bit of a hurry there was a little bit of a line to be seated in the dinning room so we chose to sit in the bar all we wanted was skins a cocktail and an ice tea so we sat at a bar table and nobody paid any attention to us so i got up and walked over to a lady behind the bar and patiently waited for her to take a quick break from chatting with an obvious regular customer she never acknowledged me laura went to another bartender and asked for someone to take our order she was rudely told that we waited because we sat ourselves in the bar the lady said she would send someone over but sure made it seem like we were putting her out laura mentioned her treatment to the manager who spoke with the bartender before we got our drinks eek sure seemed like the waitress thought we complained about her because she barely said a word to us for the first time or two she stopped by but then warmed up and was ok so we asked to speak with the manager again about the whole situation she apologized and made excuses i explained that we have been coming here for or so years and have always been treated well but this time was certainly different i asked her if she ever looks at the yelp reviews for her store she said no they have their own review system and dont care about yelp i told her she really should i explained that yelp is huge now and she could learn a lot about her store well the skins did arrive and they were ok nothing to make us go out of our way for again certainly unless yelpers start giving this place a better rating we wont go out of our way to eat here again the manager did comp the cocktail but we were running well behind our expected time but it worked out so when you are at the orleans for a cheer competition and you need lunch and a bloody mary stat you find yourself at tgifs we arent big chain restaurant fans but there wasnt much else that we could find immediately the hostess gave us attitude and we almost left but with no where else to go we tucked our tails and sat down from then on we were pleasantly surprised our waitress was fabulous cheery and helpful our food came quickly and it was pretty decent salmon can be scary at diners but my husband said his was great my salad was fresh and tasty and my bloody mary was excellent my daughter had a burger it was a little lukewarm but the burger itself was tasty just put someone a little less annoyed with life at the front desk and you will be a fine establishment the food was alright like any other tgif but our server ignored us i think she saw us maybe times never re filled my coffee this was far the worst fridays i have ever been too i will not be going to tgi fridays again service was bad food was mediocre at best very good service we came in on thursday in march during nascar week minute wait clean restaurant food well made great bartenders good service and tasty food this location is inside the orleans they always have spots open at the bar i am not a big fan of chain restaurants but my sister and i decided to grab dinner at fridays when we were at the orleans last night we were seated immediately and experienced perhaps the best service i have had for a long time a young gentleman named mars he was prompt and the perfect blend of efficient and friendly we both ordered the parmesean crusted chicken and were not disappointed everything on the plate was awesome some of the moistest chicken breast i have ever eaten i will eat there again when i am at the orleans had lunch here the other day unfortunately worse food service i have had in a long time server took attempts to bring a round of waters and a tea for people there were only other occupied tables during lunch first sign this was going to go south quickly finally placed our order a girl in the group placed a to go order her to go order came out after girls received their salads after minutes and still no appetizer when the fool finally came out after minutes half of the orders were cold and the other half were burned manager attempted to make our experience right by taking off this didnt make up of the girls not eating any of their food dont waste your time better luck at a fast food joint our server lance was great friendly courteous and genuine the food was great and the company was even better not usually a fan of chains we got roped into going here by another couple on our last night in las vegas we asked the hostess if the appetizers were still half price at happy hour she said they were but neglected to tell us one has to be seated at the bar to take advantage of the half price offer we only ordered one appetizer and shared it the shrimp cocktail and unfortunately it appeared to have been made ahead of time as the shrimp were very dry they werent bad they were just dried out which can happen quite quickly in low humidity and air conditioning so it would have been ok at for smallish dry shrimp but not ok at nearly and unfortunately our friends ordered two appetizers expecting half price the potato skins and the dry shrimp cocktail and also ordered a side of onion soup my husband and i were pleasantly surprised by the steak and lobster special all four of us had it was excellent we all ordered it with a fully loaded baked potato and a side of chefs veggies the steaks were cooked exactly the way we ordered them our waiter was chris and he did his best for us in a crazy busy setting our bill came to we only had water with our meals and our friends bill came to over they had drinks so in all the four of us spent about plus a tip the manager was not willing to adjust our bill for half price appetizers even after our waiter told him the hostess failed to tell us we had to be seated in the bar oh well if he had this would have been a star review quality of food was quite disappointing havent been here in years and it still is mediocre at best my lobster was burned and my ribs barely had any meat on them my dad got the steak and lobster special which is quite misleading for how small the lobster tail is i could get a much better meal at a restaurant like outback honestly i saw all the bad reviews after i had already been seated i was expecting crap service and crap food i got neither jeffrey was our waiter on a very busy friday before memorial day he was awesome brought water without even asking and my biggest pet peeve having an empty drink jeffrey brought a refill a little bit before my drink was even done he was on point the food after seeing the reviews i got scared and just ordered a burger i was completely surprised at how nice and juicy it was it didnt even need condiments the fries were a little bit over seasoned but still yummy we even had dessert something we never do we got the fudge brownie with vanilla ice cream ah mazing i wont return to this location one thing i cant stand is waiting for silverware to arrive more so after your food arrives its not the job of the hostess to bring napkins and figure out where our refills are i ordered the fridays shrimp platter it was ok nothing amazing and ive had better at other fridays locations our service was slow and it wasnt even busy im a pretty patient person and understand when its super busy that things have to wait waiting minutes for your waitress to come back to your table to get the credit cards to pay while she just stands around and chit chats isnt cool we looked at the bill and noticed an error so we brought it to her attention that she added an item to the bill that we didnt order i guess she assumed that we wouldnt see she then stated oh yea sorry it happens sometimes wow nice and the way she said it made it seem like it was done on purpose as if to round up the bill to an even amount so far disappointed we ordered potato skins and they came out looking fried and a blob of cheese that tasted microwaved nothing like they used to serve so far terrible one of the worst places ive ever been to i actually walked out upset we were seated immediately so the only good thing about this trip was there was no wait time but fyi happy hour only applies if youre sitting in the bar area it took minutes for someone to come over and get our drink order and another for anything to arrive a different waitress brought our drinks out and when we told her which one of us ordered what drink she still gave us the wrong ones truly i think maybe she was high meanwhile there are nothing but drunk people surrounding us yelling obscenities and being inappropriate and im sorry but one of the waiters smelled so bad that it was hard not to cringe every time he came around the original waitress never came by and we didnt see her anymore for a while it took us minutes to get anyones attention and request the check then another for my card to be charged and brought back out to me easily the worst tgi fridays ive ever been to and i will not be going back oh boy came here last night with the gf and we had a pretty bad experience we came in expecting a pretty good happy hour with some beers and good food right wrong first off we were originally seated in the non happy hour section so our waiter took us over to the bar cool right nah we were seated at a high table top and waited around minutes to be greeted and asked if we would like a drink tick tock tick tick waitress finally came placed our drink order meanwhile the bar is adjacent to us it took around minutes just to get a drink we put the food order in and the food came out faster than the waitress checking up on us and the drinks confused i was the only good thing that came from that night was the beers and the rib special that was falsely advertised my question was where is the foh manager ive worked in both foh boh and everything from the appearance and hygiene of the staff was horrible like disgustingly horrible nasty body odors dirty hands never again what great service our server was fantastic drinks where all ways filled and food came out fast very pleased with my experience came here yesterday for happy hour with my boyfriend we told the host we were there for happy hour which he said was only in the bar area we looked in and saw several open tables but he told us there would be a minute wait since there werent enough servers in the section no problem so we said wed grab a drink at the bar until a table was ready after waiting at the bar for about or minutes i told my boyfriend to go back to the host stand just to clarify that we still wanted a table he did and the host assured him that he would come to the bar to get us when a table was ready well that never happened after a few drinks at the bar we were starving so just ended up ordering food there which was fine but not what we had planned we were going to just politely mention it to the host on the way out but he was nowhere to be found my guess is his shift ended and he never told the next host about us as far as service at the bar it was friendly although somewhat slow considering that the bar was not very busy i had been craving a frozen drink but the bartender said she was new and didnt think there was a menu with frozen drinks on it but if i came up with something shed make it i did and it was fine nothing special though and i just really would have liked to have some kind of specialty concoction at a chain like this our food was decent nothing special though and i realized after leaving that my appetizer was not discounted for happy hour oh well this was not a great experience and with so many other options in town i doubt i will go back i dont get how they only have and a half stars it took a couple minutes for us to get seated but you need to understand stuff like that went theres only a server for the bar and one for the dining area not a problem to us we get seated and within a few minutes our wonderful server got us our drinks we ordered the nacho grande for an appetizer it was so good i loved every bit of it the pico was so fresh and amazing i got the jack ribs and shrimp and my boyfriend got cajun shrimp and pasta the ribs fell off the bones so tender and amazing the jack sauce was to die for the shrimp was so crispy and good i cried a bit his pasta was spicy but so good i really loved it perfect amount of sauce and just everything andrea our server was consistent when it came to refills and such she did really well next time i go back im asking for her im happy that the first time my boyfriend tried it he loved it will be back terrible the food was nothing special and the service was even worse to top it off there was a hair in my food dont go here the food was ok the stars is more for the bad experience i understand that its a huge restaurant but management can at least give proper coverage to the tables to ensure that all customers get a great experience while dinning we were seated quick which was awesome but after that everything else was on a snails pace it was very disappointing our server was tending to almost people which made the service very slow i was so thirsty and waited for my drink refill and water for a long time they were faster clearing our table after than tending to our needs just had awesome food drinks and aservice from my favorite tgifridays from lance i enjoyed a blackened salmon with a side salad not on the menu but my server lance made it possible even had a table touch from the general manager muneerah checking to see if everything was fantastic i will definitely be back sat down at bar was given a menu red head russian looking bartender hardly introduced herself and took forever to even ask me what i would like looked at menu knew what i want but bartender never came back got tired of waiting so i decided not to eat there and left ive been to fridays before but this by far is my worst experience its not the food but that bartender was horrible paid more attention to the locals and talked with people she knew i was very disappointed when i went there for some beers and the all you can eat appetizers the waiter said that everyone had to order that that means i had to spend for the special or my five friends had to order something they did not want huge disappointment since it was happy hour i moved to the bar area and got the happy hour specials the mozzarella sticks were awesome and the bar server was fantastic my family has been eating at this location for a few years with no complaints sadly that has changed a recent visit was more than disappointing went early to avoid the dinner rush was seated right away but waited minutes for a waitress to even come take our drink order took her more than minutes to also get the drinks ordered right away when she returned waited minutes for appetizers canceled the dinner order and left after appetizers this was before pm and there were only a few customers in the restaurant dont know what the hold up was but not willing to wait an hour for dinner while not stars for the gourmet level of food im rating for the quality of service accuracy of delivery and overall taste of the plate cajun chicken and shrimp pasta platter sorry ate before i remembered to take a photo for neighborhood food and really good service server was brooke i recommend i usually get great service back home so i expected the same when i was on vacation with the family we decided to go to fridays on our last day in vegas for the appetizers and to avoid the crowds we were a party of eight so i expected a long wait when i arrived the greeter didnt greet us she just said how many she immediately said its gonna be a while but didnt say how long she looked stressed so i didnt follow up my wife then asked and she told her min when we were finally seated they gave us a table in the back which was empty we were sitting for ten minutes before we grabbed a hostess and asked her for an appetizer menu she said she would get one for us but never appeared again the waitress finally came and we still hadnt even been served water i asked for water for everyone and she disappeared for another min she came back with the waters and took our orders we waited another minutes for our drink orders to arrive and minutes for our food when the drinks arrived one of the drinks was wrong my son had to wait another min for his arnold palmer a few of our meals were endless appetizers but because of our poor service we put in a refill on the appetizer order and that took an additional min to get overall im dissatisfied with the service the food was great but because of the service i didnt enjoy it at all a good place to have a beer or a casual dinnerlunch the service is ok nice place to order a takeout though great server thank you jessica you saved the night i would have left one star except i heard yelling in the kitchen those frigin morons behind the window argued with her about every simple little thing i tried to tip the hostess to be sat in a good section she didnt take it but apparently i was put in the right section fyi a bun should never be cold and ive learned to tip people ahead of time for good service my girl said you saved the night kind of surprised by the amount of bad reviews my father just stayed at the orleans for the last week and we stopped in here many times for appetizers and drinks mainly id reccomend bar area for seating happy hour has some good deals on appetizers and drinks in there always polite and prompt service from the wait staff food always came out hot and fresh i only wish this location was hours because the tgi fridays at gold coast is terrible compared to this one im sad that this tgif only has stars this is the only one i go to because we always receive the best customer service and our food has never been wrong on this night my friends and i went for a quick meal before going to piranha we ordered the cajun shrimp and chicken pasta i have to order this every time it has a little spicy kick the chicken shrimp and red bell peppers are what makes this dish my favorite i cant get enough go try it i believe its i also ordered a raspberry mint patron drink very good but i wouldnt recommend it with the pasta too much acid this drink was probably wouldve been cheaper to just get a drink at the casino lastly the only flaw i have is that if you dont sit at the bar when they have their half off drinks you dont get them unless you walk to the bar and pay every time they should just make it half off no matter what im sure they would sell more lastly i want the endless appetizers back do not eat here i went after i went to a movie i was starving i ordered a steak with a side salad it was about am or so when i left i went home took a shower went to sleep when i woke up i felt like death i woke up drenched in sweat had to run straight to the bathroom i had such bad pains in my stomach u had never felt them before in my life i went to the doctor and lord and behold food poisoning i will never return ive never had food poison before and i want to never get it again ever its horrible unless u enjoy bonding with the toilet i was wondering why this fridays only received stars on average from yelp reviewers now i see why and completely understand this fridays capitalizes on the fact that it is inside the gold coast dont think your going to see and get what you typically get from a city fridays add at least to more on the meals and you get less food secondly you better hope you get a good waiterwaitress the last visit i had the waitress seemed nice enough at first but as soon as i asked for more cheese for my salad and asked if it came with a slice of bread or crackers she said for a i can get you a bread stick i asked her to confirm that my salad didnt come with any bread oh why did i ask that she looked at me and said do you want the bread sticks or not i just declined and ate my salad in silence her tip was a note that said its not always what you say its how you say it and of course i left a cent tip to further express my satisfaction with my dining experience a tip is not mandatory and automatic people not with me im paying for the food full price the tip you earn e a r n im sure nothing will change at this location because its the only hour dinning restaurant on the property the only reason im not putting that waitress on blast is because i forgot her name shes lucky this time the food was great super fast service too our waiter donne was a fantastic waiter he got our food fast was very kind and most of all just a very nice man my little brother basically needed to go to the restroom keep in mind he is years old donne had offered to leave and take him all the way to the bathroom and back for us donne is the definition of a perfect waiter thank you so much this was my first time at this location and it was just alright the waiter was nice but kinda slacked on the service not much stood out but i have no complaints a group of fussy special dietary needs people caused a lot of extra trips to the kitchen for the waitress but she made no mistakes i was so full from the lunch buffet and the prior huge meals that i just sampled everyone elses dishes the jack daniels meals were good the sides were standard they gave us coupons for free desserts and the brownie sundae wasnt bad we were a bit disappointed that happy hour was available only in the bar most of the time four of us went to a movie and stopped at tgi fridays afterwards for dinner they have a special steak and lobster that was extremely good our steaks were cooked to perfection served with a very fresh baked potato and really good broccoli i personally am not a fan of lobster but was extremely impressed the flavor was tender and sweet i am definitely a fan and would definitely come back here service was fabulous my bf sister and i came to eat late night on thursday gabriel was outstanding and the service was over all phenomenal he promptly guided us through the entire happy hour menu and suggested some of his favorites since he was unable to accept our cash tip i decided to give a shout out for his excellent service will definitely be back thank you so much for the great hospitality our server was vivian and she was amazing she went out of her way to make sure we were happy the food was delicious conveniently located inside of the orleans this tgi fridays location is a great place to go eat before or after bowling the movies or just a nice place to go eat food at the prices are comparable to tgi fridays outside of casinos and have the safe offerings as other tgi fridays during my last visit our server was really nice and informative the food was up to par my friends ordered their wings and i ordered the jack daniels chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries i absolutely love the jack daniels sauce and the reason i get jack daniel entrees the sandwich was delicious but it was missing the fried onion strings their sweet potato fries were top notch in my opinion and made the meal that much more enjoyable overall a good place to eat if you like the uniqueness tgi fridays has to offer but nothing stands out to me that puts tgi fridays above the rest i went here in may the food here was pretty good but a little over priced especially overpriced were the potstickers the waiter barely acknowledged us and we felt ripped off for the service that we received the portions served were ok for the price we paid not worth a visit unless you want horrible service and ok to good food giving a star for a server whose nice but he took forever to get our box food to go and the tab food quality is good i mean i got the petite steak and salmon medium well with rice and brocolli atlleast thats good but the waiting sucks quality burgers here love the crispy onion bacon topping patty about half pound fabulous char flavor on the quality meat bun tender and fresh made daily saw the steaks lobster tail ribshint tgif place was packed at late night in the orleans casino its just wednesday actually its past midnight so its thursday this oleans casino is a definite fav of lv locals and our family i mean has lane bowling movie theaters an arena showing special events our super deluxe queen with living area with sofa couch coffee table even separate area with desk and chair cost us about weekdays ok now can focus on the oyster bar eatery heard their clam chowder is the boooooomb hostess screwed up in the beginning and got everyones order in line mixed up then she thought we were a party of not sat and waited for the server to finally come and ask if we wanted drinks i have been to this particular tgif a few times it is a great place to hit up before going upstairs for a movie p s that theater is on tuesday for all movies including new releases the service every time has been awesome friendly fast and frequently fun seriously the service a so why a star rating you ask good question to be honest the food is rock solid mediocre not bad not great but always right in the middle and it is not a bargain today for lunch i had a caesar salad that was fine in the past i have had bbq pastas all about the same right smack dab in meh the stand outs for me have been the burgers they are always good cooked well tasty with a small side of fries i suspect that is the answer stick to the burgers why go back is your next question i dont have a good answer for that probably because it is easy convenient and sometimes fine is exactly what you want before a bargain movie worst service ive ever received from the bartender i order a black blue ribeye with mashed potatoes and broccoli i get a well done ribeye obviously they dont know how to cook a freaking steak the server was great buttttt when they made my chicken sandwich it was wrong instead of bringing it back to the kitchen to fix it she wanted to just bring me out the stuff they forgot wowi got up and found the manager and let her know if i wanted to make it myself i would stay home and left i will never go back the steak and shrimp were good but we waited min for the ribs i understand it was rush hour but no apologies for the wait when the waitress handed me the bill i thanked her and she decided not to respond at all wow common courtesy is all i ask for especially when im a paying customer the only reason im not giving a one star is because the ribs were good and its a clean place if i could i would give this place zero stars i went here with a friend of mine we actually used to work at this location crazy how so much has changed anyways we were seated pretty quickly but it took our server min just to great us and hes had very little menu knowledge after he greeted us and grab our beers which were flat as hell we didnt see him for another mins to take out order after our order was taken we sat there for mins waiting for asalad and a pasta dish so we had the manager on duty come over and we discussed what had happened she couldnt care less so we just got up and left but know i see why the service is shit it starts with your management if they dont care you servers dont care and thats what we saw worst service i have ever gotten ever will never give this place my business again get your shit together and take care of you customers even if you dont care act like you do to make your customer feel more comfortable if the manager would have expressed actual concern it would have been a little different always come here service is great food is always good they are constantly changing the menu with new items ordered the spicey shrimp and chicken it was really good vivian is awesome was kicked off a high top bar was full told to wait in line table was never sat door girl told me its her companies rules and briad sucks her words im out will get my boston tea party somewhere else problem with fridays is that they have seriously lost their identity just another applebees happy hour only and alls well cocktails apps sangrias glasses of wine droughts are a decent deal do not expect service from the host or hostess at the front when calling in an order make sure you order from the bartenders this place is notorious for lazy service except at the bar i hope the managers and corporate read these reviews but the top shelf long island iced teas are delicious and will give your tummy that warm fuzzy feeling literally this tgifs has the worst service i have ever had in my life maggy is my waitress and she is absolutely horrible her attitude is disgusting along with her service attitude the whole time shaking her hair and head walking away while asking to order she never came out with my drink i had to ask another waiter for my orange juice unbelievable i sat for minutes with no drink not even a water i watched two other tables be served before me when they arrived after me i will never return here and i suggest you do not eat here even if you love tgif like me drive to another location dont waste your time here been here about five times for the steak and lobster deal excellent food steak cooked perfect times and good service our server was very inattentive i had to ask for a side of lemons three times before he brought them out he also brought out the appetizers after the entree itself the food is good but i would advise going to another fridays not very good service tried to flag down the waiter for minutes for lemon for my water finally when he brought the food i could get it now currently spending another minutes trying to flag him down again for tabasco sauce foods good service sucks they need to hire host that know whats going on thar worst tgi i ever visited i will never recommend this tgi ever nor will i ever come back i have informed my employees never to come here as well and explained my experience they said they would pass it on ive been to this tgifridays with my brother several times before seeing movies at the orleans the food especially the burgers are very delicious my brother loves the ribs which are half off on wednesdays though the staff is nice its quite difficult to flag anyone down to get something our drinks came way after our food was given to us i had a super lackluster experience with my family here in march but since this is my nearest fridays i relented and decided to give the place another try before heading to the movies at the orleans bad idea the same female bartender with red hair was there with her strange rude attitude despite seeing her i and my boyfriend sit at the bar and chat while waiting for the bartender to stop staring at her cellphone then she proceeded to polish things behind the bar despite our attempts to get her attention minutes later she walks over to us after i finally get her to look up and asks for my id immediately before greeting us or introducing us as someone who has worked in restaurants in nyc since the age of i was stunned i gave her my id then my order which she makes a face at for some weird reason she then took my boyfriends order we get our drinks placed in front of us and she walks away with an attitude i guess she was taking her hate for her job on us not sure but it was weird she comes back out of nowhere and asks my boyfriend if hes from chile and he says yes then she smiles at him coyly and gives me a dirty look not sure why so now shes rude weird to boot bless her heart i can only imagine what her problem was but she was nasty for the rest of the night especially after my man got weirded out by her flirting with him service was angry and slow to say the least do yourself a favor and order from the restaurant if not another location altogether gees lots of bad reviews here but we had a pretty good experience eating here during a sunday evening over the busy memorial day weekend we had appetizers bbq chicken flatbread which was excellent we shared potstickers which were okay but a tad dry probably because they were under the heat lamp but still good my entree was sizzling chicken and cheese and it was excellent a mix of cheeses with peppers and onions under boneless chicken breast accompanied by their delicious mashed potatoes really really good my husband had steak and lobster and said it was okay i think there are certain items you just shouldnt order at chain restaurants i did have their cadillac margarita which was not memorable even though the restaurant was very busy our server david was very pleasant and efficient but the girl working the hostess desk was a witch she wanted to seat us in the bar area at a high top table and i asked not to be seated there due to how uncomfortable it is and she got annoyed and to punish me said it would be another minute wait however another girl immediately sat us in a booth these are the people that hurt businesses but she didnt ruin our dinner i was there last night with a friend and the service was very lackluster and the shrimp cocktail was horrible e had to continue to flag our waiter down who failed to ever check in us and never asked for a refill i am a local that goes to the orleans often but will never go back to this location the shrimp was chewy and old for shrimp cocktail it tasted like old shrimp was served from prior days there was also lots of bats flying around disgusting i dont know about this place its a hit or miss sometimes i come here i get good service the next time i come i wait minutes until anybody notice im there in the bar area they do have good food and drinks but the service is not that great when i come with family the dining area is ok but the bar employees needs to be more active bar wasnt even full for me to wait as long as i did i was sitting at one of the open tables near the rail where you can people watch and the girl said that section was closed so i picked another seat and later when i came back from the movies the bar area she kicked me out had people there not like it was packed or anything also behind the is this blond girl who is just weird she has been there for a while because every time i come and see her working the bar area i sit on the other side away from her just a weird vibe with this place sometimes}
{44577, Apollo Motorhome Holidays, 5837 Boulder Hwy Southeast Las Vegas NV 89122, breakdown stars for renting brand new rvs ours had only miles on it although you never know exactly the modelsize you are going to get even though you rent a specific model they just give you one that meets your sleeping capacity stars for friendliness stars for getting us on the road quickly stars for having the rv stocked with utensils pots pans etc though we did have to buy a number of items at walmart like a salad bowl sharp knife scissors swiffer sewer tank chemicals etc stars for competitive pricing newer rvs for the same price as the nastier rvs rented by el monte and cruise america stars for not being able to handle the crowd of people that showed up to rentcheck in vehicles on our return it took us over an hour to return the rv and get on the road back to the airport luckily i caught one of the cab drivers dropping off a family and he agreed to wait for us to take us back to the airport stars for closing at noon on saturday and not allowing an after hours drop off return our plane was delayed getting in to vegas and they told us if we did not get there by we would have to wait until monday to pick up our rv stars for not renting bicycles and bicycle racks the lady actually told me that people dont bike around there really people dont bike in southern utah star for hidden feeschargesmisleading quotations the quote they send lists a bunch of items like bedding hygene kits etc that are included in the quoted rate but which are not actually included when you make your reservation they will not reimburse cab fare unless you actually have the receipt star for not checking that the sewer pipe was properly cleaned out someone must have pooped and released the black handle without taking off the sewer pipe cap and without having the sewer hose hooked up so the first time i went to take off the cap i had sewage explode into my face all in all if i were renting an rv in vegas again next month i would probably use them again because the rvs are new and there are not better options this office located in las vegas customer service is very bad people who work in the office no pay attention to customers check in process it takes couple hours we are customers of many years and for us this situation was surprised what happens new management or change the workers do something please worst time in my life when you ready go to vacation and met unprofessional people i had the worst experience with the las vegas branch of apollo the rvs themselves are great really clean and new with low mileage this company offers really good relocation deals and other offers however the staff is very unprofessional vera was working very slow with a condescending attitude she asked my kids to wait outside cause they were distracting her then she would always go out of the office to check other people in the whole experience with her felt uncomfortable unfriendly and downright rude finally finishing the paperwork at am we were informed that we couldnt drive off the lot until after i would understand if they didnt have the rv but it was standing in the lot ready to go yet we still had to wait i have little twins who were exhausted and bored and hungry it was a terrible disorganized unprofessional and unfriendly experience because of the staff just the facts sept th monday pm the vegas apollo branch is closed because its labor day i know that we need to return the rv the next day with a full tank of gas so i stop at the travelcenters gas station on dean martin dr in vegas to fill it up i let the pump work until it clicks and stops which normally indicates that the tank is full i look at the gas tank gauge and notice its a hair below full its not entirely unusual ive had vehicles before that dont show completely full because either the truck is on a slight incline or the gauge is off or the sensor in the tank is defective i take a photo just in case print my gas receipt as evidence and assume that i will be able to reasonably explain when returning the rv the next morning in just a few hours sept th tuesday am on the way to return the rv i stop at the sportsmans mini mart shell station at boulder highway which is miles away from the apollo branch i stop to top off the gas tank again i let the pump work until it clicks and stops print out my receipt and head over to the branch sept th tuesday around am or so our rv is inspected found clean without any damage etc we sit down to do the final checkout and our sales person dont remember the name and the rental agreement invoice says generated by identity fullname and has no other identifiable sales person information informs us that we will be charged for a full tank of gas because it was being returned at less than full i take out both of my gas receipts which have date and time stamps and explain that i filled up the tank twice most recently just a few minutes ago less than a mile away she refused to even look at my receipts repeating that everyone was warned to return the vehicles full i explain again that we made every reasonable effort and retained receipts as evidence she refused again to even look at the receipts and continues to repeat that everyone was warned she insists that they always fill up the vehicles and never have this problem i respond that i understand but clearly there is something going on with this vehicle i suggest that we take it across the street to check there is literally a gas station across the street from the branch literally across the street she looks at me and says i am not going to do this with you right now everyone was warned i ask her so i filled up the rv yesterday and again today what would you do in my place she answers i would call the apollo number my wife who is sitting next to me asks her so help me understand we were just at the gas station down the street miles from the branch minutes away from returning the rv and you want us to call the headquarters in australia to ask them for help with the gas gauge rather than having this conversation here now she answers yes the entire time she refused to once look at our gas receipts or acknowledge that there could be an issue with the gas gauge in the end after having filled up the vehicle twice we were charged fee for a gas tank which was full but where a gauge was just a hair short of the full marker horrible horrible horrible experience rip off place staff is extremely unprofessional unfriendly and rude during our pick up we spent half of the day waiting to fill out all paperwork and to pick up the vehicle stuff was super slow the rv itself was new and with low milage but very cheaply made but the worst are hidden fees we were coming to burning man and were informed about cleaning fee for extremely dirty vehicle on top of paying burning man fee we knew that well have to pay it because of the desert dust but suddenly we were informed we have to pay fee for dirty dishes when we returned the vehicle really isnt that included in general cleaning fee our bond was taken for drainage pipe that came off during our driving back weeks passed already and it is still wasnt processed and we still are waiting on how much well end up paying for that damage do your research there are much better companies in las vegas we rented a rv from this location for the thanksgiving holiday we were blessed and had a totally different experience comparing to some of the people who rented during peak season we loved it the staffs were friendly and courteous the vehicle was clean and new the price was the lowest we can find when we return the check out process was a breeze less than minutes we will definitely use them again if we will need another rv in the future yes the check in process was long way longer than renting a car hour however given so many paperwork and options to go over i think they cameron did an excellent job we werent pushed to purchase their insurance either everything was explained very though and clear even the rental agents were down to person on that day normally they have cameron was very organized had a great personality and easy to work with he tried his best to work with waiting families at the same time he bundled the demo with families in order to help us get moving as fast as we could that was very nice of him before we got there i called to confirm our vehicle will be ready jennifer was very patient and answered all my questions before we got there one thing to watch out is if you need to change the number of day you rent the rental office and reservation line in us cant help you you have to call australia office wont open until local time if you cant wait you will incur international charge on you cell phone because we have to return our rental car our group people were lingering in their lobby for hours they were very accommodating all all we had a great experience this is a great place to rent an rv cameron and the ladies at the decks are super friendly and they got us in and out quickly despite it being crowded the rig was in perfect condition and ran great only complaint was it would have been nice to be able to drop it off on sunday instead of monday but i guess all of the rv companies are closed on sundays will definitely rent from apollo again so much better than el monte best rv booking experience ever shout out to vera and camille thank you for your wonderful lovely customer service the maintenance crew completely dialed in our rv it was super clean and they took lots of care explaining the in and outs of the rv apollo offers all new rvs ours was brand new and in perfect working condition i can highly recommend this outfit they go the extra mile pun intended and made our entire transaction pleasant organized and wonderful i will definitely be booking my next rv from them again five stars we actually pick up our winnebago minnie winnie r apollo pioneer at the seattletacoma location for a one way rental to las vegas we received an email before pickup that they were going to be very busy since it was the last day they would be open till after july th we decided to show up before they had opened and there was someone there the checkout process was fairly smooth they were still prepping the rv so we were on the round around after getting there around got the value package which included mileage and lower deductible because of the mileage we planned on covering the unit was very clean and had about miles on it make sure you do a thorough walk around the gentleman who did it with me found damage i wouldnt have seen thanks the pioneer is a nice basic unit spacious enough us adults child the rv comes with pretty much all you need for basic cooking pots pans utensils cup coffee maker slice toaster the fridge is great has a separate freezer and worked well even when parked in a hot parking lot storage is adequate bathroom is nice with a operate shower stall the value pack gives you chairs table blanket pillow sheets this is stuff that you could probably get at a discount store for less then so unless you need the mileage or the lower deductible pass the driving experience is as could be expected with a old ford van front end with a big box attached to the back of it the visibility is actually pretty good the car audio unit was actually pretty good it had a large screen that had a rearview camera view available at all times great not only for backing up but for lane changes too it had a usb dongle which worked great with my iphone but no mini plug for aux input no bluetooth that i could find the pioneer had the smaller l v which was sufficient to move the unit suffered on some of the steeper grades the cruise control did everything it could to maintain speed it was great for down hill where it would use engine braking to maintain speed for uphill and even slight grades it would downshift and make for some serious racket overall averaged about mpg lkm in a crosswind you will need to hold a pretty good crab to keep it straight the front end ac worked well for the driving end of the rig and could rid most of the stuffiness in the rest of the unit and a warm day on a hot day if passengers will be in the back you might need the rooftop ac need to run generator the fresh water tank was full as was the lpg tank and the rvs batteries the level lights could be a little bit more informative showing only full empty the batteries never left full the lpg tank almost immediately went to s which got me a little concerned that i was going to need lpg pretty quickly if never left s for the rest of the days of the rental although we only used the generator i assuming the largest consumer a little over an hour trying to be a little conservative the water tanks were good for a little over a day for the fresh gray and black tanks servicing the rv was easy the dump tube is stored in the rear bumper pick up or bring a nice pair of rubber gloves for servicing also be aware a lot of gas stations in the us limit credit card purchases to if you swipe dip your card at the pump this might not give you a full tank especially important when returning unit we hit yellowstone moab bryce canyon and zion most spots are very rv friendly and parking wasnt that big of a problem july th week there are some lots and roads that do not allow rvs but definitely not a show stopper the return in las vegas was not as casual as a rental car return but it wasnt painful same kind of walk around no problem with leaving any left over supplies it the unit i am sure the beer etc didnt go to waste you have to return the rv with the gray and black tanks empty the closest rv park is at sams town they charge to dump looking back i thought we would need the generator more especially for ac while driving but that really wasnt the case we parked at rv parks every night so we had shore power if you plan on going off the grid boon docking you will probably need it more a very good overall experience we are thinking about buying an rv now if you have any question drop me a note this review is strictly for the company not the staff if it was not for the friendly and helpful staff this place would get rated negative zero one star is for the staffs help and how hard they work they were great beware of the following company says it gives you hours of wait time prior to coming in and a little less time if you pre register not we pre registered came in at am when our appointment was at pm and we did not get out of there until after pm we wasted a whole day of our tripvacation suggestion go in hours before your so called appointment time short staff its not the staffs fault things take long treat them well bc they are friendly and they work so hard to keep things moving along i work in customer service and social service and i know what it takes to run a smooth office with smooth systems in place and this place does not have the latter which is a reflection of the company suggestion if you scheduled for a day vacation make sure you consider one day of that just to get your rv especially if its a friday that youre picking up hidden costs we were charged to dump our waste which we did not know we had to pay for mileage cost is about mile if you dont get a mileage package suggestion get the mileage package it will save you timeeffort in calculating and money overall our vacation was great luckily our vacation did not rely on our contract with this company a group of us who went were glad we experienced this but that would be our last we def wont return to apollo}

{63803, Filiberto's, 6185 W Chandler Blvd Chandler AZ 85226, its the same ol irresistible bundle of greasiness youve come to expect from every other little mexican food joint that ends with an os except that its all shiny and brand new also they dont appear to be nearly as stingy with their hot sauce as some they are open hours and their horchata is delicious cheap huge burritos enough said a little less americanized than del taco any of the burritos breakfast chicken you order is pretty good for fast food mexican love the arizona burrito this is a clean and well lit restaurant and perfect after some late night bowling carne asada fries seem to be a little smaller than los favoritos in tempe but are still pretty tasty this is one of the nicer stores in their chain they food is good most of the time for fast food mexican we stop in a few times a month since its just down the street from us ii have eaten here several times and never had a problem good food clean friendly staff however i will never be going back after the other day as i write this i am in horrible discomfort from food poisoning after having the green chili plate i wont go into details but lets just say my life sucks so much right now my father accompanied me to the establishment and is also not feeling well from the carne asada plate that he had we both have very strong stomachs so in order to have a meal effect us so much speaks volumes on its own i would recommend great caution if still frequenting this place i hope nobody ever feels or experiences what i have been for the last hours i like to go occasionally on taco tuesday other than that i would probably never eat here i ordered crane asda fries they where so nasty almost no meat and the meat that was on them was likes rocks very old and nasty dried up meat i had to wait min for the drive thru so i came back today and spoke with the manager and she said since i thru away the fries theres nothing she can do for me i asked when the restaurant general manager would be in and she said she was and that she cant stand cheap people like me trying to get free food i asked for her franchise office number she kept my receipt and said she cant give it out and wrote down my info and said someone will call me worse service ever they need new management compared to other filibertos this one is very stingy and fairly slow getting food out i was just there and it was probably my worst experiencethough the time they shorted me two tacos or the time they forgot to make my breakfast burrito may be worse but they never inspired me to write a review i ordered a green chili plate special which usually inspires this filis to make the equivalent of a junior burrito thats fine with me i own a business and understand not wanting to go bankrupt the burrito tonight was and contained less than cup of filling yes it was so incredulously small i had to measure it it was so salty i was glad they gave me a lot of un used tortilla to offset it the counter girl was nice and friendly the best filis is at guadalupe and mcclintock the pecos one is also good and the ray and mcclintock one is probably third i know my east valley filis this one is so close to my house but i try to avoid it i am rarely disappointed by the breakfast bacon burritos can i please have more onions the onion slices in each brito are like giant toenails worst filibertos ever i love filibertos being that im a fan ive eaten at this location before just not for a while i like that this ones a sit down location as normally i go to the ones that are the walk updrive through ones i ate with my friend here for dinner tonight and we both enjoyed ourselves i went with my usual of the two shredded tacos dirty rice and refried beans friend went with the carne asada fries both were delicious mine was a bit greasier then normal but still was exactly what i needed the place was kind of dead when we were there but it was still good none the less they also have a salsa bar here which is kind of cool service was okay and the food came out hot and quick the only down side to this place is that the floor was super sticky in spots and could have used a good moping i also noticed one of the booths had a tear in the vinyl seating and hopefully it gets repaired soon i know this place is just a filly bs but who wants to see it go into slum status anyways even though the food was extra greasy last night its still my favorite food to secretly eat even though its horrible for me i do not recomend this place this is not good mexican food the tortilla for the burritos are gross food lacks flavor and service is horrible great i apparently visited the worst filibertos in the area what can i say it was late and we were starving the food was alright but nothing special kind of overpriced but the portions are pretty big staff was a dud except for the cook in the back who kept smiling at me and telling me to come back again i like their little condiment bar but it was not very well kept and very dirty i definitely wanna go back just not this location i like filabertos but this location seems a little off doesnt taste fresh or something just not the same as others ive been to cold food look at the refried beans never seen anything like this not even good my burrito shall i just call it tortilla because it hardly has any meat if you want filibertos just go to the one in ray its just about minutes away from here bathrooms are clean though so a gave it a two stars i love the carne asada burrito the steak is juicy and tender i would give a star rating but unfortunately when it comes to breakfast they never get my order correct i always order the steak and egg burrito with pico de gallo pico cost extra i always get charged for the pico but dont always get or i get a bacon and egg burrito instead when i do get the right order it is always good and i can never finish because they are big i went to taco tuesday yesterday got the worse food poisoning from the chandler location i usually go to the tempe location never had a problem tempe filbertos always had great quality fresh food i was very happy when i arrived at filibertos i have not had a great tasting carne asada burrito for quite awhile i could not eat inside so i ordered to go instead for it smelled like a nasty locker room i only live a minute away and was so eager to eat my burrito but it turned out to be cold and though i might get food poisoning or diarrhea ive tried this place over and over and over since they took over rallys again they have yet to satisfy me on my receipt says exactly what i want but they always get my food wrong i always ask for the same thing super nachos with extra pico ill either get with no pico or no meat or no cheese or something messed up again right now tonight i go and try one more time because my husband seems to like them which i have no clue why and i ask for the same meal super nachos with extra pico i get chips with nothing but beans guacamole and sour cream on it and extra beans like wow this is not a difficult order why can you not get it right i am not wasting no more of my time or money coming here anymore please do not waste your time or money on them just go down the street a little bit of the ways and go to los favoritos they are always on point and never get it wrong stopped in today had a carnitas taco i will say a little greasy salsa station has delicious roasted jalapenos yummy salsas they have one that is a creamy texture possibly mixed with sour cream very good they also offer hot carrots an onion mixture the bar too best filibertos ive been to yet clean restaurant good service fantastic tasting food fair prices will be back to try more on their menu you would think a taco would have more meat hot sauce is always watered down and i dont see how you can reasonably charge an extra for cheese and sour cream on a burrito total disappointment the shredded beef taco was a deep fried taco that had more lettuce and tomatoes with cheese than beef wheres the beef i was hoping for a better taco when they cost each i felt like a rabbit grazing when i was expecting to feed my inner tiger point being if you cannot even get a taco right then you have issues with the rest of your menu its a taco the easiest thing you can make in food industry i aint coming back ill try a different place to get my taco fix sadly jack in the box tacos are better than this place and cheaper thats saying a lot also all you want hot sauce thats very runny you decide otherwise they had tv for you to watch and kept the place clean probably the worst fillibertos ive visited i normally have their giant breakfast burrito they must use their stale tortillas because they always seem to flake and break they advertise them for because i think that there is only scrambled egg inside if youre craving mexican pass this one up i used to like coming here i thought this was the place that came close to the mexican food in ca but that all changed we ordered orders of carne asada fries and was ready to chow down when we got home as we were eating my boyfriend discovered hair under the fries im talking about long hair from a girl hair probably down to your shoulders it was disgusting never have i ever saw hair this long in food we didnt even eat the other order just threw it away because we were so mortified every time i think of carne asada fries it just freaks me out this chandler and alma school location never fails to surprise i like filibertos but this place seems a bit pricier than some of the others and they always skimp on portions you never know what youre gonna get as far as freshness and flavor goes i have gone to the elliot and dobson one many a times just to avoid this filibertos and i live in walking distance i always tell myself never to come back but i must say i am guilty but only after a late night of working and dont feel like driving far and getting out of my car i really shouldnt be surprised da bafroom i have only been inside this location once a long time ago and did not visit the bathroom shame on me yes i know but being that its one of the newest fili bs i would imagine it being a fairly clean and ordinary bathroom may need to make one more stop someday to update this portion of my review to be continued i usually stop by in the morning to grab a burrito before work the past few times ive gone ive had an older lady take my order she always seems upset never a good morning or any professionalism to make the customer feel welcomed its always a snappy attitude and and a straight face never mind the fact that the portions arent what they used to be or the fact the food is just ok i had the same burrito at a different filis and it was a lot better i might stay away from here just because no one wants to deal with a bad attitude first thing in the morning i have been here many times they are ok but the other filibertos are better the portions are always smaller at this location and often they mess up my orders they only order they havent messed up is when i go for taco tuesday the salsa bar is one of the better ones as compared to other locations i prefer the location at mcclinktock and ray as they are always consistent there is a skinny mexican guy who works overnight he doesnt give a shit about your order and doesnt give a shit about you ive ordered many times here during after hours and he has fucked my shit up im sick of it so im yelping his ass excuse my language avoid this place during midnight hours he will fuck your order up and laugh about it with the cook im half mexican and could care less what someones ethnicity is im just trying to make you aware that you need to avoid the skinny mexican guy at filibertos on chandler during after hours he is a complete dumbass with a negative attitude any filibertos i go to with exception of chandler theyre always on point chandler filibertos sucks at overnight worse service i ever had ordered worth of burritos for a work meeting got treated like complete shit rude little skinny guy at the counter should be fired he ran around and complained about the size of my order i tried to call and give a heads up but know one answered the phone i will never ever come back to this place ill up date on quality of food after the meeting update on food food was acceptable but cheese in burritos was not melted this is a pretty clean and big filibertos the food here is pretty good and i did not have any problems here with the people working here also in a pretty well lit area so i dont mind eating here late at night}

{30080, La Khaima, 142 Avenue Fairmount Ouest Plateau-Mont-Royal Montreal QC H2T 2M5, quelle experience jy suis alle plusieurs fois je vous le recommande fortement la bouffe est succulente et surtout chaque fois on nous fait decouvrir des plats et saveurs differentes le chef proprietaire attigh se fera toujours un plaisir de vous raconter quelques unes de ses meilleures histoires venues du desert bon appetit the ambiance is very unique and authentic friendly and nice service the food has very strong taste its up or down soup was amazing i had better moroccan food in the city but this place is different moroccan tea is very good price was person perhaps the only mauritanian restaurant in montreal la khaima is one of the best options if you are looking for a place to eat in the mile end area the decor is warm and cozy with cloth covering the ceiling and giving a tent like atmosphere the owner attigh acts as server cook host and entertainer he is a really interesting character and was the subject of an award winning documentary http vimeo com the menu varies but everything i have tried there has so far been excellent the cuisine is very similar to moroccan cuisine and the menu usually includes one tajine and one vegetarian option you can ask for a sample platter containing the various menu items of the day the mint tea at the end is one of the highlights of the meal it is sweet and intensely fragrant and as a bonus attigh turns the process of oxygenating the hot brew into a fun show to watch la khaima is a real treat and is highly recommended we came late in the evening for dessert and tea both were great but not as great as chatting with the owner who entertained us with stories the food here was very decent the soup stewed vegetables and chicken were delicious however we were also served stale pita bread from the grocery store and the lamb sausage was quite dry in fact one of the sausages was rock hard which put a damper on the meal the service however was downright terrible there was only one other couple in the whole restaurant but we still waited half an hour between soup and main course worse still the guy took our main course dishes away and offered us tea which we happily accepted and then he took forty five minutes to bring it to us he kept reminding us that he hadnt forgotten our tea but every time we looked up he was just standing around we were exhausted from waiting around but we still wanted to try the sweet mint tea which looked very good turns out it was so sugary that it was barely drinkable and then to top it all off at the end of our meal he told us how much to tip him its strange that all these other reviewers mention how nice this guy is the only possibility that i can think of for why he was so rude to us is maybe that we were a same sex couple who came in holding hands but i dont like to assume peoples motives for their behaviour so who knows maybe he was just having a bad day our family of four had a wonderful meal and delightful experience at la khaima the menu is limited and changes each night the night we went the meal started with a vegetable soup not sure what it was called then there were three tagines to choose from two vegetarian and one veal the owner atigh greeted us warmly and offered to provide us with a selection of each of the dishes on the menu that evening along with a hibiscus drink and a tea ceremony at the end of the meal each tagine was delicious especially the veal dish which was sweetened with dates but what really made this a special experience was hearing from atigh about mauritania and the camel races and treks he organizes to support the nomadic culture there byo in mile end that i tucked into for a friends bday dinner last week and couldnt have been happier to find myself in such a cozy port in the storm we sat in the shoes off elevated area surrounded by big pillows beneath the billowing tapestries that patchwork the ceiling water was served in cool glass carafes wine bottles popped bowls of hot dahl served and then giant stoneware dishes one vegetarian one chicken one veal which i didnt try but folks raved over the chicken was moist and slightly spicy and the vegetarian had lip smackingly good potatoes after the meal we were served hot sweet mint tea that was a perfect kick back out the door into the cold the restaurant was short staffed that night so the owner was cooking and serving and he did an amazing job juggling it all with a smile we paid a flat each plus tax which seemed like a fair deal for the massive mounts of meal and the great good vibes this is a real special place with a very special chef and owner atigh ould he will wine and dine you and charm you with his stories about his life growing up in western africa as a bedouin nomad the food is always delicious filling and made with love he always has different dishes whether you are vegetarian or gluten free he can adjust to your needs he ends every meal with a tea ceremony which is always my favourite part he also opened a cafe attached to the restaurant serving only mezzes his famous atighs hibiscus juice often he adds ginger or mint and hibiscus popsicles all delicious you will lose all sense of time here so its a great place to go for a birthday dinner or to catch up with an old friend when in montreal take advantage of the presence of its many north african restaurants the food was great the meal lunch at least came with an appetizer a tagine and some delightful baklava and mint tea for dessert i ordered a chicken tagine that had olives and couscous mixed in it was awesome my friend ordered a vegetarian tagine which had peanut sauce and some veggies mixed in it i tried a bit of her dish and it was delicious as well i loved the atmosphere of the restaurant the decor is beautiful and the owner is very friendly i really loved the ambience of this place and the service it looks like nothing from the street but it is very charming inside there seemed to be only two guys working the room and perhaps even the kitchen and things went really quickly the food is worth trying and i only gave it three stars because it wasnt the right food for me i kind of wish i could give it more because i liked everything else so much i just wasnt into the flavours so much but give it a go and see the diversity of montreals restaurant scene is on of the things that makes it so fantastic and la khaima contributes to that being in a group we we seated in sort of booth complete with comfy pillows the table was a little lower herethan usual which wasnt the greatest for eating but that is my only complaint really the food was really good here although i cant remember the names of most of the dishes we had a table dhote menu which included a variety of dishes served family style we also had a hibiscus ginger drink which was very refreshing as well as mint tea which i thoroughly enjoyed the owner is very welcoming and does a great job of explaining the dishes to you he also served us the hibiscus drink according to the custom from his home country which i thought was a nice touch apparently the pitcher containing the drink has to be put on the table for all the guests to see before you can serve it anyways definitely check this place out if you get a chance i love the atmosphere of this place very chill and even romantic we sat on the floor on cushions and it was fun service might be a tiny bit long but it didnt matter because the food was amazing the owner is great he really knows how to take care of customers and the best part is that is very reasonable and byow so much food such good much wow cant really write right now i a so full from the giant meal i had at la khaima not sure who these people are saying they didnt get enough food we had leftovers despite being very full they must be very fat or have extremely high metabolisms for normal people you get a lot it is very good great service a little unconventional at times but really sweet good tea great dessert and i dont even like sweets it was really good so good im going to laugh a bit la khaima is the first and only mauritanian restaurant in the entirety of the known world and universe this is of course according to the very charming and affable atigh ould the first in the world people the first in the world and it just happens to be right here in beautifully sunny like the sahara desert montreal monsieur ould just happens to be the chef sous chef pastry chef proprietor chief executive officer entertainment accountant waiter barman barmaid prom king and queen busboy owner and chief bottle washer of this highly highly esteemed establishment keep this in mind when you come here and for gods sake be patient seriously all you little uncouth philistine pipsqueaks you know who you are impatiently squirming in your seats whilst writing on your iphones about how you so ought to bad mouth this place on yelp had better shut right the fuck up if you know whats good for you because papa bear is looking at you like your pretty little head is a pot of honey la khaima smash i was pretending to be papa bear in that fun little scenario by the way seriously though folks this place deserves at least four stars right off the bat for ambiance alone if not the full monty of five stars haters gonna hate and they need not apply trust in me for like george washington i too cannot tell a lie this place is super super suuuuper good the food is outstandingly sumptuous and youre bound to have a great time if you relax and let go of time just for a little time first of all our anthropomorphic conceptualisation of time doesnt actually exist and secondly it definitely doesnt exist here bring a bottle or two of your favourite pinot noir or malbec take your shoes off and sit cross legged or even better lay back with your head resting in the lap of your favourite friend or lover and look up at the billowing tapestries that line the ceiling take a tab or two of lsd thats lysergic acid diethylamide for all you trippy chemists out there or do half an eighth of shrooms or smoke a doobie or drink a mickey of gin or get all spacey on god its so beautiful the colours man the colours those lamps you see are authentic from the sahara this place is one of a kind errbody in the club getting their bedouin on where else are you going to go to for that nomadic mauritanian berber cuisine you so dearly crave thats right nowhere else why remember because this is the only place in the world enjoy we went to la kahima with a groupon for two our deal was supposed to include appetizers a choice between main meals vegeterian chicken beeflamb hibiscus drinks tea and dessert of the day turns out thats what everyone gets groupon or not as thats all they have as soon as we arrived the owner explained us that instead of letting us choose each one of the three main meals as it was stated on the groupon he was going to put all three choices in a platter for us we thought yeah why not sounds good again turns out thats what everyone gets whether you like it or not not everyone however gets the same portions according to this dishonest establishment everyone else around us was there with a groupon as well and while they all got the hibiscus drink it wasnt even offered to us as an option even though we technically paid for it the owner told us that for appetizer he would bring us a choice of different dips with pita while really we got a platter with a bunch of canned corn and peas and a tiny bit of a not so good zucchini dip the people sitting beside us got different types of dips including the eggplant one which is the one i really wanted to try the owner told us that regarding the main course there was no lamb only beef and we agreed to it ten minutes later our neighbors got served lamb and beef meatballs we got beef meatballs in our platter our neighbors got again same groupon same amount of people lastly we were not served any water until minutes after we arrived in other words this place is a very smart money trap be aware definitely not worth the groupon of taxes tip stay away we went to this place with a groupon the owner offered us a special meal because he supposably really liked us as guests we would get to taste every type of tagine chicken beef and vegetarian that seemed like plenty of food for three people they started us off with a soup quite tasty but my cousin found a thick black hair in her soup not ok and then to make matters worse she found a little piece of bone i dont think this is part of a traditional pea soup right we complained and the waiter apologized the owner said he would make up for it with a delicious three type tagine platter when we got the tagine platter it turned out everyone around us with a groupon probably had exactly the same thing the owner was obviously just fooling us in telling us that he would make us something special on top of that the portions were quite small really not enough for three people afterwards we got our desert small pieces of almondpaste mixed with sugar i was actually crunching on the sugar disgusting after this dinner disaster was over we got our bill paid it and didnt leave a tip the owner yelled something at me as i walked out the door probably about not tipping the whole fiasco was finally over my advice stay away for those who are looking for a pleasant restaurant experience in addition to eating succulent food this restaurant is a must the atmosphere is original welcoming and certainly unique friendly great atmosphere prix fixe price point a bit higher than one would expect generous entree but small appetizer and dessert worth the experience visited this place last summer my friend had a half off coupon the menu on the chalkboard had what was included in the coupon for roughly the same price so not much of a savings especially if you factor in the we pay taxes and tips on the full price the food was pretty tasty the portions were not huge at first the service was pretty quick since we were alone but come tea time it took them minutes to serve us only after we flagged a waiter the place was never that busy to begin with he had time to serve the full tea service to his buddies who came just for that while we were waiting a couple came in and started making out right in front of everyone this is an open restaurant the vibe is like a north african tent so they were in full view of everyone and they kept at it while we just wanted to leave those two issues aside i would go back probably for take out a little late on this post i ate here with a few friends this past summer and it was an all around amazing experience the meal price was fixed and included an appetizer main dish dessert and teadrinks as the food comes in courses plan on spending a bit of time here the experience is meant to be savored and enjoyed not rushed through everything was absolutely delicious not only was the food amazing but the decor atmosphere and service were great as well after having lived in west africa although not mauritania previously this restaurant and the restaurants owner gave me everything that i missed about that part of the world the hospitality the culture and the flavor although i currently live in buffalo i will drive back to montreal to eat at this restaurant again i highly recommend it great place the atmosphere was cozy the meal price was fixed and included an appetizer main dish dessert and teadrinks the portions were huge and you could bring your own wine its such perfect my familys experience here was truly spectacular this small place has a warm and authentic feel with colored fabrics hanging from the ceiling and other moroccan decor with two rooms one with low benches around tables and one where you sit on the floor to eat the owner i presume was very warm and came out to greet us right away the entire menu was just what he had written on a chalkboard for the day which he carried around with him soup a vegetarian entree chicken and beef we couldnt decide what to get since they all sounded amazing so he suggested getting a sampler of everything on a bed of couscous and we ordered that for just per person the owner speaks perfect english and french the first course was the soup lentil and chickpea with cumin and other spices delicious next was the main course which came out on one huge platter for all four of us the beef was my favorite cooked with dates apricots and plums and so tender that it fell apart effortlessly with a fork it ended up being the perfect amount of food for four hungry people when we finally finished we were ready to go and asked the waitress for a check she agreed but the owner came back and said no no please we still have tea and dessert for you a few minutes later he came by with hot sweet tea served with a flourish poured into the glasses from several feet up paired with teacakes all in all the incredible ambiance warm and generous owner unbelievably delicious food and the great value for the price combine to make this place a wonderful destination that i couldnt recommend highly enough we had a pleasant experience here we got in early and were seated right away the waiter owner was very friendly to us the menu is very short catering to everyones taste there is a veggie chicken and beer option available we had to wait a while to get our food and we were the only ones in the restaurant but no big deal really what really will prevent me from rushing back quickly was the price we each got a soup shared a dish of cous cous and had some tea for kind of a rip off but worth checking out its hard to find cous cous absolutely delicious food from the owners native mauritania very short menu but dont let that deter you everything on it is superb vegetarian and gluten free friendly as well the owners hospitality is genuine refreshing and knows no bounds you feel as if he has invited you to his home the shoes off policy and batik draped decor make the experience that much more warm and fun good for romance as well as large parties and so cheap you get a lot of food for just cad i cannot believe more people have not rated this montreal must allow sufficient time for the personalized service though honestly i get why people like this place i do but i was just underwhelmed but the whole experience decor is cool it feels mostly authentic but it does looks a little worn and tired restrooms are sad think super thin toilet paper grimy sinks supercheap bright pink soap but not disgusting or uberfilthy our hostess was friendly and nice quick and eager to explain everything essentially as others have pointed out you get some sort of soup then tajines to share and dinner ends with tea and dessert all this for per person now this sounds like an awesome deal but ive had the same type of meal for roughly the same price with much more frills and thrills and better appetizers granted it was not mauritanian but it was either moroccan or algerian which is close enough to compare soup lentils spices it was tasty it wasnt so much hot as flavorful buuuut it was just missing a little something it came with pita bread on the side which was just dry and flavorless i actually saw the guy in the back take them out of a bag and cut them up it was the same kind you buy for the cheap at the grocery store meh tajines we had varieties all in the same plate to share its essentially couscous with something else we got vegetable chicken olives and beeflamb with dates what dates i didnt see any that was pretty darn good highlight of our meal for sure it was quite savoury but i dont know our plate didnt feel exciting or very jazzed up presentation was ordinary from reading the previous reviews i was sort of expecting more dessert some kind of almond cake or was it orange nothing to write home about it was a little dry good but nothing special came with traditional mintgreen tea tea was pretty good but quite sweet all in all we had a good time definitely deducting star for cleanliness half of the glasses at the table were dirty and i mean fingerprints and little bits of crusted food so to me this place is no more than a and if i take into account overall cleanliness maybe even a its comfort food for cold weather and the berber tent getup can be fun for a group its inexpensive but it doesnt feel like you get your moneys worth so will i be back probably not but i wouldnt be opposed to the idea unique decor warm service and delicious food the menus fixed and served family style everyone shares from the plate portion size is pretty much the same regardless of the amount of people you are i think it fills a group of pretty comfortably good ambiance food wasnt tasty what to say about this a m a z i n g place a piece of africa in montreal the food is delicious and served in a very special way in a big dish where each one can serve yourself the sentiment of sharing the food seriously sounds silly but its a piece of home away from home im not from africa but im from a place where youll find lots of african influences brazil if youre looking for something different from the french way of serving this is the place we tried two different dishes one was made of chicken and the other was beef both amazing the owner works in the kitchen and he is very friendly dont forget to ask for the famous tea they serve i will be certainly back its one of the best african restaurant in montreal hands down the place is just like in the khaima in the african desert it showcases the african northern culture at its best nous sommes alles manger a ce restaurant avec des amis puisquil etait un apportez votre

{7847, Firestone Complete Auto Care, 3540 W Bell Rd Glendale AZ 85308, i have been coming here for almost years for service on my vehicles and they have always been fantastic to work with not once have i ever called into question their assessment of what needs done to my vehicle nor have they ever tried to encourage work two years ago for some reason i took my car to one of the brake specialist places because i wanted to take advantage of a brake special the place told me i needed rotors calipers etc to the tune of i told them um no went to firestone and they told me i only needed pads and i saved over lat year we went to a kia dealership on camelback rd because my wifes ac wasnt blowing cold dealer said the compresor was out it wasnt warranty work and it was several hundred dollars took it to firestone and got a call an hour later that the ac belt had frayed and slipped and it cost me about these guys are very honest and fair they do not cut corners and may not necessarily be the cheapest place around but their work and work ethic are solid i really like the quality of products they offer and have purchased tires for all my cars for years at firestone i always get the road hazard warranty because it is valid at any location and they are all over the country i have had to use the warranty many times because of a nail or something else and it has paid off for me service department is always helpful and friendly quick very courteous service i mean service like the old days and ill now go out of my way to come back big thanks to dan for getting me in and out in a flash very impressed excellent customer service very friendly have been here twice and they are great folks who genuinely do care honest reliable and they dont try and upsale for things you dont really need i highly recommend them very friendly and their prices were great not to mention their are lots of coupons for them they answered all my questions and helped me with no problem ill definitely go back for more service very happy dan is the man we took our mustang into firestone for balance and alignment they squeezed us in and the garage queen was riding right by that night great service and nice staff had a small issue and dan made it right they have earned our repeat business for sure thanks dan its hard to find a good trusting place to get your to get your car worked on a friend recommended this firestone to me and he was right dan was professional knowledgable and nice i cant say enough the guys at firestone are very personable and accommodated my schedule to get an oil change done i will be back they did not try to oversell the service and checked other details in my car after i told them i was about to take it on a road trip i will be back i show up at they close at was on the and hearing a loud flapping noise pretty sure the car was gunna blow got there and the guy came right out and found the plastic cover thing under our front hanging down he fixed it right up it was like minutes of the guys assisted both very friendly and curtious life savers firestone at th ave and bell road what a great place my truck broke down on my to work so since i was with in miles of firestone i had my truck towed there at in the morning nothing is open in this area so i sat in my truck to wait for firestone to open while sitting there i see the manager show up at in the am he entered the store and did his morning routine at about am he came out to me sitting in my truck and asked if he could help me with my truck and invited me into the store to wait for the other employees to get here so he could help me with my truck the professionalism and concern for a customer is the best customer service i have seen in along time i give nothing but the best kudos to this firestone store and thanks from all i have for thier assistance at this point im convinced all firestones just suck this should really be zero stars dont even bother coming to this one i read the online reviews before deciding to go into this store and they live up to the reviews the guys behind the counter were very personable and willing to help they didnt try to make me buy a bunch of things while i was there they didnt try to take advantage or anything of that sort i will be back there again for sure i started taking my car to this specific firestone location several years ago despite there being several other firestones closer to my home i continue going out of my way to the th and bell location for all of my maintenance needs i have a toyota yaris with almost k miles on it and my goal is to get the thing past k during this time about of the maintenance ive had done in the last six years has been by these people one of the things that i hate about many of these auto maintenance stores especially the ones at dealerships is that you can take your car in for a simple dollar oil change and theyll bring you back a laundry list of items that they try to scare you into getting done if you decline they start pressuring you convincing you that your car will break down if you dont buy into their bs what they fail to realize is that this high pressure approach is what drives most customers away if its not broke dont fix it fortunately they keep that to a minimum at this particular firestone while they occasionally give me recommendations based on my mileage such as all those damned flushes and high mileage oil that ive learned is not necessary theyve never pressured me into getting anything that i dont want and if they do find something that needs changedfixed they always tell me without making any exaggerations ive never had to wait more than a few hours for any work that needs to be done and find the staff to be very honest and professional highly recommended this shop has received a lot of business from me over the years service has been ok i send my wife in once for a simple nail repair in a tire and what happens they try to sell her additional services and send her off with the tires all improper inflated nice job it takes one bonehead move like that to destroy my trust in a shop ill be passing this information on guaranteed within an hour of this review i get a bogus generic response from firestone acting like they are about customer service its just them trying cover there butts on social media instead of providing quality service at there shop next time do ethical work and you wont get a bad review i love the customer service i went to this firestone to replace a tire due to a nail they went over the different tires brands and prices i chose two toyo tires for my front wheels i asked if they could get me in and i had an appointment at pm they end up replacing my front tires and did my alignment and gave me time to spare for my appointment the mechanic was really nice and even said he knew i was in a hurry and he would be done shortly i would recommend this location to anyone they made my transaction stress free found a small nail in my front tire and went into this firestone location to see if they could take me as a walk in i was expecting to be turned down and asked to make an appointment but i was wrong the guy told me that the tire required a simple patch up and that they could squeeze me in if i was willing to wait total job took about minutes and the mechanic even showed me the nail after it was removed all the guys here were friendly polite and professional most importantly they made me feel completely comfortable despite the fact that i barely know anything about cars or maintaining them our rental mini van got a flat on our way back to los angeles so we drove up to this place and it was very busy as it was also christmas eve but matt managed to squeeze us in matt took care of all the paperwork and had his team change our tire super fast to get us back on the road i think it took longer to unload my kids than what it took to change the tire thank you matt they were great my grampa got his tires replaced and an oil change he had nothing but wonderful things to say and they are very fair prices ive been coming to this firestone location for over years and theyve always taken great care of all my automotive needs quite possibly my favorite thing about this shop is the fact that they are willing to help me prioritize my maintenancerepair needs based on my available budget and they never try to pressure or guilt me into services i dont need or dont need right away for most minor repairsservices they can get them done while i wait if i need to leave my car there for the day they are always good about keeping me informed of when my car will be ready there was one time a repair they made didnt work properly and i was stranded on easter sunday with a broken down car they took full responsibility and made me whole never once trying to weasel out of anything i can go on for days citing examples of their integrity and professionalism but suffice to say i trust these people implicitly firestone firestone firestone this firestone actually really impressed me in the beginning i didnt have such a pleasant experience at the location in portland oregon however this firestone in phoenix arizona off of bell road is excellent for oil changes brake work and other services this staff provides good service and are quite humerous they work very hard communicate every well as a team keep up the ethical and efficient work impressed with the management team too really impressed with this place i had an issue with the power steering leak in my honda odyssey and a couple of other auto care shops recommended replacing the power steering pump and also the power steering rack and pinion the total amounted to atleast but dan and others at this store confirmed after a gud patient analysis that replacing the pump alone for is sufficient highly recommend this place for not exaggerating and helping the customer spend only on the must do things thanks stars we needed new tires we had already went on line and was quoted about so we set an appointment called to confirm and they didnt even know about the tires being needed for one two we show up and they say we have to have the tires mounted and balanced extra per tire or you could pay for rotation and balance we had no choice and paid it no discount given when we were buying the two tires anyway then we get a call that the tire light will be on because the tps is not in the new wheels it would be another to add that well the light is not on once we picked it up and the wheels do in fact have the tps sensors in them when told they didnt this is our first timeat firestone and our last they took care of my issue and i am very happy for them doing that they listened and i appreciate their
